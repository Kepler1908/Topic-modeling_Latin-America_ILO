.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  November , SITRAPREN and CUT Autntica indicate that: (i) Executive Decree No.  of  provides for the readjustment of minimum salaries and wages for workers in the private sector; (ii) through Decision No.  dated  August , the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MTESS) regulated the increase in minimum salaries and wages for press workers; (iii) Decision No.  dated  August  extended article  of the aforementioned Decision No. ; (iv) Executive Decree No.  dated  June  provides for the readjustment of minimum salaries and wages for workers in the private sector; and (v) through Decision No.  dated  June , the MTESS regulated the readjustment of minimum salaries and wages for press workers.
.The complainants allege that: (i) for the second consecutive year, the enterprises Editorial AZETA S.A. ' Diario ABC Color (hereinafter enterprise A) and Editorial El Pas S.A., Diario ltima Hora y Diario Extra (hereinafter enterprise B) have refused to comply with the aforementioned decisions setting the minimum wages for workers in the newspaper graphics sector and the MTESS has failed to carry out the oversight function conferred on it by law; (ii) the enterprises have not taken part in the work meetings of the National Minimum Wage Commission, playing down the importance of this delicate issue; (iii) without any argument and to the detriment of the workers, enterprise A filed an action challenging the constitutionality of Decision No.  of ; and (iv) despite the fact that for seven years SITRAPREN has been negotiating a collective agreement on terms and conditions of employment with enterprise A, to date the enterprise has not agreed to sign it.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government sends its observations, as well as those of enterprise A. First of all, the Government indicates that the allegations concerning the application of the minimum wage for workers in the newspaper graphics sector fall outside the competence of the Committee on Freedom of Association. The Government indicates that: (i) while the National Council on Minimum Wages is a tripartite body, the representatives of the enterprises referred to in the present case are not officially members of that body; (ii) enterprise A filed an action challenging the constitutionality of Ministerial Decisions Nos /, / and / (the outcome of which is still pending) and, prior to the aforementioned decisions, most of the workers in the press sector received a salary higher than the legal minimum, established by mutual agreement with the employer; (iii) the MTESS extended Decision No. / through Decision No. /, meaning that at this point in time the complaint made is barred; and (iv) on  July , the MTESS issued Decision No.  regulating the readjustment of minimum salaries and wages for press workers, meaning that the complaint being made by the complainants is no longer valid (the complainants are making a complaint against Decree No. / and Decree No. /, as well as against MTESS Decisions Nos /, / and /).
.The Government further indicates that: (i) on  October , SITRAPREN filed a complaint with the MTESS for non-compliance with Decision No. / of  June , which amends the salary scales of the newspaper graphics sector by enterprises A and B. In this complaint, SITRAPREN indicated that in  it had already reported non-compliance with Decisions Nos / and / to the MTESS, in connection with which an action had been filed challenging their constitutionality; (ii) as a result of this complaint, on  February , the Collective Dispute Mediation Department of the MTESS Labour Directorate summoned the parties to a tripartite meeting for  February ; and (iii) in a memorandum from the Mediation Department dated  May , it was reported that the deadline had passed without any of the parties concerned coming forward to give a procedural boost to the case, demonstrating that they had no interest in this case.
.The Government states that, although no collective agreement on terms and conditions of employment in enterprise A has been registered, such a collective agreement between the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) and Radio anduti AM and a collective agreement between the Association of Journalistic Organizations of Paraguay and the SPP have been registered, which shows that collective bargaining exists in the country. The Government points out that most press workers are members of SITRAPREN, SPP and the Association of Graphic Reporters of Paraguay, which demonstrates that there is freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Government further emphasizes that collective bargaining and the content of a collective agreement on terms and conditions of employment are based on the wishes of the parties (employers and workers), in accordance with the provisions of Article  of ILO Convention No.  and article  of the Labour Code.
.The Government then submits the observations of enterprise A, which state that: (i) the MTESS has inspection processes regulated by the regulations in force, thereby ensuring transparency and efficiency in the supervision of enterprises in compliance with labour rights; (ii) the Committee has concluded on several occasions that Paraguayan labour laws provided for advanced protection and sufficiently promote the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining; and (iii) while collective bargaining is a fundamental right, the guiding principle of the ILO Conventions is free and voluntary collective bargaining, which cannot be imposed by any of the parties.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainants allege that two enterprises refuse to comply with the MTESS decisions of  and  setting minimum wages for workers in the newspaper graphics sector and that one of the enterprises in the sector refuses to sign a collective agreement on terms and conditions of employment.
.With regard to the alleged non-compliance with ministerial decisions on wages, the Committee recalls that its mandate consists in determining whether any given legislation or practice complies with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining laid down in the relevant Conventions [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Noting that the allegation in question relates only to the alleged non-compliance with provisions adopted by the Executive to set minimum wages in a sector of activity and that it does not raise issues relating to freedom of association, the Committee will not proceed to examine these allegations.
.As regards the allegation that SITRAPREN had been negotiating with enterprise A for years, but that the latter had not agreed to sign the collective agreement on terms and conditions of employment, the Committee notes that both the Government and enterprise A refer to the free and voluntary nature of collective bargaining. The Committee recalls that the voluntary negotiation of collective agreements, and therefore the autonomy of the bargaining partners, is a fundamental aspect of the principles of freedom of association [see Compilation, para. ]. Noting, moreover, that the Government refers to some examples of collective agreements on terms and conditions of employment between other trade union organizations and enterprises in the sector, and recalling that measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements [see Compilation, paras  and ], the Committee encourages the Government to do everything in its power to promote collective bargaining between the parties.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Recalling that measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements, the Committee encourages the Government to do everything in its power to promote collective bargaining between the parties; and(b) The Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination and is closed.",0,2018,Paraguay
1,".The complaint is contained in two communications from the Authentic Central Confederation of Workers (CUT-A) dated  May and  September .
.The Government sent its reply in a communication dated  October .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  May , the complainant organizations indicate that on  June , two days after the Union of Drivers and Employees of the La Limpea Transport Company was established,  members of the union were dismissed from the company on anti-union grounds and the administrative authority refused to register the union, acting in favour of the company owner, Mr Celso Maldonado, a member of the Paraguayan Parliament.
.The complainant organizations explain that because of their poor working conditions the transport company workers agreed on  June  to convene a general assembly to establish a trade union. The assembly took place on  June  with the attendance of  workers, the trade union was established, its constitution was adopted and its executive committee elected. The complainants indicate that on the day of the general constituent assembly, the union s executive committee sent a telegram to the company management informing them accordingly. However, the latter allegedly failed to acknowledge receipt of the telegram until  June .
.The complainant organizations allege that on  June , two days after the general constituent assembly, the company dismissed the trade unionists with the sole objective of depriving the union of the requisite minimum of  members, as stipulated by section  of the Labour Code. The complainants indicate that: (i) ten trade unionists, including union leaders, were dismissed without a valid reason by the company,  union members were dismissed for dereliction of duty, three had their employment contracts suspended, five reportedly resigned from the union and the company claimed that three members were not its employees; (ii) on  August , the company submitted a request to make payments on deposit for the ten union members dismissed without a valid reason, since the latter allegedly declined the proposed severance pay, and it filed an action to justify the grounds for dismissal against Mr Julio Osvaldo Maisana, Mr Antonio Jara, Mr Rafael Andino Bogado and another  members for unjustified mass dereliction of duty; (iii)  workers filed complaints against the company for dismissal; and (iv) in response to the anti-union dismissals that took place on  June  and in view of the unwillingness of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security to approve the registration of the union,  union members, including the general secretary and the records secretary, decided to hold a crucifixion protest opposite the ministry building.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the Ministry of Labour convened a round table for settling the dispute between the company and the trade union. The documentation sent by the complainants shows that: (i) the representatives of the company did not attend the first meeting on  July ; (ii) at the second meeting, on  July , the company representative said that the situation of the first ten dismissed workers was non-negotiable but indicated the possibility of dialogue regarding the other dismissed trade unionists; (iii) during the meeting of  August , the signature of the president of the Paraguayan Transport Workers' Federation was allegedly forged, whereupon the president filed a complaint with the Public Prosecutor s Office.
.According to the complainant organizations, the action of the Ministry of Labour was politically motivated. They indicate that: (i) on  July , the company asked the Ministry to reject the application for provisional registration of the trade union on the grounds that the minimum number of members had not been attained; (ii) on  July , the Legal Advice Department at the Ministry of Labour stated in opinion No. / that in order to obtain provisional registration the union needed to rectify some defects in terms of form, attach a copy of the record of the constituent assembly and amend the union s constitution, although the opinion did not include the objection made by the company; (iii) on  August , the union responded to the objections made by the company and the Legal Advice Department regarding its provisional registration; these communications show that the union considers that it met all the formal legal requirements, it denies that it failed to inform the company management of the establishment of the union until  June  or that it admitted individuals from outside the company as members of the union; (iv) on  September , the Legal Advice Department issued opinion No. / indicating that the union had still not fully met all the requirements referred to previously and again asked the union to send the original and a certified copy of the act of constitution, to send information on the members who attended, and to communicate the balance of the social funds; (v) on  September, the trade union sent the information requested in opinion No. / but indicated with regard to the certified copy of the act of constitution that the general secretary, Mr Miguel Garcete, and the records secretary, Mr Esteban lvarez, were not in a position to provide signatures since both were participating in the crucifixion protest, and so authorization was given through the signatures of other members of the executive committee; (vi) on  October , the Legal Advice Department indicated once again that Mr Miguel Garcete and Mr Esteban lvarez, in their respective capacities as general secretary and records secretary, had to comply with section (a) of the Labour Code, and that to date they had not signed the certified copy of the act of constitution,  other persons having done so instead of them, without having explicit authorization to sign such documents'  (vii) on  October , in a communication to the Labour Director-General, the union attached, in compliance with the abovementioned opinion issued in October, the certified copy of the act of constitution, and also the notarial act of confirmation and authorization of the general secretary and the records secretary, indicating that the latter  were unable to sign any required documents since their hands were nailed'  and authorizing the finance secretary, the legal affairs secretary and the disputes secretary to sign all necessary documents; (viii) on  November , the Ministry of Labour, by decision No. , provisionally registered the union and gave the union  days to validate all the legal measures adopted prior to this date; (ix) on  December , the general secretary and the records secretary, since they were no longer incapacitated, validated their previous measures; (x) on  December , the company once again objected and called for the definitive registration of the union to be refused; and (xi) on  May , the Ministry of Labour issued decision No.  setting forth the objections made against the definitive registration of the trade union, stating that  it was not valid to argue that at the time of the constituent assembly the dismissed individuals were workers of the company; rather, what was relevant was to determine the number of members remaining in the union further to the dismissals for various reasons'  The union appealed against this decision, calling for it to be declared null and void.
.The complainant organizations emphasize that the Ministry of Labour filed an appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) against  members of the trade union, since its members had set up tents opposite the Ministry and a number of them had engaged in a crucifixion protest, thereby causing a breach of the peace and disrupting public services. The information sent by the complainants shows that on  November  the Court of First Instance dismissed the amparo appeal, that decision was appealed against by the Ministry, and on  February  the Agreements Division of the First Chamber of the Criminal Appeals Court in turn dismissed the Ministry s appeal.
.The complainant organizations allege that, in the context of a bidding process for the operation of route , the successful company refused for anti-union reasons to re-engage the workers of the Julio Correa Transport Company (the original licensed operator) and they denounce the lack of action by the Government in this respect.
.The complainant organizations explain that transport companies operate on the basis of government licences, and so the public transport service is provided through private operators. They emphasize that the original licensed operator had an established, active trade union, namely the Union of Drivers and Employees of the Julio Correa Transport Company. In October , the Office of the Deputy Transport Minister launched a public bidding process for the provision of passenger transport services on route . Two companies submitted bids but one then withdrew, leaving the San Isidro Company (the new licensed operator) as the only bidder. According to the complainants, the licence for the route was awarded on",0,2016,Paraguay
2,"condition that the successful company would hire all the drivers and workers employed by the original licensed operator. However, on  January , at a meeting between the union leaders, the original operator and the new operator, the trade union was informed of a public instrument which stated that the employees of the original operator  approved and endorsed' the hiring of  per cent of the workers.
.The appendices and the allegations sent by the complainant organizations show that: (i) on  January , the Deputy Labour Minister, in the context of the process to re-engage the former employees of the original licensed operator, requested the designation of representatives of the former employees to participate in the employer changeover process; (ii) on  January , the trade union sent a list of representatives; (iii) on  February , during a meeting with the Ministry of Labour, the Office of the Deputy Transport Minister and the management of the new licensed operator, the union gained access to the public instrument which legitimized the engagement of  per cent of the former employees and discovered its content to be fake; (iv) in February , the union sent two requests to the Ministry of Labour and the Office of the Deputy Transport Minister to expedite procedures to enable it to become part of the committee on the re-engagement of former employees of the Julio Correa Transport Company; (v) on  February , the union submitted a request for mediation under file No. / to the Ombudsman s Office; (vi) on  March , the Deputy Labour Minister, Mr Cesar Agusto Sagovia, informed the union, in reply to the requests to expedite procedures, that no union representative or former employee had participated in designing the re-engagement process or come forward during the -day employer changeover period; (vii) on  March , Mr Miguel Rojas, the union s general secretary, and Mr Remigio Segovia, the disputes secretary, filed a criminal complaint regarding the alleged faking of the document; and (viii) on  April , the union filed an amparo appeal against the company calling for the re-engagement and reinstatement of  former workers. The complainants emphasize that, to date, the new operator has not hired any workers previously employed by the original operator, and they consider this to constitute a violation of freedom of association.
.In its communication of  October , the Government forwarded the information supplied by the Labour Directorate, in which the latter denies the allegations of the complainant organizations concerning the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register or recognize the trade union. The Government indicates that, by decision No.  of  November , the Ministry provisionally registered the union in accordance with the procedure established in section  of the Labour Code, the company made objections to this registration, and decision No.  was issued on  May , setting out the objections to the provisional registration of the union.
.The Government indicates that the trade union appealed against the decision of the Ministry of Labour and that the case file was referred to the judiciary for processing. On  November , the Labour Appeal Court declared null and void the procedural measures on which the appeal filed on  July  was based, and also declared the appeal filed by the union to be null and void. Subsequently, on  August , the Supreme Court of Justice rejected the union s action to have the decision of the Labour Appeal Court declared unconstitutional, on the grounds that there was no indication of the alleged arbitrariness, that no specific infringement of constitutional provisions had been demonstrated, and no violation of the right of defence or due process had occurred.
.Furthermore, the Government sent note No. / of the register of employers and workers dated  March , indicating that the company was registered until . The Government rejects the allegation of lack of action to settle the dispute. Specifically, it indicates that the Collective Disputes Mediation Department attached to the Ministry of Labour convened two tripartite meetings for the purpose of addressing the situation of the transport company workers.
.Moreover, the Government forwarded the company s reply indicating that the union had been recognized only provisionally, and that subsequently the company had made objections because it considered that there had been irregularities in the establishment of the union, thereby contravening the provisions of the Labour Code, and that it did not have a sufficient number of members.
.As regards the crucifixion protests held opposite the premises of the Ministry of Labour, the Government indicates that this type of demonstration does not involve the features of crucifixion associated with the Greek and Latin terms, that the state of health of the demonstrators was continuously monitored by doctors from the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, and that the photos sent by the Government at the time of making a statement before the competent judge show the good physical condition of the demonstrators.
.In its communication of  October , the Government forwarded information provided by the Ministry of Labour, indicating that the last registered executive committee of the union dates from  March , and sent the report of the Department for the Register of Employers and Workers, which shows that the original licensed operator submitted lists of employees up to .
.The Government sent the reply of the new licensed operator referring to the court s decision regarding the amparo appeal filed by the union. The new operator indicates that it can be seen from the copy of the amparo documentation that this case involves the new operator winning a public bidding process, that the workers employed by the original operator asked to be re-engaged by the successful company and that, through public instrument No. //, the successful company undertook to incorporate  per cent of these drivers and employees in its workforce. However, no employee came forward during the  day employer changeover period to undertake the necessary registration for the process of re-engagement of the former employees.
.Furthermore, the Government attached a copy of the amparo appeal filed by the trade union, which was declared inadmissible on  August  on the grounds that the issue of the legitimacy of the public instrument was not a matter for the amparo proceedings, that another appropriate channel existed, that there had been no urgency, and that administrative and judicial procedures had not been exhausted. Subsequently, the trade union filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal for Children and Young Persons, and this was dismissed on  March .
.As regards the current situation of the original licensed operator, the Government states that the aforementioned company was shut down by the board of the now defunct Secretariat of Transport of the Metropolitan Area of Asuncin and has ceased to operate the route concerned since , when the bidding process was completed and the operation of the route was awarded to a different company.
.In conclusion and with respect to both cases, the Government considers that there are no violations of the right of freedom of association, and that the State of Paraguay promotes the full exercise of freedom of association since this principle constitutes a fundamental element of the democratic system.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations report the mass dismissal of trade unionists at a public transport company on account of the establishment of the trade union and the unjustified refusal by the labour administrative authority to grant definitive registration to the union.
.The Committee observes that in its communication of  September  the complainant organizations allege that: (i) the workers of the transport company were invited to attend a general constituent assembly on  June  during which it was voted to establish a trade union; (ii) the executive committee of the union informed the company the same day that the union had been established but the company did not formally acknowledge receipt of this communication until  June ; (iii) on  June , the transport company workers, all of whom were union members, were dismissed; (iv) as regards the provisional registration of the union, on  July  the company called for the registration to be rejected, and from  July to  October  the Legal Advice Department at the Ministry of Labour refused to process the registration of the trade union because of formal defects, which did not include the company s objection regarding membership, and which were reportedly rectified by the union; (v) the Ministry of Labour filed an amparo appeal against the members of the union because the union members had decided to hold a demonstration opposite the ministry premises; (vi) on  November , the Ministry granted provisional registration to the union subject to the validation of all previously taken legal measures, which was effected by the executive committee on  December ; (vii) on  December , the company once again called for the definitive registration of the union to be refused; and (viii) on  May ,",1,2016,Paraguay
3,"the Labour Director-General rejected the union s application for definitive registration and rescinded its registration on the grounds that the employment of  of the  founding members of the union had been terminated through resignations or dismissals.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations also formulate various allegations of dismissal of trade union leaders and members on anti-union grounds. The Committee emphasizes that, according to the complainants, ten members of the executive committee were dismissed without a valid reason and  other workers were dismissed for mass dereliction of duty. In addition, the Committee note the complainants' allegations indicating that the Ministry of Labour failed to act impartially, refusing to register the union with an objection to mere defects of form, and thereby favouring the owner of the company, who is a member of Parliament.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes the Government s reply indicating that the Ministry of Labour at no time refused to recognize the trade union. As regards the Ministry s decision regarding the definitive registration of the union, the Government indicates that the union appealed against this decision and that on  November  the Labour Appeals Court declared the union s appeal inadmissible. Furthermore, it notes the Government s reply denying the alleged lack of action by the Collective Disputes Mediation Department, given that the Ministry convened tripartite meetings with a view to settling the dispute. Lastly, the Committee notes the company s allegations, forwarded by the Government, indicating that there had been irregularities in the establishment of the union, involving persons from outside the company and an insufficient number of members.
.As regards the refusal to register the trade union, the Committee observes that on  November  the Ministry of Labour granted provisional registration to the trade union ' without taking account of the company s allegation that there was an insufficient number of members and hence without highlighting this as a requirement that needed to be met ' but that the registration was subsequently rescinded by a decision of the same administrative authority of  May  on the grounds of failing to meet the requirement of  workers laid down in section  of the Labour Code. In this respect, the Committee considers that a minimum of  members to form a union does not seem excessive in this case. The Committee also observes that, according to the supporting documentation supplied by the complainant organizations, the union maintained an ongoing correspondence with the competent authorities and rectified all the defects of form which had been pointed out. The Committee observes that in decision No.  the administrative authority rejected the union s application for registration on the basis that the criterion for determining the number of union members at the company was not the number of members at the time of the constituent assembly but the number of members remaining in the union after the terminations of employment for various reasons. The Committee observes that over ten months elapsed between the date of establishment of the union ( June ) and the date of the administrative authority s decision concerning the definitive registration of the union ( May ). In this regard, the Committee recalls that a long registration procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the establishment of organizations and amounts to a denial of the right of workers to establish organizations without previous authorization [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ].
.As regards the dismissal of trade union leaders, the Committee notes that some  trade unionists in total ' including at least  members of the executive committee ' were dismissed two days after the constituent assembly was held. The Committee recalls that especially at the initial stages of unionization in a workplace, dismissal of trade union representatives might fatally compromise incipient attempts at exercising the right to organize, as it not only deprives the workers of their representatives, but also has an intimidating effect on other workers who could have envisaged assuming trade union functions or simply joining the union [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. While noting with regret that neither the complainant organizations nor the Government have provided detailed information on the labour grievances submitted by the dismissed workers and the outcome thereof, the Committee recalls that where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ].
.Since it is unable to rule out the possibility that the delay in proceedings may have had a negative impact on the possibility of meeting the membership requirement (with a number of resignations having occurred in this space of time, further to the alleged acts of anti-union discrimination) and of securing the registration of the union and also on the enjoyment of trade union immunity by the executive committee, and observing that: (i) in its initial examination of the application for registration the authorities did not take account of the company s objection with regard to attaining the minimum number of members; they did not include it in the list of issues to be resolved but referred to it subsequently in order to refuse registration; (ii) the reduction in the union s membership was due to the dismissal of a large number of its members a few days after the constituent assembly; and (iii) since the Committee has no knowledge of whether the alleged anti-union motives for these dismissals were investigated, it requests the Government to keep it informed of any administrative or judicial proceedings in progress and to send copies of any decisions. Lastly, in view of the seriousness of the allegations of acts of anti-union discrimination carried out in the days following the establishment of the union, the Committee recalls that in cases of the dismissal of trade unionists on the grounds of their trade union membership or activities, the Committee has requested the Government to take the necessary measures to enable trade union leaders and members who had been dismissed due to their legitimate trade union activities to secure reinstatement in their jobs and to ensure the application against the enterprises concerned of the corresponding legal sanctions [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation into these acts and to take the appropriate measures in consequence. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Lastly, the Committee recalls that for many years the Committee of Experts has been observing the need to strengthen the legal provisions against anti-union discrimination, the lack of appropriate penalties for non-observance of the provisions concerning trade union immunity and interference in relation to workers' organizations, and that the Committee of Experts asked the Government in the context of Case No.  to hold consultations with the social partners concerning the establishment of mechanisms to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, including rapid and impartial procedures, with provision for appeals and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions. The Committee hopes that the Government will send its observations on this matter without delay as part of the follow-up to Case No. .
.The Committee observes that in the present complaint the complainant organizations report that in the context of a bidding process the successful company refused to re-engage the employees of the original licensed operator on allegedly anti-union grounds and denounce the lack of action by the competent authorities in this respect.
.The Committee notes the allegations of the complainant organizations indicating that: (i) in October , when the Office of the Deputy Transport Minister launched a bidding process for the operation of bus route , one of the conditions of the bidding process was reportedly that that the new licensed operator would give an undertaking to hire all the workers previously employed by the original licensed operator; (ii) during a meeting between the company that won the contract, the Ministry of Labour, the Office of the Deputy Transport Minister and the trade union, the latter was informed of the existence of a document allegedly agreed upon by the former employees approving the re-engagement of  per cent of the workers and decided to file a criminal complaint regarding the alleged faking of the document; (iii) on  January , the Deputy Labour Minister, in the context of the process to re-engage the former employees, requested the designation of representatives of the former employees to participate in the employer changeover process, and the trade union sent its list; (iv) the union sent two requests to the Ministry of Labour and the Office of the Deputy Transport Minister to expedite procedures to enable it to become part of the committee on the re-engagement of former employees of the original licensed company; and (v) on  March , the Deputy Labour Minister informed the union, in reply to the requests to expedite procedures, that no union representatives had participated formally in the re-engagement process and no former employee had come forward during the",1,2016,Paraguay
4,"-day employer changeover period.
.The Committee also notes the Government s observations indicating that: (i) the new licensed operator won the public bidding process, the employees of the original licensed operator then asked to be re-engaged by the successful company and, through public instrument No. //, the successful company undertook to incorporate  per cent of these drivers and employees in its workforce; (ii) no workers or union members came forward during the -day employer changeover period to undertake the necessary registration for the process of re-engagement of the former employees; (iii) the amparo appeal filed by the trade union in relation to the supposed forgery of signatures was dismissed by the competent authority in view of the existence of other appropriate channels; and (iv) the original licensed company was shut down and ceased to operate the route concerned as from , when the bidding process was completed and the operation of the route was awarded to a different company.
.While noting the different versions relating to failure to re-engage the workers by the company that was successful in the bidding process, the Committee recalls that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee also considers that the liquidation of a company and the fact that the legal person under which the company operated has ceased to exist should not be used as a pretext for anti-union discrimination nor should they be an obstacle to the competent authorities determining whether or not there were acts of anti-union discrimination and, if such practices are shown to have taken place, to sanctioning such illegal acts and ensuring that the affected workers are duly compensated [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ].
.Recalling that where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ], with a view to determining whether or not there was anti-union discrimination in the reported occurrences, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to conduct an investigation without delay into the allegations of failure to re-engage the employees of the original licensed operator on anti-union grounds. Moreover, the Committee invites the complainant organizations, with a view to facilitating the investigation, to send the Government information on the allegedly anti union nature of the reported occurrences. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	As regards the allegations concerning the refusal to register the Union of Drivers and Employees of the La Limpea Transport Company and the alleged anti-union dismissals, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any administrative or judicial proceedings in progress and to send copies of any decisions. In view of the seriousness of the allegations of acts of anti-union discrimination carried out in the days following the establishment of the union, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation into these acts in accordance with its conclusions in this regard and to take the appropriate measures in consequence. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b)	As regards the allegations of anti-union discrimination against the Union of Drivers and Employees of the Julio Correa Transport Company, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to conduct an investigation without delay into the allegations of failure to re-engage the employees of the original licensed operator on anti-union grounds. Moreover, the Committee invites the complainant organizations, with a view to facilitating the investigation, to send the Government information on the allegedly anti-union nature of the reported occurrences. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",1,2016,Paraguay
5,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  from the United Workers' Federation (Authentic) (CUT-A), the National Workers' Union of Yacyret (SINATRAY), the Paraguayan Workers' Union of Yacyret ' Technical Department (SITPAY-DT), the Union of Officials (Authentic) of the Yacyret Binational Entity ' Paraguayan Sector (SIFEBY-A) and the Union of Safety and Information Sector Officials of the Yacyret Binational Entity (SIFUSEBY).
.The Government sent its partial observations in communications dated  May ,  February and  March .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  June , the complainant organizations allege that, since its establishment in , the Argentine-Paraguayan Yacyret electrical power plant (hereinafter: binational entity) has not concluded any collective agreement on conditions of work with the trade unions, despite having an obligation to do so under the terms of section  of the Paraguayan Labour Code, which provides that:  Any enterprise that employs  or more workers shall have the obligation to conclude a collective agreement on conditions of work. The general conditions shall be negotiated with any organized trade union that exists there'  The complainants also allege that although the management of the binational entity, by Decision No.  of  April , awarded a  per cent wage increase to workers in the Argentine sector, workers in the Paraguayan sector were granted a  per cent wage increase, which was never implemented in practice. They also allege that although the management, by Decision No.  of  April , granted the payment of special ex gratia compensation to workers in both sectors, the binational entity has refused to implement the terms of the decision for workers in the Paraguayan sector.
.The complainant organizations indicate that although two tripartite meetings were held with the labour administrative authority on  and  June , the binational entity refused to examine the grievances on the grounds that they were the subject of legal proceedings and that, instead of accepting the claims, it decided by a decision of  December  to make Decision No.  null and void, thus depriving the workers in both the Paraguayan and Argentine sectors of the wage increase which had been awarded. According to the complainants, it was because of these circumstances and the binational entity s refusal to engage in collective bargaining that they informed the management on  January  that a strike would be held from  February  for  days in support of the call for a collective agreement on conditions of work and for payment of the wage increase and the special ex gratia compensation.
.According to the complainants, on  February , and as a result of mediation by the governor of the department of Misiones, it was agreed to end the strike (which had been under way since  February) and to set up a dialogue round table. On  and  February , a series of agreements were signed by the binational entity and the complainant organizations, in which the management of the binational entity agreed, inter alia, to begin negotiations for a collective agreement on conditions of work. The complainants object that these agreements were never implemented and that, on the contrary, workers were transferred or dismissed as a result of the strike. The complainants also allege that the labour administrative authority also conducted reprisals against them, by not recording and validating the unions' documents for registration of their new executive committees.
.In its communications of  May ,  February and  March , the Government sends its observations and the binational entity s reply. The Government indicates that the binational entity is an undertaking which was established under a treaty signed by the Republic of Paraguay and the Argentine Republic on  December  and is governed by the provisions of the treaty and its annexes and that, with regard to labour matters, is governed by the  labour and social security protocol' adopted in Paraguay through Act No.  of  November . The Government states that the issue of the signature of a collective agreement on conditions of work was the subject of a labour court action brought by several employee unions at the binational entity, under the title Union of professional officials of the Yacyret Binational Entity et al v Yacyret Binational Entity re obligation to conclude collective agreement on conditions of work. In this regard, the Government states that, although the First-Instance Civil and Labour Court (First Rota) of the Capital, Secretariat No. , decided in a ruling of  October  to accept the complaint filed by the trade unions with the award of costs and ordered the enterprise to conclude and sign a collective agreement on conditions of work within  days, the Labour Appeals Court of the Capital (Second Chamber), in Judgment No.  dated  August , overturned the first-instance ruling (the Government has provided the text of the said rulings).
.With respect to the dismissals allegedly made as a result of the strike held from  to  February , the Government indicates that these were due to the fact that many working projects had finalized and that all dismissals were done in accordance with the Labour Code and the entity s internal regulations.
.As regards Decision No.  of April , whereby a wage increase was agreed, the binational entity indicates that this was made null and void in December  because the increase had been awarded on account of the situation of high inflation in Argentina, which directly affected the purchasing power of officials in the Argentine sector, an issue which, in any case, is being examined by the courts. The binational entity emphasizes the validity of Decision No.  of  April , providing for the payment of special ex gratia compensation, with due and effective implementation without discrimination in both sectors and an extension of its application until  by Executive Board Decisions Nos / and /.
.According to the binational entity, the tripartite meeting convened by the Labour Directorate-General on  June  was not successful because the trade unions had filed a judicial complaint prior to the meeting and since this was still pending, the substantive issue had first to be elucidated by the judicial authorities. As regards the second tripartite meeting convened for  August  at the request of the complainants, the Collective Dispute Mediation Department indicated in a note to the binational entity that it had not taken place because of lack of interest on the part of the plaintiff.
.The Government also affirms that the processes for registration of the union executive committees have not been obstructed and that, as revealed by a note drawn up on  August  by the Technical Office of the Collective Relations and Union Registration Department at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (attached by the Government), the executive committees of the following unions, inter alia, at the binational entity were registered: SINATRAY (latest executive committee as from  May ), SITPAY-DT (latest executive committee as from  August ), SIFEBY-A (latest executive committee as from  July ) and SIFUSEBY (latest executive committee as from  August ).
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations in the present case allege that a binational electrical power plant (hereinafter: binational entity) established more than  years ago has not negotiated any collective agreement on conditions of work. The complainants also allege that workers were dismissed or transferred following a strike held from  to  February  and that the labour administrative authority conducted reprisals against the above-mentioned organizations by not recording or validating the documents for registration of their new executive committees.
.With regard to collective bargaining, the Committee notes the complainants' allegations that: (i) ever since it was established, the binational entity has not negotiated a single collective agreement on conditions of work, despite its obligation to do so under section  of the Paraguayan Labour Code; (ii) a strike was held from  to  February  in support, inter alia, of the call for a collective agreement on conditions of work; and (iii) on  February , in the context of a dialogue round table set up after the end of the strike, the management of the binational entity signed an agreement with the complainants in which, inter alia, an undertaking was given to start negotiations for a collective agreement on conditions of work but an agreement was never adopted. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s indications that: (i) with regard to labour matters, the binational entity is governed by the  labour and social security protocol' adopted in Paraguay through Act No.  of  November  (the Committee has noted that, under section  of the protocol, the trade union rights of workers at the binational entity are determined by the laws of the country",0,2015,Paraguay
6,"in which the workers are hired); and (ii) the issue of the adoption of the collective agreement on conditions of work was the subject of a labour court action brought by several employee unions at the binational entity, with the title Union of professional officials of the Yacyret Binational Entity et al v Yacyret Binational Entity re obligation to conclude collective agreement on conditions of work, and although in a ruling issued on  October , the First-Instance Civil and Labour Court (First Rota) of the Capital, Secretariat No. , accepted the complaint filed by the trade unions and ordered the enterprise to conclude and sign a collective agreement on conditions of work within  days, the Labour Appeals Court of the Capital (Second Chamber), in Judgment No.  of  August , overturned the first-instance ruling.
.The Committee observes that the allegation relating to the absence of collective bargaining at the binational entity was examined recently by the Committee in the context of another case concerning that entity. On that occasion, the Committee recalled that measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements, and it asked the Government to take the necessary steps to promote collective negotiation in good faith within the binational entity on conditions of work [see Case No. , th Report, June , paras ' ]. Furthermore, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, in  the Appeals Court overturned a first-instance ruling which obliged the enterprise to conclude and sign a collective agreement on conditions of work within  days. The Committee notes that the Government has provided the text of the said rulings and observes that in its conclusions, the Appeals Court emphasized that at issue was not a collective agreement fully agreed by the parties and ready for signature, but rather a draft collective agreement which still needed to be examined and approved by the entity s competent authorities. The Appeals Court also stressed that, as set out in the entity s internal regulations, any decision that would create an obligation to the entity had to be taken by both directors and not only by one of them (in the present case only one of the two directors had been involved in the negotiation of the draft collective agreement). The Appeals Court concluded that the entity was therefore not obliged to sign the draft collective agreement and that the draft could only be binding to the entity after having been accepted and approved by it. The Committee takes due note of the said ruling and, recalling that it is following up this issue in Case No. , invites the Government to examine, within the framework of the entity s regulations, the conditions under which collective bargaining can be fully exercised.
.With respect to the dismissals allegedly made as a result of the strike held from  to  February , the Committee notes the Government s indication that these were due to the fact that many projects had been finalized and that all dismissals were done in accordance with the Labour Code and the entity s internal regulations. The Committee also observes that the complainants do not identify any particular worker who was supposedly dismissed as a result of the strike. Although the complainants attached a letter dated  March  signed by the legal adviser of the binational entity indicating that the dismissal of Mr Alberto Andrs Bernal Ruz was due to policies implemented by the binational entity as part of a human resources optimization programme, there is no indication in this letter or in any other attached document of the date when the worker was dismissed or whether the dismissal was due to his trade union activities or his participation in the strike. Nor do the complainants indicate whether any judicial appeal was made against the dismissal. Under these circumstances, and in in the absence of substantial information on the dismissals, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations but invites the Government to engage with the social partners concerned with a view to ensuring that they were not based on anti-union motives.
.The Committee observes that the Government has not sent its observations concerning the transfers allegedly made as a result of the strike held from  to  February . The Committee also observes that the complainants do not identify any particular worker who was supposedly transferred as a result of the strike. The Committee observes that the documents attached by the complainants show that: (i) on  January , the trade unions sent a letter to the management of the binational entity informing it of the decision to hold a -day strike from  February; (ii) by Decision No.  of  January , the director of the binational entity ordered the transfer of six officials who would remain available to the human resources sector; and (iii) in the agreement concluded on  February  between the complainants and the binational entity, in the context of a dialogue round table set up after the end of the strike, the binational entity undertook to review the transfer of one of the workers, Mr Ramn Rodrguez, and indicated that the other officials who had been transferred were the subject of an administrative investigation. The Committee invites the Government to engage with the social partners concerned with a view to ensuring that these transfers were not based on anti-union motives.
.Lastly, as regards the allegation that the labour administrative authority conducted reprisals against the complainants, by not recording or validating the documents for registration of the new executive committees, the Committee notes that, as shown by a note dated  December  from the Technical Office of the Collective Relations and Union Registration Department at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (attached by the Government), the executive committees of the following complainant unions were registered as follows: SINATRAY (latest executive committee as from  May ), SITPAY-DT (latest executive committee as from  August ), SIFEBY-A (latest executive committee as from  July ) and SIFUSEBY (latest executive committee as from  August ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Recalling that the Committee is following up on the issue of collective bargaining in this specific context in Case No. , it invites the Government to examine, within the framework of the entity s regulations, the conditions under which collective bargaining can be fully exercised.(b)	The Committee invites the Government to engage with the social partners concerned with a view to ensuring that the dismissals and transfers referred to in this case were not based on anti-union motives.",1,2015,Paraguay
7,".The Committee last examined this case, which concerns allegations of various anti-union acts against officers and members of the Union of Professionals and Technicians of the National Institute of Technology, Standardization and Metrology (INTN Sindical), at its meeting in June  [see nd Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee invited the complainant organization, if it so wished, to provide the competent authorities with additional detailed information at its disposal to enable them to investigate any remaining allegations of anti-union discrimination and, if found to have been made, to impose appropriate sanctions and compensatory measures, and requested the Government and the complainant organization to keep it informed in this respect, as well as on the outcome of the appeal lodged by Mr Mario Leiva. The Committee also encouraged the Government to promote collective bargaining so that in the near future a collective agreement could be concluded with the Institute.
.With regard to the outcome of the appeal lodged by Mr Mario Leiva, the Government, by a communication dated  March , stated that Mr Mario Leiva was reinstated by Resolution INTN No. /, dated  September , and by Agreement and Ruling No.  dated  October , issued by the Second Chamber of the Court of Auditors, as an official of the INTN and that, at the time of preparation of the aforementioned communication, he was performing his duties as a permanent official of the INTN.
.With regard to the promotion of collective bargaining within the INTN, the Government stated that the Directorate General of Labour had found that, according to the documents in the Trade Union Registration Department, the following INTN trade unions were registered, namely: (i) the INTN trade union, with trade union status granted on  March ; (ii) the Union of Officials of the National Institute of Technology and Standardization (SIFUINTN), with trade union status granted on  September ; (iii) the Sindicato de Trabajadores Pblicos del INTN (SITRAPUINTN), with trade union status granted on  August ; and (iv) the workers organization, Union of Workers of the National Institute of Technology and Standardization (FINTNSI), with trade union status granted on  August . Furthermore, the Government reported the existence of a collective agreement on working conditions between the INTN and the SIFUINTN trade union, approved and registered on  September , from which strict respect for freedom of association can be inferred.
.The Committee takes note of the detailed information provided by the Government concerning the reinstatement of Mr Mario Leiva. The Committee also takes note of the information provided by the Government concerning the existence of a collective agreement on working conditions signed between the INTN and SIFUINTN, approved on  September , this union being one of the four registered with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MTESS) and having trade union status. On the basis of the above and having received no further information in this respect from the complainant organization, the Committee, while encouraging the Government to take all necessary measures to promote the use of collective bargaining within the INTN, considers this case closed and will not pursue with further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  March  from the Single Confederation of Workers (CCT).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  March , the CCT alleges that the National Institute of Technology, Standardization and Meteorology s Union of Professionals and Technicians (INTN Sindical) has been subjected to anti-union harassment.
.The complainant reports that INTN Sindical was harassed by one of the general directors of the National Institute of Technology, Standardization and Meteorology (hereinafter  the Institute'  during his two terms of office (July to December  and  August  to the date on which the complaint was presented, respectively) through: (a) a campaign, launched in July , that led to the withdrawal of over half of the union s members (a fact that was reported to the General Director of the Institute and to the Ministry of Justice and Labour); (b) two requests for revocation of INTN Sindical s registration, made by the General Director of the Institute (the General Director for Labour decided not to grant the revocation request but the Institute persisted with a second request); (c) dismissal of three members of INTN Sindical who enjoyed security of tenure (Ms Delia Ros, Ms Silvia Vidal and Ms Elba Ramrez) without an administrative investigation; (d) during the General Director s first term of office, intimidation of the trade union s general secretary, who was summoned to a meeting at which an attorney from the Institute s legal office threatened him with dismissal unless he withdrew from the union; (e) violation of the right to freedom of expression through a decision (No. /) requiring the General Directorate s express approval of trade union announcements and notices and imposing other conditions (the content must be of trade union or general interest and may not include insults and incitement that impugn the integrity of individuals or foment hatred on the part of public servants; and (f) harassment of other members of the union through transfers and other anti-union measures: (i) the Deputy General Secretary, Ms Nancy Melgarejo, was transferred twice with no regard for her profile; (ii) the union s spokesperson, Ms Carmen Mallorqun, was transferred twice (first to an isolated, unsafe and unclean office and then with a demotion) and dismissal proceedings (subsequently dropped) were brought against her; (iii) the current General Secretary of the union, Ms Delfina de Franco, was demoted and threatened with dismissal; (iv) dismissal proceedings were brought against the organization s Secretary, Mr Mario Leiva, on three occasions (the proceedings were dropped on two occasions and on the third, which ended in dismissal, they were procedurally flawed); (v) the union s Deputy Communications Secretary, Ms Trini Jimenez, received a two-step demotion, dismissal procedures (subsequently dropped) were brought against her and she was relieved of some of her duties; (vi) the union s Finance Secretary, Ms Rita Rodrguez, was removed from her post, demoted, investigated and threatened with dismissal; (vii) Mr Miguel ngel Barrios was unfairly transferred for attempting to make management transparent; and (viii) Ms Susana Cabrera and Mr Ricardo Ramrez were demoted. During these periods, complaints of anti-union discrimination were brought before the congressional human rights committees and those of other institutions, such as the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Public Service Secretariat. The complainant also indicates that two tripartite meetings ' at which the union s representatives reiterated the complaints that they had brought before the labour administration, alleging anti-union harassment ' were requested and held and that no agreement with the employer was reached.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that the Institute s authorities are unwilling to grant the requests for the signing of a collective agreement made by INTN Sindical and two of the Institute s other unions.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government transmits the observations of the Institute and the General Labour Directorate in reply to the allegations contained in the complaint.
.The Institute makes the following arguments in its defence: (a) with regard to the alleged anti-union harassment by the General Director, who, during his first term of office, is said to have forced over half of the union s members to withdraw, the Institute states that after he was removed from office, the members who had withdrawn from the union did not re join it even though the supposed harasser had left his post (the Institute maintains that the complaint was, in fact, prompted by the fact that INTN Sindical s officers are public servants who formerly held senior posts in the Institute and were removed from their positions of trust); (b) with regard to the requests for revocation of the registration of INTN Sindical, the authorities merely requested verification of compliance with section  of the Labour Code, which establishes the minimum number of members, since they were aware that many members had withdrawn from the union and they had confirmed that INTN Sindical did not have the minimum number of members required; in that connection, the Institute states that it will request revocation of the registration of any union that does not meet the criteria established by law; (c) with regard to the alleged dismissal without an administrative investigation of two members of INTN Sindical who enjoyed security of tenure (Ms Delia Ros and Ms Silvia Vidal), the Institute states that they held positions of trust (Internal Auditor and Administrative and Financial Officer, respectively); therefore, pursuant to the Public Service Act, these posts were filled at the discretion of the highest authority (the Institute also emphasizes that: (i) these public servants had been seconded to the Institute; therefore, once dismissed, they went back to work at their original institutions; (ii) both women",-1,2015,Paraguay
8,"appealed before the Court of Auditors, which dismissed the appeal; and (iii) these public servants, who had been members of the previous administration, are attempting to discredit the current one); (d) with regard to the allegation that the transfer of several public servants (Ms Nancy Melgarejo, Ms Carmen Mallorqun, Ms Delfina de Franco, Mr Mario Leiva, Ms Trini Jimenez, Ms Rita Rodrguez, Mr Miguel ngel Barrios, Ms Susana Cabrera and Mr Ricardo Ramrez) constitutes anti-union harassment, the Institute indicates the transfers were carried out in full compliance with the law, which empowers the authority to assign new responsibilities to the Institute s employees; it also denies the complainant s allegation that there are isolated or unhealthy offices; (e) with regard to the administrative investigations opened, the Institute reports that they were prompted by reports of irregularities and that in each case, an inquiry was ordered in order to assign responsibility in accordance with the law (in the case of Mr Mario Leiva, the examining magistrate in the public prosecution service ordered his dismissal for serious misconduct; Mr Leiva appealed before the Court of Auditors and the proceedings are ongoing pending a final judgment); (f) with regard to the allegation of intimidation directed against the General Secretary of INTN Sindical, the Institute categorically denies that he was threatened and emphasizes that he has produced no evidence in support of his complaint; and (g) with regard to the allegation that Decision No. / constituted a violation of freedom of expression, the Institute indicates that the decision regulated the posting of announcements, notices and other documents on blackboards or notice boards and that there was no effort to restrict the right to freedom of expression, but only to ensure that communication was better organized.
.With respect to the complaint that the complainants brought before the human rights committees of the two chambers of Congress, the Institute states that its representatives participated in all of the meetings held and replied to all of the committees' questions regarding the complaints made by INTN Sindical. Furthermore, the Government states that there is no record showing that the complainants brought administrative proceedings concerning the complaint before the administrative labour authority.
.Lastly, the Institute categorically denies the allegation that it is unwilling to grant the request for the signing of a collective agreement and states that its General Directorate is more than willing to sign such an agreement since it would include benefits to be enjoyed by all of the Institute s employees. However, as this entails an extremely broad and sensitive document, (since each of its provisions would have to be brought into line with the legislation), the draft is still under consideration.
.The Committee notes that the complaint concerns allegations of anti-union discrimination (campaign by the Institute s authorities promoting the withdrawal of members of INTN Sindical and other acts of anti-union discrimination against its officers and members); requests for revocation of the union s registration; and refusal to bargain collectively.
.Concerning the allegations of anti-union discrimination, the Committee notes that: (a) with regard to the allegation that members of INTN Sindical who enjoyed security of tenure were dismissed without an administrative investigation, the Government indicates that the posts of two of the aforementioned public servants were positions of trust filled at the discretion of the authorities; that, once dismissed, they went back to work at their original institutions; and that the Court of Auditors dismissed their appeal; (b) with regard to the allegations of anti-union transfers, the Government indicates that they were carried out in full compliance with the law, which empowers the authority to assign new responsibilities to the Institute s employees; (c) the Government denies the allegation that the General Secretary of INTN Sindical was subjected to intimidation or threats and states that he has produced no evidence of such actions; (d) with regard to the administrative investigations opened, the Government indicates that they were prompted by reports of irregularities; that in each case, an inquiry was ordered in order to assign responsibility; and that, in the case of Mr Mario Leiva, the examining magistrate in the public prosecution service ordered his dismissal for serious misconduct; Mr Leiva appealed before the Court of Auditors and the proceedings are ongoing pending a final judgment; the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to keep it informed regarding the outcome of Mr Mario Leiva s appeal; and (e) with regard to the allegation that a campaign was carried out from July to December  in order to force over half of INTN Sindical s members to withdraw, the Government maintains that after the General Director (who had allegedly caused the withdrawal) was removed from office, the members who had withdrawn from the union did not re-join it.
.Having taken due note of the foregoing, the Committee notes that the Government s general statement that there is no record showing that the complainants brought administrative proceedings concerning the complaint before the administrative labour authority is inconsistent with various specific references in the documents provided by the complainant, including notes sent to the administrative authority alleging anti-union harassment (for example, as reflected in the minutes of the tripartite meetings, which were certified by ministerial authorities) and letters submitted as part of the complaint, in which INTN Sindical reported acts of anti-union discrimination to the Institute and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. In that regard, the Committee would like to recall that where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. In light of this principle and of the conflicting information received from the parties with respect to the various allegations of anti-union discrimination, the Committee invites the complainant, if it so desires, to provide the competent authorities with the detailed additional information in its possession so that they can investigate any remaining allegations of anti-union discrimination and, if these allegations are confirmed, ensure that the appropriate penalties are imposed and compensation provided. The Committee requests the Government and the complainant to keep it informed in this respect. If the complainant does not provide the additional detailed information referred to, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.Concerning the allegation that the Institute s General Directorate requested revocation of the registration of INTN Sindical, the Committee takes due note of the Government s statement that INTN Sindical is still registered although the Institute: (i) maintains that its requests were prompted by the fact that INTN Sindical did not have the minimum number of members required; and (ii) states that it will request revocation of the registration of any union that does not meet the criteria established by law (section  of the Labour Code). On this point, the Committee recalls that in Case No. , it examined specific allegations on the way in which section  of the Labour Code may undermine the rights of public sector workers' organizations and noted that requiring  per cent of workers to be affiliated in public sector institutions of up to  employees could result in a requirement of up to  workers to establish a trade union and that this could, in effect, undermine the right of public sector employees to establish organizations of their own choosing. The Committee refers to its conclusions and recommendations in this case, in which it drew the legislative aspects to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and requested the Government to hold consultations with the social partners concerned in order to ensure that this provision did not, in effect, undermine the right of public sector employees to establish organizations of their own choosing [see st Report, Case No. , para. ].
.With respect to the alleged refusal to bargain collectively, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the Institute is more than willing to sign the collective agreement and is considering the draft that has been submitted. The Committee encourages the Government to promote collective bargaining so that a collective agreement can be signed at the Institute in the near future.
.Concerning the allegation that freedom of expression is restricted pursuant to Decision No. /, while noting the Government s statement that this instrument s purpose is not to restrict the right to freedom of expression, but rather to ensure that communication is better organized, the Committee observes that the decision requires the General Directorate s approval before any announcement or other document can be posted. In that connection, the Committee recalls that the publication and distribution of news and information of general or special interest to trade unions and their members constitutes a legitimate trade union activity and the application of measures designed to control publication and means of information may involve serious interference by administrative authorities with this activity. The Committee",-1,2015,Paraguay
9,"recalls that the  International Labour Conference resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties places special emphasis on the civil liberties essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights, including the right to freedom of opinion and expression and, in particular, the freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media. The Committee hopes that in light of the principles of freedom of association, the concerned parties will address the issue of the use of communication channels for trade union purposes during the aforementioned collective bargaining.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee invites the complainant, if it so desires, to provide the competent authorities with the detailed additional information in its possession so that they can investigate any remaining allegations of anti-union discrimination and, if these allegations are confirmed, ensure that the appropriate penalties are imposed and compensation provided. The Committee requests the Government and the complainant to keep it informed of developments in this respect and of the outcome of the appeal brought by Mr Mario Leiva. If the complainant does not provide the additional detailed information referred to, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.(b)	The Committee encourages the Government to promote collective bargaining so that a collective agreement can be signed at the Institute in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",1,2015,Paraguay
10,".The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to investigate the alleged anti-union motives for the mass dismissals and to keep it informed in this respect, and particularly with regard to the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way, and to send copies of the respective rulings.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to promote within the binational entity: (i) collective negotiation in good faith on conditions of work; and (ii) social dialogue and consultation between the parties to address any issues that are still pending, including with regard to the internal regulations of the binational entity, in the light of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) The Committee requests the Government to seek information from the employers' organization concerned, so that the Committee may be apprised of its views and those of the binational entity.
.In a communication dated  January , the Government provided the following information in respect of the Committee s recommendations, which convey the point of view of the binational employer entity:(i) with regard to the alleged anti-union dismissals and judicial proceedings, the binational entity states that no proceedings have been brought against it and, consequently, no convictions or reinstatement orders have been issued ' the requested rulings cannot be sent as they do not exist;(ii) the collective agreement negotiations were concluded on  June  ( August ), and consequently, at the time of the alleged events (and also currently), no collective bargaining process was under way;(iii) the binational entity is governed by special international legislation and not by the provisions of article  et seq. of the Labour Code and, in this context, the executive council of the entity is responsible for drafting the staff regulations and its administrative council for endorsing them;(iv) the trade union leaders mentioned in the complaint were not entitled to trade union immunity as negotiators of a collective agreement in , as the negotiations had concluded in June  ' the certificates of trade union immunity issued in  were consequently cancelled, as they had been wrongfully issued (this was established by way of Ministry of Labour decisions dated  September  and  January );(v) a total of  trade unions are registered in the binational entity and the guarantees of freedom of association are respected; and(vi) the Yacyret Binational Entity Employees' Union (SEMEBY) is currently inactive and the mandate of its general secretary expired on  October .
.Under these circumstances, having taken due note of the information submitted by the Government, observing that the complainant organization (the Single Confederation of Workers of Paraguay) has not provided any further information, and trusting that the necessary measures will be taken to continue to promote collective bargaining and social dialogue in the binational entity in the light of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining, the Committee considers this case closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  March  from the Single Confederation of Workers of Paraguay (CUT).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  March and  April , the complainant organization denounces action taken against the Yacyret Binational Entity Employees' Union (SEMEBY), affiliated to the CUT, by the Argentine Paraguayan Yacyret hydroelectric power plant (hereinafter: binational entity). The CUT alleges that the use of force, ideological violence, discrimination and systematic anti-union persecution are widespread at the binational entity, and negotiation of a collective agreement ' let alone of any internal regulations ' is not allowed. The complainant alleges that anti-union persecution has been occurring since August .
.According to the complainant organization, the binational entity has arbitrary recourse to its founding treaty despite the fact that, under the terms of the treaty, the authorities' conduct is subject to the laws in force in each country. The CUT also states that the binational entity adopted new internal regulations behind the backs of the workers without consulting the trade unions. In its opinion, the binational entity used this instrument to launch a campaign of dismissals, thereby causing a serious labour dispute within the entity. The CUT adds that the union members expressed the wish to talk to the director of the entity on several occasions but the latter refused to see the workers. Furthermore, the CUT indicates that the new regulations do not recognize the Paraguayan Labour Code and do not safeguard seniority or trade union immunity. In this regard, the complainant alleges that the binational entity sent a note to the Government stating that staff regulation matters cannot be addressed through the laws of either of the States signatory to the agreement but are subject to the machinery of international law, in the particular case of the binational entity, by the standards established by it. The CUT asserts that, according to the binational entity, the founding treaty prevails unquestionably over the laws of either of the signatory States (Argentina and Paraguay).
.As regards the mass dismissals, the complainant organization alleges that from  August to  December  hundreds of dismissals occurred for ideological reasons and trade union persecution occurred within the binational entity. The CUT indicates that the dismissals included those of  SEMEBY members. According to the complainant, the dismissals were unjustified and evidently stemmed from discrimination of a partisan and ideological nature. In its opinion, the measure is part of the downsizing of government structures by the current national executive, involving the dismissal of persons branded as  leftists' purely for having gained entry under the last national executive, in . The CUT indicates that since this was a case of mass dismissals, authorization should have been sought from the labour administrative authority, but this did not happen. The complainant adds that Argentine law, which applies at the binational entity, prohibits mass dismissals except for reasons of force majeure. In this respect, the complainant alleges that the binational entity failed to send its representative to a tripartite meeting scheduled for  November  which had been convened by the Ministry of Justice and Labour to deal with the reinstatement of  dismissed workers.
.The CUT also adds that the dismissals included leaders who enjoyed trade union immunity (such as negotiators of the collective agreement on conditions of work), a delegate at the office in Encarnacin, and a founding member of SEMEBY. In this regard, the complainant indicates that appeals from  of the  dismissed SEMEBY members are in progress.
.As regards the dismissal on  November  of Mr Jorge Luis Bernis, collective agreement negotiator and general secretary of the union, the complainant indicates that: (i) by Decision No.  of  December  of the Office of the Deputy Labour and Social Security Minister, Mr Bernis had been recognized as a negotiator of the collective agreement; (ii) under section  of the Labour Code, Mr Bernis had double trade union immunity on account of being both the general secretary of SEMEBY, with over  members, and a negotiator of the collective agreement; (iii) on  November , Mr Bernis filed an appeal for reinstatement in trade union office and payment of outstanding remuneration, and requested the precautionary measure of reinstatement; (iv) on  November , Mr Bernis attached to his appeal the certificate of trade union immunity issued by the supreme labour authority; and (v) however, observing the pressure that existed and the collusion of high-ranking officials within the binational entity and the Government, Mr Bernis decided to withdraw the appeal and accept the partial compensation provided in the staff regulations. In this regard, the complainant alleges irregularities in the judicial proceedings and interference by the Government and the binational entity, in particular: (i) in the precautionary measure for the reinstatement of Mr Bernis, the CUT alleges that the judge showed active bias favouring the employer in the production of evidence by requesting a series of background documents from the Ministry of Justice and Labour which were used in the binational entity s presentation; (ii) on  December , the representatives of the binational entity challenged the appeal lodged by Mr Bernis without the due notification having occurred (according to the complainant, this abuse of procedure was intended to put pressure on the judge, and on  December , the response was allowed by order, in violation of the principles of labour law); (iii) as regards union immunity, the CUT denounces the statement by the Legal Director at the Ministry of Justice and Labour that Mr Bernis does not have union immunity because the negotiation of the collective agreement was the subject of judicial proceedings (this constituted interference",1,2015,Paraguay
11,"in the union s decision, with disregard for the certified trade union immunity of Mr Bernis and lack of competence to interpret the labour legislation); and (iv) on  November , the Minister of Labour annulled the trade union immunity granted to Mr Bernis and two other union members by Decision No. / (in this regard, the CUT indicates that revocation of notified acts such as the registration of trade union immunity for a collective agreement negotiator is restricted to cases of clear irregularities, and denounces the fact that the power of the administration prohibits the revocation of regular administrative acts that grant subjective rights once they have been notified).
.Furthermore, the CUT denounces that for  years the binational entity has not negotiated a single collective agreement, contrary to the terms of section  of the Labour Code, which states as follows:  Any enterprise that employs  or more workers shall have the obligation to conclude a collective agreement on conditions of work. The general conditions shall be negotiated with any organized trade union that exists there.' According to the complainant organization, the entity is failing to comply with its statutory obligation to conclude, sign and validate a collective agreement.
.In addition, the complainant organization reports persecution of labour judges. In this regard, it alleges that two judges were reported and suspended for having reinstated officials in their posts at the binational entity. It adds that the competence to interpret and enforce labour regulations and the rules of labour procedure in the event of a dispute lies exclusively with the labour courts and tribunals and not, as has occurred in practice, with the Judicial Disciplinary Board.
.In its communication of  July , the Government sent its observations relating to the allegations made by the complainant organization. As regards the allegations concerning the arbitrary use of the founding treaty, the Government indicates that the binational entity is a Paraguayan Argentine undertaking with equal capital investment, established under a treaty signed by the Republic of Paraguay and the Argentine Republic on  December , and ratified in Paraguay by Act No.  of  December . The Government indicates that the entity is governed by the provisions of the treaty, its annexes and other diplomatic instruments in force. With regard to labour matters, the Government indicates that the binational entity is governed by the  labour and social security protocol' adopted in Paraguay through Act No.  of  November .
.As regards the allegations concerning trade union immunity, the Government states that the certificate of trade union immunity for Mr Jorge Luis Bernis and Mr Hernan Viera, as collective agreement negotiators, was registered at the Department of Collective Relations and Registration on  November . However, the Government indicates that Decision No. / of the Office of the Deputy Minister of Labour annulled the aforementioned certificate.
.As regards the dismissal of members of SEMEBY, the Government indicates that the Collective Dispute Mediation Department at the Ministry of Labour stated that a note was submitted denouncing the mass dismissal of workers, and this led to the scheduling of a tripartite meeting for  November  to seek conciliation between the parties. However, the Government indicates that this meeting did not go ahead because of the withdrawal of the complainant. As regards the legal actions brought in the labour court by the dismissed workers, the Government provides copies of judicial decisions relating to six of the lodged appeals. These judicial decisions show that: the case of Mr Jose Rafael Ciro Rojas is before the Labour Appeal Court; the cases of Mr Hernan Ignacio Viera Zorrilla, Mr Ymer Hanamel Garay Sanchez and Ms Andrea Lorena Pintos Santander are before the first-instance labour court (second rota); the case of Mr Jorge Luis Bernis concerning restoration of union status was before the third rota of the court but the union leader withdrew his complaint; and in the case of Ms Rogelia Esmelda Zarza Sanabria, the action was declared out of time at the appeal stage.
.As regards the negotiation of a collective agreement on conditions of work, the Government indicates that a note of  March  from the Secretariat-General of the Office of the Deputy Labour Minister stated that no collective agreement relating to the binational entity has been registered and no decision validating a collective agreement has been issued.
.The Government indicates, in a communication dated  April , that the binational entity categorically rejected the allegations made in the complaint. The Government adds that it asked the entity to expand its response and provide more details of the events that occurred, with supporting documentary evidence.
.The Committee notes that the present case is concerned with allegations of absence of dialogue and collective bargaining, mass dismissals of trade union leaders and members, and failure to respect trade union immunity.
.As regards the allegations of mass anti-union dismissals and failure to respect trade union immunity, the Committee notes the complainant organization s indications that: (i) in the context of mass dismissals of hundreds of workers on ideological and anti-union grounds, approximately  leaders and members of the SEMEBY union were dismissed between  August and  December  (the complainant supplies the names of  dismissed members who lodged appeals with the labour tribunals); and (ii) in the case of the SEMEBY general secretary and collective agreement negotiator Mr Jorge Luis Bernis, the trade union immunity that he enjoyed was not respected and there was interference by the authorities in the proceedings that were conducted, until the aforementioned union leader, on account of the pressures and perceived irregularities, decided to withdraw from the judicial proceedings and accept partial compensation. In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government: (i) has provided copies of the judicial decisions relating to six of the appeals referred to by the complainant (from the content of these decisions, the Committee understands that, at the time of the Government s communication, four of the court cases were still in progress and two had been concluded without entering into the substance, one on account of withdrawal, the other for having expired); and (ii) indicates that Decision No. / of the Office of the Deputy Labour Minister annulled the trade union immunity of Mr Jorge Luis Bernis and of another negotiator of the collective agreement on conditions of work. The Committee observes that the Government has not sent a copy of Decision No. /, does not specify any grounds for annulling the union immunity, and does not make any observation regarding the allegations of interference by the authorities. Furthermore, the Committee notes that, in view of the report of mass dismissals, the Collective Dispute Mediation Department at the Ministry of Labour scheduled a tripartite meeting for  November  with a view to achieving conciliation but that the information provided by the parties with regard to the meeting differs: the complainant alleges that the initiative was unsuccessful because the binational entity did not send its representative, while the Government indicates that the meeting was not held because of the withdrawal of the complainant.
.Expressing regret at not having more information on these serious allegations of mass anti-union dismissals despite the time that has elapsed (information has only been received on six of the  appeals referred to by the complainant organization and so far there has been no comment whatsoever on the alleged anti-union motives), the Committee recalls that complaints against acts of anti-union discrimination should normally be examined by national machinery which, in addition to being speedy, should not only be impartial but also be seen to be such by the parties concerned, who should participate in the procedure in an appropriate and constructive manner [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to investigate the alleged anti-union motives for the mass dismissals and to keep it informed in this respect, particularly with regard to the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way, and to send copies of the respective rulings.
.The Committee also notes that the complainant organization: (i) denounces the absence of collective bargaining at the binational entity (emphasizing that for  years the binational entity has not negotiated a single collective agreement, and that the above allegations of anti-union action and interference were connected with an attempt to negotiate); and (ii) alleges that the binational entity, without consulting the trade union, adopted new internal regulations which do not recognize the applicability of the Labour Code, particularly with regard to trade union immunity, and that these were used in the campaign of dismissals. Furthermore, the Committee notes the Government s statements that: (i) there is no record in its registers of any collective agreement on conditions of work relating to the binational entity, or any decision validating a collective agreement; and (ii) for labour matters, the binational entity is governed by the  labour and social security protocol' adopted in Paraguay by Act No.  of  November  (the",1,2015,Paraguay
12,"Committee has noted the fact that under section  of the protocol the trade union rights of workers at the binational entity are determined by the law of the country in which the workers are hired).
.In this regard, the Committee underlines the importance that it attaches to the promotion of dialogue and consultation. It recalls that measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements; and it recalls the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relations [see Compilation, op. cit. paras  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to promote within the binational entity: (i) collective negotiation in good faith on conditions of work; and (ii) social dialogue and consultation between the parties to address any issues that are still pending, including with regard to the internal regulations of the binational entity, in the light of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee observes that despite the time that has elapsed since the presentation of the complaint, no detailed information has been received from the binational entity concerning these allegations, other than a denial thereof, despite the Government s indication that it asked the entity to expedite this process. The Committee requests the Government to seek information from the employers' organization concerned, so that the Committee may be apprised of its views and those of the binational entity.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to investigate the alleged anti-union motives for the mass dismissals and to keep it informed in this respect, and particularly with regard to the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way, and to send copies of the respective rulings.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to promote within the binational entity: (i) collective negotiation in good faith on conditions of work; and (ii) social dialogue and consultation between the parties to address any issues that are still pending, including with regard to the internal regulations of the binational entity, in the light of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to seek information from the employers' organization concerned, so that the Committee may be apprised of its views and those of the binational entity.",1,2015,Paraguay
13,".The Case No.  complaint is contained in a communication of  December  from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). The Case No.  complaint is contained in communications of  January  from the League of Maritime Workers of Paraguay (LOMP) and of  March  from the WFTU.
.The Government sent its observations concerning both complaints in a communication of  January .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  December , and  January and  March , the complainant organizations make the following allegations.
.The complainant organizations allege that the law requires the intervention of the authorized trade unions to determine which dockworkers are to be recruited, in accordance with article (c) of Act No.  of  (which requires that dockworkers be nominated by the executive committee of the respective trade union for recruitment). The complainant organizations allege that: (i) under Executive Decree No. /, various labour jurisdictions were granted to the trade unions of LOMP; (ii) in the port of Caacupe-m, the San Francisco SA enterprise outsourced its dock work to evade the legal requirements, using subcontracting and to that end establishing the affiliated company Jerovi Servicios SA; (iii) private port enterprises, and in particular San Francisco SA and its affiliated company Jerovi Servicios SA, violate Act No. / by hiring workers who are not members of the trade unions authorized for the respective jurisdiction; and (iv) the Prefecture-General for Shipping and the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping, at the instigation of the association of port managers, issue work permits to dockworkers who do not meet the requirements of Act No. /. In view of this situation, LOMP filed a complaint with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, requesting an inspection to determine whether the dockworkers who are hired comply with the legal requirements relating to authorization and whether they are members of the trade unions authorized to provide access to recruitment (LOMP indicates that the Human Rights Committee of the Senate requested a report from the Prefecture-General for Shipping in a note dated  December ). Accordingly, on  December an inspection report was published, which indicated that three attempts had been necessary before the inspection could be carried out and that it had found that the dockworkers concerned were not employed by either San Francisco SA or by the subcontractor Jerovi Servicios SA and other employees of the latter enterprise were working there at the time. The complainants consider that the inspection report and the enterprise s actions provide evidence that it has committed violations: the inspection report found, firstly, that the workers were not members of any of the trade unions authorized to supply the necessary staff, in violation of article  of Act No. / and, secondly, that in a tripartite meeting held on  November  with representatives of LOMP, the representatives of San Francisco SA claimed the right to hire workers of their choosing. The complainants conclude that, by allowing the enterprise to choose its dockworkers and the fact that the Prefecture-General for Shipping authorizes this, the State is violating the legal provisions in force.
.Furthermore, the complainant organizations refer to a number of collective agreements recognizing the trade unions' right to propose dockworkers for recruitment in the labour jurisdictions for which those trade unions are authorized (in particular, the collective agreement of  between the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers and Related Services (SEMA) and the Small and Large-Scale Cabotage Shipowners/Association of River Shipowners (CAF); the collective agreement adopted by a decision of  February  between the Association of Shipping Agents (ASAMAR) and the Trade Union of Port Checking Clerks of the Capital (SAPAC, a member of LOMP); and the agreement of  May  between SEMA and the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers of Zeballos Cu). The complainants report that, although in the past the public authorities, including the judiciary, had recognized the applicability of these collective agreements and the jurisdiction of the trade unions, in recent years there has been a failure to apply the provisions contained in the agreements concerning the role of the trade unions in the selection of workers. In particular, they allege that the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, through the Prefecture-General for Shipping, allow and even encourage non-compliance with the collective agreement between ASAMAR and SAPAC and that the Supreme Court of Justice revoked the aforementioned collective agreement by Ruling No.  of  September  (not allowing the participation of the trade unions in the judicial proceedings ' a matter which was the subject of another allegation).
.The WFTU also alleges that the private port enterprises refuse collective bargaining, even though article  of the Labour Code provides that enterprises with more than  workers are obliged to enter into a collective agreement governing conditions of work.
.The WFTU indicates that the owners of the Caacupe-m port dismissed more than  workers simply because they were trade union members and that, while some of these workers managed to get reinstated, the dismissal of the other workers is still effective. LOMP, for its part, alleges the unfair dismissal of  workers.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the employers in the private ports refuse to hire workers who are members of LOMP trade unions (despite being in labour jurisdictions granted to those trade unions) and that they only hire workers individually on condition that they do not join a union.
.The complainant organizations indicate that LOMP organized a demonstration on  November  for workers in their member trade unions to protest against the violations of their members' rights by the San Francisco SA enterprise and its affiliated company, Jerovi Servicios SA, in dismissing  workers. The complainants indicate that eight to ten canoes took up positions on the Paraguay River as a symbolic act of protest, while a demonstration was being held on land opposite the Caacupe-m port. The complainants indicate that these flimsy canoes did not constitute any obstacle for vessels of any size moving along the Paraguay River; in fact, when the launch from the Prefecture-General for Shipping passed by, the wash was strong enough to overturn one of the canoes. The complainants indicate that, in response to an action filed by the enterprise, the Criminal Judge of Guarantees No.  of the capital issued an emergency preventive measure, under a ruling of  December of , ordering the workers to refrain from obstructing freedom of movement on the Paraguay River and from preventing the entry and exit of vehicles and persons to and from the port premises, whereupon the Prefecture-General for Shipping intervened to arrest the workers who were protesting. The complainants consider that, under this preventive measure, a decision was taken on the substance of the matter without requiring the claimant to pay the bond for costs, as provided for by law. The complainants add that, as a result of the complaint filed by the enterprise, an order was given for the detention of  workers ' whose names are listed in the complaint by LOMP ' who were placed in preventive detention on the basis of article  of the Criminal Code of Paraguay (concerning dangerous interference in shipping) and are facing a six-year prison sentence. The complainants add that, following an appeal against the preventive detention measure, the  workers were put under house arrest, which still prevents them from working or supporting their families. The complainants consider that the preventive measures violate freedom of association.
.The complainant organizations allege that repeated rulings of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice curtail trade union freedom by restricting the trade unions' ability to represent their members. The complainants refer to three rulings in particular:(i) Ruling No.  of  December  concerning a claim for the payment of wages to SEMA members, brought against a shipping enterprise domiciled outside Paraguay that occasionally employed a national enterprise to manage unloading and other services. In this ruling, the Supreme Court of Justice concluded that the  law does not authorize trade unions to represent their members vis--vis the judicial authorities without an express mandate' and that  the ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, but it is currently the legal provision in force, whereby the law does not confer direct procedural competence on the trade unions to represent their members before the courts, requiring the maximum authority of the trade union ' the assembly ' to grant an express mandate to bring legal actions' and that the trade union did not provide any kind of instrument conferring such authorization. The complainants allege, however, that the court had received the minutes of SEMA s general assembly, which were incorporated into a valid public instrument (pp. ' ), and this shows that the assembly",-1,2015,Paraguay
14,"decided to file an appeal but that the Court had not seen the document. The complainants allege that, as a result of this ruling, the payment of money owed to the workers was prevented;(ii) Ruling No.  of  November , referred to above, declaring articles  and  of the collective agreement ' which had previously recognized the trade unions' right to nominate workers for recruitment ' to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it could undermine possible pay increases for non-unionized workers. According to the complainant organizations, although the assembly s minutes conferring an express mandate had been submitted under aforementioned Ruling No. , the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the trade union concerned (SAPAC) was not authorized to file a claim for the payment of wages (accrued prior to the declaration of unconstitutionality) and that each individual union member should file his own claim, which, according to the complainants, was impossible as a claim could only be filed for the total amount that was alleged to be unpaid; and(iii) Ruling No.  of  October  regarding the claim for reimbursement of US$ million to workers who had contributed to the defunct National Workers' Bank. The Court, while again recognizing that the ensuing deregulation could be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, rejected the claim on the basis of the doctrine underlying aforementioned Ruling No. , finding that the trade unions did not have an express mandate from their members to bring the legal action or the necessary legal capacity (in this regard, the complainant organizations claim that the trade unions had submitted the requisite powers of attorney to file the claim). The complainants add that, as a result of this decision, the money owed was never reimbursed.
.In its communications of  January , the Government submits the observations of the enterprise and of the public authorities concerned.
.In its observations, the enterprise denies the allegations and indicates the following: (i) the San Francisco SA enterprise is responsible for private operations in Caacupe-m port, while the Jerovi Servicios SA enterprise is responsible for outsourcing certain services, and they have both been inspected by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which found that they comply with the labour regulations; (ii) there was a contractual relationship for the provision of services between Jerovi Servicios SA and various trade unions (Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers of Zeballos Cu and SEMA from the Caacupe-m district, both members of LOMP); (iii) the trade unions themselves acted as employers, in other words, they provided services through their registered workers; (iv) the enterprises did not dismiss any workers since the latter were not their employees; (v) in November , as a result of a dispute between the trade unions and the enterprises relating to service contracts, LOMP and the trade unions took industrial action entailing the closure of the Paraguay River and of land access points to Caacupe-m port; (vi) the enterprise terminated the service contracts with the trade unions, alleging serious non-compliance on their part ' including the consequences of the industrial action taken by the trade unions; (vii) on  February , a tripartite conciliation meeting was held at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security in which: (a) the trade unions indicated that  rather than  people had been dismissed; (b) the enterprise explained that it had not filed the criminal proceedings against the workers for their involvement in the industrial action (they had been filed by the Public Prosecutor s Office) and that it would not oppose any requests to lift the detention measures; (c) the possibility of restoring the original conditions prior to the dispute was discussed and the enterprise declared its willingness to employ any workers who might be interested, but stated that recruitment could not be imposed purely according to whether or not a dockworker belonged to a specific trade union organization, whereupon the parties agreed that the only requirement would be the registration of dockworkers with the Prefecture-General for Shipping; and (d) the tripartite meeting resulted in an agreement between the parties to work in good faith to resolve the situation of the  workers who were being prosecuted, to initiate negotiations to re-establish the contractual relations governing the delivery of services and to drop all judicial, extrajudicial and trade union actions, as a sign of good faith; (viii) however, the negotiations were not successful, given that the trade unions did not drop the judicial actions that they had filed; (ix) as regards the alleged refusal to hire union members, the enterprise states that: (a) the statement is incorrect and LOMP s true intention is to restrict recruitment to trade union members; (b) LOMP filed a legal action seeking to ban the enterprises from hiring non-union members (arguing that the right to work in the area is limited to these unions, to which the enterprises responded that the law guarantees their right to hire staff freely); the enterprise indicates that the legal action was subsequently dropped by LOMP; and (c) it is LOMP which is violating freedom of association by excluding the possibility of hiring workers who are not its members and by restricting the freedom of association of non-unionized workers; (x) as regards the alleged refusal to sign a collective agreement, the two trade unions referred to above are the employers of those they refer to as members, and so there is a legal obstacle to their signing a collective agreement, given that the document cannot be signed by more than one employer; (xi) as regards the allegation of violation by the enterprise of the rule that only trade union members are allowed to work in a given jurisdiction, the enterprise alleges that the rule was established under the previous Labour Code, which included a provision whereby collective agreements could contain a clause under which the employer was obliged only to hire workers who were members of the trade union party to the agreement; according to the enterprise, this is an old provision which runs counter to the Constitution of Paraguay and to the ILO Conventions.
.As regards the allegation of anti-union discrimination (dismissal of workers and non-recruitment of union members), the Government indicates that, following the complaint concerning the mass dismissal of members of the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers of Zeballos Cu and the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers and Related Services (SEMA) of the Caacupe-m district, the representatives of the private port of San Francisco Caacupe-m and the representatives of the complainant trade unions were called to two tripartite meetings at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security in September . When the enterprise representative failed to attend the second meeting, the workers' representatives requested a general inspection, which resulted in an inspection order dated  October  to review the employment situation of the dockworkers concerned and the employer s compliance with the regulations. At the first two attempts, the inspectors were unable to conduct the inspection owing to the refusal of the enterprise s legal adviser, who claimed that the inspectors could only enter the premises to conduct the inspection if they had a court order. The inspection was carried out at the third attempt, on  October . The Government indicates that the inspection found that the workers alleging the violation of their rights were members of the trade union organizations of maritime dockworkers but that they were not employees of the enterprise in question.
.As regards the allegations of refusal of collective bargaining, the Government provides a list of  collective agreements governing conditions of work which were approved for the years  to  and were signed by maritime and river enterprises (the two enterprises operating in Caacupe-m port referred to above do not appear on the list).
.As regards the allegations of violations of freedom of association and of dispersal of workers participating in protest actions on the Paraguay River on  December , the Government submits a note from the Prefecture-General for Shipping, which indicates that: (i) this institution acted within the framework of legality and in compliance with a judicial order of  November  issued by the Civil and Commercial Judge of First Instance, ordering the end of the blockade of the Paraguay River at all points; and (ii) the dockworkers were notified in due time and form but they refused to comply with the ruling, whereupon the persons involved were arrested and handed over to the Public Prosecutor s Office.
.The Government adds that the right to strike is guaranteed for workers in both the public and private sectors and that, in the case referred to in this complaint, the striking workers blockaded the Paraguay River, affecting the free passage and movement of vessels, which was aggravated by the fact that the country is landlocked and the Paraguay River is its main waterway. Accordingly, the Government indicates that article  of the Criminal Code was applied, which provides that any person who creates an",1,2015,Paraguay
15,"obstacle endangering the safety of air or rail transport or shipping shall be liable to imprisonment of up to six years.
.As regards the court decisions contested by the complainant organizations as limiting the possibility of trade unions to represent their members, the Government observes that these are final rulings that have been implemented and that they were issued by the ordinary courts, as the latter are competent to do under the rule of law.
.The Committee decided to consider these two cases together in so far as they involve the same allegations supported by the same international complainant.
.The Committee observes that one of the central issues raised in the complaints concerns the allegation that, under certain items of legislation and collective agreements, it is the prerogative of the trade unions authorized in each jurisdiction to nominate dockworkers to carry out work in the ports concerned (the complainant organizations report that both the enterprise and the public authorities have violated this trade union prerogative). On the other hand, the Committee observes that the enterprise in question alleges that it is the League of Maritime Workers of Paraguay (LOMP) which is violating freedom of association by seeking to impose the selection of workers, exclude the possibility of hiring workers that are not members of its trade unions, and curtail the freedom of association of non-unionized workers. In that regard, the Committee wishes to recall that a distinction should be made between union security clauses allowed by law and those imposed by law, only the latter of which appear to result in a trade union monopoly system contrary to the principles of freedom of association; that problems related to union security clauses should be resolved at the national level, in conformity with national practice and the industrial relations system in each country; and that both situations where union security clauses are authorized and those where they are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee recalls that union security clauses should be agreed freely and observes that the complaints contain no elements to show that the enterprises concerned have agreed to a union security clause; on the contrary, the observations provided show their opposition to any such clause.
.The Committee also observes that the complaints contain allegations of anti-union discrimination (dismissals and non-recruitment of union members) and refusal to engage in collective bargaining. In this regard, the Committee observes that, although the complainant organizations refer to the subcontractor as the dockworkers' employer, the enterprise that manages the port indicates that the legal relationship was based on service contracts between the subcontractor and the trade unions, which were the employers. The Committee observes that an inspection was conducted to monitor the enterprise s compliance with the labour regulations and, in particular, to investigate the allegations of anti-union dismissals, but that the inspection did not find any violation and found that the workers that claimed a violation of their rights were members of the trade unions of maritime dockworkers and were not employed by the enterprise against which the complaint had been filed. Moreover, the Committee observes that the enterprise indicates that: (i) since the employment relationship was based on service contracts with the trade unions, there was no possibility of collective bargaining on account of the legal obstacle arising from the fact that the workers were employed by the trade union; (ii) no dismissals were carried out, but rather the service contracts with the trade unions were terminated on the grounds of serious non-compliance by the unions (the enterprise includes in this the blockade of the Paraguay River, which reportedly took place after the dismissals); (iii) the enterprise indicated that it was open to hiring the dockworkers who had lost their jobs; and (iv) the enterprise claims that it does not exclude workers who are trade union members from recruitment, but that it is opposed to the imposition of the recruitment of trade union members only. In these circumstances, the Committee does not have the necessary information to conclude that the issues raised involve acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Furthermore, the Committee welcomes the conciliation efforts made by the Government to address the dispute between the parties, in particular through the tripartite meeting of  February , which, according to the enterprise, yielded the beginnings of an agreement. The Committee invites the Government to continue promoting negotiations between the parties and encourages the parties to continue their dialogue with a view to finding joint solutions in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee observes that the complaints contain allegations of violation of the right to demonstrate and the criminal prosecution and detention of workers for participating in a strike through an act of protest involving the positioning of canoes on the Paraguay River. According to the complainant organizations, this action did not obstruct the passage of any vessel but resulted in the prosecution of  workers, who remain under house arrest. The Committee observes that the Government, for its part, alleges that: (i) the striking workers blockaded the Paraguay River, affecting the free passage and movement of vessels, whereupon a judge ordered the end of the blockade at all points on the Paraguay River; and (ii) the dockworkers were notified in due time and form but they refused to comply with the order, whereupon they were arrested and handed over to the Public Prosecutor s Office, and article  of the Criminal Code was applied, which provides for imprisonment of up to six years for any person who creates an obstacle that threatens the safety of shipping.
.The Committee wishes to recall that, according to Article  of Convention No. , although, in exercising the rights provided for in the Convention, workers and employers and their respective organizations, like other persons or organized collectivities, shall respect the law of the land, the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in the Convention. In that regard, the Committee wishes to refer to the following principles: that workers should enjoy the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests; that preventive detention should be limited to very short periods of time intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry; that workers should enjoy prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences; and that the authorities should not resort to arrests and imprisonment in connection with the organization of or participation in a peaceful strike, since such measures entail serious risks of abuse and constitute a grave threat to freedom of association [see Digest, op. cit., paras , ,  and ].
.Noting that the Government does not deny that the strike was peaceful or that  workers are still being prosecuted and under house arrest, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings brought against the workers who participated in the protest actions on the Paraguay River and at land access points to the Caacupe-m port, trusting that the proceedings will be settled as soon as possible and bearing in mind the aforementioned principles of freedom of association. The Committee also invites the authorities to consider lifting the preventive detention measures.
.The Committee notes with concern the allegations of restriction of the trade unions' right to represent their members, and of the consequences that could arise from the refusal of representation to the trade unions (according to the complainant organizations, failure to win claims for substantial sums of money affecting a large number of workers). The Committee observes that the complainants refer to three rulings by the Supreme Court of Justice, denying the unions the possibility of representation on the grounds that no express mandate had been given by the trade union s assembly (the complainants claim, however, that in at least two of the three cases they had submitted the assembly minutes conferring an express mandate). The Committee also observes that, although the Government does not go into the substance of the issue and merely recognizes the existence of the rulings in question, the Supreme Court of Justice itself, while considering an express mandate to be legally necessary, found in two of the rulings that  the ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union'  In this regard, the Committee considers that neither the legislation nor the application thereof should limit the right of employers' and workers' organizations to represent their members, including in cases of individual labour complaints. The Committee invites the Government to examine, in consultation with the social partners, the adequacy of the legislation and of the application thereof in order to ensure that employers' and workers' organizations are able",-1,2015,Paraguay

17,".The Case No.  complaint is contained in a communication of  December  from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). The Case No.  complaint is contained in communications of  January  from the League of Maritime Workers of Paraguay (LOMP) and of  March  from the WFTU.
.The Government sent its observations concerning both complaints in a communication of  January .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  December , and  January and  March , the complainant organizations make the following allegations.
.The complainant organizations allege that the law requires the intervention of the authorized trade unions to determine which dockworkers are to be recruited, in accordance with article (c) of Act No.  of  (which requires that dockworkers be nominated by the executive committee of the respective trade union for recruitment). The complainant organizations allege that: (i) under Executive Decree No. /, various labour jurisdictions were granted to the trade unions of LOMP; (ii) in the port of Caacupe-m, the San Francisco SA enterprise outsourced its dock work to evade the legal requirements, using subcontracting and to that end establishing the affiliated company Jerovi Servicios SA; (iii) private port enterprises, and in particular San Francisco SA and its affiliated company Jerovi Servicios SA, violate Act No. / by hiring workers who are not members of the trade unions authorized for the respective jurisdiction; and (iv) the Prefecture-General for Shipping and the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping, at the instigation of the association of port managers, issue work permits to dockworkers who do not meet the requirements of Act No. /. In view of this situation, LOMP filed a complaint with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, requesting an inspection to determine whether the dockworkers who are hired comply with the legal requirements relating to authorization and whether they are members of the trade unions authorized to provide access to recruitment (LOMP indicates that the Human Rights Committee of the Senate requested a report from the Prefecture-General for Shipping in a note dated  December ). Accordingly, on  December an inspection report was published, which indicated that three attempts had been necessary before the inspection could be carried out and that it had found that the dockworkers concerned were not employed by either San Francisco SA or by the subcontractor Jerovi Servicios SA and other employees of the latter enterprise were working there at the time. The complainants consider that the inspection report and the enterprise s actions provide evidence that it has committed violations: the inspection report found, firstly, that the workers were not members of any of the trade unions authorized to supply the necessary staff, in violation of article  of Act No. / and, secondly, that in a tripartite meeting held on  November  with representatives of LOMP, the representatives of San Francisco SA claimed the right to hire workers of their choosing. The complainants conclude that, by allowing the enterprise to choose its dockworkers and the fact that the Prefecture-General for Shipping authorizes this, the State is violating the legal provisions in force.
.Furthermore, the complainant organizations refer to a number of collective agreements recognizing the trade unions' right to propose dockworkers for recruitment in the labour jurisdictions for which those trade unions are authorized (in particular, the collective agreement of  between the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers and Related Services (SEMA) and the Small and Large-Scale Cabotage Shipowners/Association of River Shipowners (CAF); the collective agreement adopted by a decision of  February  between the Association of Shipping Agents (ASAMAR) and the Trade Union of Port Checking Clerks of the Capital (SAPAC, a member of LOMP); and the agreement of  May  between SEMA and the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers of Zeballos Cu). The complainants report that, although in the past the public authorities, including the judiciary, had recognized the applicability of these collective agreements and the jurisdiction of the trade unions, in recent years there has been a failure to apply the provisions contained in the agreements concerning the role of the trade unions in the selection of workers. In particular, they allege that the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, through the Prefecture-General for Shipping, allow and even encourage non-compliance with the collective agreement between ASAMAR and SAPAC and that the Supreme Court of Justice revoked the aforementioned collective agreement by Ruling No.  of  September  (not allowing the participation of the trade unions in the judicial proceedings ' a matter which was the subject of another allegation).
.The WFTU also alleges that the private port enterprises refuse collective bargaining, even though article  of the Labour Code provides that enterprises with more than  workers are obliged to enter into a collective agreement governing conditions of work.
.The WFTU indicates that the owners of the Caacupe-m port dismissed more than  workers simply because they were trade union members and that, while some of these workers managed to get reinstated, the dismissal of the other workers is still effective. LOMP, for its part, alleges the unfair dismissal of  workers.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the employers in the private ports refuse to hire workers who are members of LOMP trade unions (despite being in labour jurisdictions granted to those trade unions) and that they only hire workers individually on condition that they do not join a union.
.The complainant organizations indicate that LOMP organized a demonstration on  November  for workers in their member trade unions to protest against the violations of their members' rights by the San Francisco SA enterprise and its affiliated company, Jerovi Servicios SA, in dismissing  workers. The complainants indicate that eight to ten canoes took up positions on the Paraguay River as a symbolic act of protest, while a demonstration was being held on land opposite the Caacupe-m port. The complainants indicate that these flimsy canoes did not constitute any obstacle for vessels of any size moving along the Paraguay River; in fact, when the launch from the Prefecture-General for Shipping passed by, the wash was strong enough to overturn one of the canoes. The complainants indicate that, in response to an action filed by the enterprise, the Criminal Judge of Guarantees No.  of the capital issued an emergency preventive measure, under a ruling of  December of , ordering the workers to refrain from obstructing freedom of movement on the Paraguay River and from preventing the entry and exit of vehicles and persons to and from the port premises, whereupon the Prefecture-General for Shipping intervened to arrest the workers who were protesting. The complainants consider that, under this preventive measure, a decision was taken on the substance of the matter without requiring the claimant to pay the bond for costs, as provided for by law. The complainants add that, as a result of the complaint filed by the enterprise, an order was given for the detention of  workers ' whose names are listed in the complaint by LOMP ' who were placed in preventive detention on the basis of article  of the Criminal Code of Paraguay (concerning dangerous interference in shipping) and are facing a six-year prison sentence. The complainants add that, following an appeal against the preventive detention measure, the  workers were put under house arrest, which still prevents them from working or supporting their families. The complainants consider that the preventive measures violate freedom of association.
.The complainant organizations allege that repeated rulings of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice curtail trade union freedom by restricting the trade unions' ability to represent their members. The complainants refer to three rulings in particular:(i) Ruling No.  of  December  concerning a claim for the payment of wages to SEMA members, brought against a shipping enterprise domiciled outside Paraguay that occasionally employed a national enterprise to manage unloading and other services. In this ruling, the Supreme Court of Justice concluded that the  law does not authorize trade unions to represent their members vis--vis the judicial authorities without an express mandate' and that  the ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, but it is currently the legal provision in force, whereby the law does not confer direct procedural competence on the trade unions to represent their members before the courts, requiring the maximum authority of the trade union ' the assembly ' to grant an express mandate to bring legal actions' and that the trade union did not provide any kind of instrument conferring such authorization. The complainants allege, however, that the court had received the minutes of SEMA s general assembly, which were incorporated into a valid public instrument (pp. ' ), and this shows that the assembly",-1,2014,Paraguay
18,"decided to file an appeal but that the Court had not seen the document. The complainants allege that, as a result of this ruling, the payment of money owed to the workers was prevented;(ii) Ruling No.  of  November , referred to above, declaring articles  and  of the collective agreement ' which had previously recognized the trade unions' right to nominate workers for recruitment ' to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it could undermine possible pay increases for non-unionized workers. According to the complainant organizations, although the assembly s minutes conferring an express mandate had been submitted under aforementioned Ruling No. , the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the trade union concerned (SAPAC) was not authorized to file a claim for the payment of wages (accrued prior to the declaration of unconstitutionality) and that each individual union member should file his own claim, which, according to the complainants, was impossible as a claim could only be filed for the total amount that was alleged to be unpaid; and(iii) Ruling No.  of  October  regarding the claim for reimbursement of US$ million to workers who had contributed to the defunct National Workers' Bank. The Court, while again recognizing that the ensuing deregulation could be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, rejected the claim on the basis of the doctrine underlying aforementioned Ruling No. , finding that the trade unions did not have an express mandate from their members to bring the legal action or the necessary legal capacity (in this regard, the complainant organizations claim that the trade unions had submitted the requisite powers of attorney to file the claim). The complainants add that, as a result of this decision, the money owed was never reimbursed.
.In its communications of  January , the Government submits the observations of the enterprise and of the public authorities concerned.
.In its observations, the enterprise denies the allegations and indicates the following: (i) the San Francisco SA enterprise is responsible for private operations in Caacupe-m port, while the Jerovi Servicios SA enterprise is responsible for outsourcing certain services, and they have both been inspected by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which found that they comply with the labour regulations; (ii) there was a contractual relationship for the provision of services between Jerovi Servicios SA and various trade unions (Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers of Zeballos Cu and SEMA from the Caacupe-m district, both members of LOMP); (iii) the trade unions themselves acted as employers, in other words, they provided services through their registered workers; (iv) the enterprises did not dismiss any workers since the latter were not their employees; (v) in November , as a result of a dispute between the trade unions and the enterprises relating to service contracts, LOMP and the trade unions took industrial action entailing the closure of the Paraguay River and of land access points to Caacupe-m port; (vi) the enterprise terminated the service contracts with the trade unions, alleging serious non-compliance on their part ' including the consequences of the industrial action taken by the trade unions; (vii) on  February , a tripartite conciliation meeting was held at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security in which: (a) the trade unions indicated that  rather than  people had been dismissed; (b) the enterprise explained that it had not filed the criminal proceedings against the workers for their involvement in the industrial action (they had been filed by the Public Prosecutor s Office) and that it would not oppose any requests to lift the detention measures; (c) the possibility of restoring the original conditions prior to the dispute was discussed and the enterprise declared its willingness to employ any workers who might be interested, but stated that recruitment could not be imposed purely according to whether or not a dockworker belonged to a specific trade union organization, whereupon the parties agreed that the only requirement would be the registration of dockworkers with the Prefecture-General for Shipping; and (d) the tripartite meeting resulted in an agreement between the parties to work in good faith to resolve the situation of the  workers who were being prosecuted, to initiate negotiations to re-establish the contractual relations governing the delivery of services and to drop all judicial, extrajudicial and trade union actions, as a sign of good faith; (viii) however, the negotiations were not successful, given that the trade unions did not drop the judicial actions that they had filed; (ix) as regards the alleged refusal to hire union members, the enterprise states that: (a) the statement is incorrect and LOMP s true intention is to restrict recruitment to trade union members; (b) LOMP filed a legal action seeking to ban the enterprises from hiring non-union members (arguing that the right to work in the area is limited to these unions, to which the enterprises responded that the law guarantees their right to hire staff freely); the enterprise indicates that the legal action was subsequently dropped by LOMP; and (c) it is LOMP which is violating freedom of association by excluding the possibility of hiring workers who are not its members and by restricting the freedom of association of non-unionized workers; (x) as regards the alleged refusal to sign a collective agreement, the two trade unions referred to above are the employers of those they refer to as members, and so there is a legal obstacle to their signing a collective agreement, given that the document cannot be signed by more than one employer; (xi) as regards the allegation of violation by the enterprise of the rule that only trade union members are allowed to work in a given jurisdiction, the enterprise alleges that the rule was established under the previous Labour Code, which included a provision whereby collective agreements could contain a clause under which the employer was obliged only to hire workers who were members of the trade union party to the agreement; according to the enterprise, this is an old provision which runs counter to the Constitution of Paraguay and to the ILO Conventions.
.As regards the allegation of anti-union discrimination (dismissal of workers and non-recruitment of union members), the Government indicates that, following the complaint concerning the mass dismissal of members of the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers of Zeballos Cu and the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers and Related Services (SEMA) of the Caacupe-m district, the representatives of the private port of San Francisco Caacupe-m and the representatives of the complainant trade unions were called to two tripartite meetings at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security in September . When the enterprise representative failed to attend the second meeting, the workers' representatives requested a general inspection, which resulted in an inspection order dated  October  to review the employment situation of the dockworkers concerned and the employer s compliance with the regulations. At the first two attempts, the inspectors were unable to conduct the inspection owing to the refusal of the enterprise s legal adviser, who claimed that the inspectors could only enter the premises to conduct the inspection if they had a court order. The inspection was carried out at the third attempt, on  October . The Government indicates that the inspection found that the workers alleging the violation of their rights were members of the trade union organizations of maritime dockworkers but that they were not employees of the enterprise in question.
.As regards the allegations of refusal of collective bargaining, the Government provides a list of  collective agreements governing conditions of work which were approved for the years  to  and were signed by maritime and river enterprises (the two enterprises operating in Caacupe-m port referred to above do not appear on the list).
.As regards the allegations of violations of freedom of association and of dispersal of workers participating in protest actions on the Paraguay River on  December , the Government submits a note from the Prefecture-General for Shipping, which indicates that: (i) this institution acted within the framework of legality and in compliance with a judicial order of  November  issued by the Civil and Commercial Judge of First Instance, ordering the end of the blockade of the Paraguay River at all points; and (ii) the dockworkers were notified in due time and form but they refused to comply with the ruling, whereupon the persons involved were arrested and handed over to the Public Prosecutor s Office.
.The Government adds that the right to strike is guaranteed for workers in both the public and private sectors and that, in the case referred to in this complaint, the striking workers blockaded the Paraguay River, affecting the free passage and movement of vessels, which was aggravated by the fact that the country is landlocked and the Paraguay River is its main waterway. Accordingly, the Government indicates that article  of the Criminal Code was applied, which provides that any person who creates an",1,2014,Paraguay
19,"obstacle endangering the safety of air or rail transport or shipping shall be liable to imprisonment of up to six years.
.As regards the court decisions contested by the complainant organizations as limiting the possibility of trade unions to represent their members, the Government observes that these are final rulings that have been implemented and that they were issued by the ordinary courts, as the latter are competent to do under the rule of law.
.The Committee decided to consider these two cases together in so far as they involve the same allegations supported by the same international complainant.
.The Committee observes that one of the central issues raised in the complaints concerns the allegation that, under certain items of legislation and collective agreements, it is the prerogative of the trade unions authorized in each jurisdiction to nominate dockworkers to carry out work in the ports concerned (the complainant organizations report that both the enterprise and the public authorities have violated this trade union prerogative). On the other hand, the Committee observes that the enterprise in question alleges that it is the League of Maritime Workers of Paraguay (LOMP) which is violating freedom of association by seeking to impose the selection of workers, exclude the possibility of hiring workers that are not members of its trade unions, and curtail the freedom of association of non-unionized workers. In that regard, the Committee wishes to recall that a distinction should be made between union security clauses allowed by law and those imposed by law, only the latter of which appear to result in a trade union monopoly system contrary to the principles of freedom of association; that problems related to union security clauses should be resolved at the national level, in conformity with national practice and the industrial relations system in each country; and that both situations where union security clauses are authorized and those where they are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee recalls that union security clauses should be agreed freely and observes that the complaints contain no elements to show that the enterprises concerned have agreed to a union security clause; on the contrary, the observations provided show their opposition to any such clause.
.The Committee also observes that the complaints contain allegations of anti-union discrimination (dismissals and non-recruitment of union members) and refusal to engage in collective bargaining. In this regard, the Committee observes that, although the complainant organizations refer to the subcontractor as the dockworkers' employer, the enterprise that manages the port indicates that the legal relationship was based on service contracts between the subcontractor and the trade unions, which were the employers. The Committee observes that an inspection was conducted to monitor the enterprise s compliance with the labour regulations and, in particular, to investigate the allegations of anti-union dismissals, but that the inspection did not find any violation and found that the workers that claimed a violation of their rights were members of the trade unions of maritime dockworkers and were not employed by the enterprise against which the complaint had been filed. Moreover, the Committee observes that the enterprise indicates that: (i) since the employment relationship was based on service contracts with the trade unions, there was no possibility of collective bargaining on account of the legal obstacle arising from the fact that the workers were employed by the trade union; (ii) no dismissals were carried out, but rather the service contracts with the trade unions were terminated on the grounds of serious non-compliance by the unions (the enterprise includes in this the blockade of the Paraguay River, which reportedly took place after the dismissals); (iii) the enterprise indicated that it was open to hiring the dockworkers who had lost their jobs; and (iv) the enterprise claims that it does not exclude workers who are trade union members from recruitment, but that it is opposed to the imposition of the recruitment of trade union members only. In these circumstances, the Committee does not have the necessary information to conclude that the issues raised involve acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Furthermore, the Committee welcomes the conciliation efforts made by the Government to address the dispute between the parties, in particular through the tripartite meeting of  February , which, according to the enterprise, yielded the beginnings of an agreement. The Committee invites the Government to continue promoting negotiations between the parties and encourages the parties to continue their dialogue with a view to finding joint solutions in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee observes that the complaints contain allegations of violation of the right to demonstrate and the criminal prosecution and detention of workers for participating in a strike through an act of protest involving the positioning of canoes on the Paraguay River. According to the complainant organizations, this action did not obstruct the passage of any vessel but resulted in the prosecution of  workers, who remain under house arrest. The Committee observes that the Government, for its part, alleges that: (i) the striking workers blockaded the Paraguay River, affecting the free passage and movement of vessels, whereupon a judge ordered the end of the blockade at all points on the Paraguay River; and (ii) the dockworkers were notified in due time and form but they refused to comply with the order, whereupon they were arrested and handed over to the Public Prosecutor s Office, and article  of the Criminal Code was applied, which provides for imprisonment of up to six years for any person who creates an obstacle that threatens the safety of shipping.
.The Committee wishes to recall that, according to Article  of Convention No. , although, in exercising the rights provided for in the Convention, workers and employers and their respective organizations, like other persons or organized collectivities, shall respect the law of the land, the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in the Convention. In that regard, the Committee wishes to refer to the following principles: that workers should enjoy the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests; that preventive detention should be limited to very short periods of time intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry; that workers should enjoy prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences; and that the authorities should not resort to arrests and imprisonment in connection with the organization of or participation in a peaceful strike, since such measures entail serious risks of abuse and constitute a grave threat to freedom of association [see Digest, op. cit., paras , ,  and ].
.Noting that the Government does not deny that the strike was peaceful or that  workers are still being prosecuted and under house arrest, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings brought against the workers who participated in the protest actions on the Paraguay River and at land access points to the Caacupe-m port, trusting that the proceedings will be settled as soon as possible and bearing in mind the aforementioned principles of freedom of association. The Committee also invites the authorities to consider lifting the preventive detention measures.
.The Committee notes with concern the allegations of restriction of the trade unions' right to represent their members, and of the consequences that could arise from the refusal of representation to the trade unions (according to the complainant organizations, failure to win claims for substantial sums of money affecting a large number of workers). The Committee observes that the complainants refer to three rulings by the Supreme Court of Justice, denying the unions the possibility of representation on the grounds that no express mandate had been given by the trade union s assembly (the complainants claim, however, that in at least two of the three cases they had submitted the assembly minutes conferring an express mandate). The Committee also observes that, although the Government does not go into the substance of the issue and merely recognizes the existence of the rulings in question, the Supreme Court of Justice itself, while considering an express mandate to be legally necessary, found in two of the rulings that  the ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union'  In this regard, the Committee considers that neither the legislation nor the application thereof should limit the right of employers' and workers' organizations to represent their members, including in cases of individual labour complaints. The Committee invites the Government to examine, in consultation with the social partners, the adequacy of the legislation and of the application thereof in order to ensure that employers' and workers' organizations are able",-1,2014,Paraguay
20,"to exercise the right to represent their members.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Welcoming the conciliation efforts made, the Committee invites the Government to continue promoting negotiations between the parties and encourages the parties to continue their dialogue with a view to finding joint solutions in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings brought against the workers who participated in the protest actions on the Paraguay River and at land access points to the Caacupe-m port, trusting that the proceedings will be settled as soon as possible and bearing in mind the principles of freedom of association.

21,".The Committee last examined this case at its October  meeting, without having received a reply from the Government, and on that occasion it made the following recommendation [see th Report, para. (b)]:(b)	Observing that the content of the Resolution and the Decision, which are the subject of this complaint, raise problems of conformity with the principles of freedom of association, by establishing that teachers must have been registered for five years in order to obtain trade union leave, by apparently allowing for excessive discretion when granting such leave, and by suspending the deduction of trade union dues in cases of multiple trade union membership, the Committee requests the Government to initiate a dialogue with the most representative organizations affected, with a view to finding satisfactory solutions for both parties concerning trade union leave and the deduction of union dues. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In a communication of  February , the complainant organization (the National Union of Teachers National Trade Union (UNE SN)) presented the following additional allegations:(i)	On  September , the Attorney-General of the Republic filed an application, after the applicable time limit had passed, calling for a three-day strike staged by the UNE SN on  and  August and on  October  to be declared illegal. As more than a year had passed, the action was time-barred but the Labour Court ruled in favour of the application and declared the strike illegal. An appeal was lodged against this ruling, and in a ruling of  December  the Labour Appeal Court of the City of Asuncin declared the invalidity of the proceedings. The application by the Attorney-General s Office demonstrates the Government s policy of anti-union intimidation and harassment. Furthermore, after the strike, deductions were made from the strikers' wages, even though the UNE SN had offered at the tripartite round table to make up the days in return for the non-deduction of wages ' a possibility that is provided for under section  of the Labour Code.(ii)	As a result of the strike, it was agreed that a tripartite round table would be set up with the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) to discuss the adoption of a collective agreement on working conditions in the sector. Although working sessions were held in October, November and December  and in January , since March  all work has been suspended without any explanation, which demonstrates the reluctance on the part of the authorities to reach a collective agreement. Furthermore, the UNE SN alleges that, in , no progress was made in respect of effective communication and joint work between the unions and the MEC. For instance, it points out that the Minister did not agree to hold any meetings with union officials in a year and that she issued decisions on matters affecting the education system and relating to competitive examinations without prior consultation.(iii)	In general, the UNE SN alleges anti-union harassment through repressive measures, which is demonstrated through accusations and sanctions against officials. In particular, it alleges that, at the end of , many trade union officials from other organizations were dismissed, most of whom had more than  years of service, mentioning in particular Ms Blanca Avalos (general secretary of the Organization of Education Workers of Paraguay National Trade Union (OTEP-SN)); Mr Marcos Gonzlez (general secretary of the Federation of Educators of Paraguay (FEP)); Mr Atilano Fleitas (FEP vice-president); Mr Carlos Parodi (FEP official); and Mr Javier Bentez (FEP official).
.In communications of  January and  August  and  March , the Government sent its observations on the Committee s recommendations and on the complainant organization s additional allegations.
.With regard to the Committee s previous recommendations, the Government states, in relation to suspending the deduction of several sets of union dues from one person, that: (i) this suspension is based on a legal restriction laid down in the Labour Code, section (c) of which provides that  each worker can become a member of only one trade union, in either their enterprise, industry, occupation or trade, or institution' which is why it is not feasible for the MEC to continue to deduct union dues in cases where workers are members of multiple unions; (ii) nevertheless, workers are free to join more than one union if they are from different enterprises, institutions or federations; (iii) the MEC has agreed to postpone the suspension measure in order to allow unionized workers to expressly and freely state their wish to belong to a particular trade union organization, and has already granted several extensions to regularize the situation (which shows that the MEC has involved the trade unions concerned); (iv) the MEC set up a clear procedure enabling workers who belong to multiple trade unions to choose one of them, and in cases where workers do not make their wishes known, the most recent trade union membership prevails, in accordance with the criteria established in the Electoral Code; and (v) the ban on joining more than one trade union is designed to prevent monopolization on the part of members and union fragmentation. Regarding the granting of trade union leave, the Government indicates that: (i) trade union leave is recognized in the Teachers' Statute, section  of which provides that in no case may trade union leave be granted to teachers who have been registered for less than five years; and (ii) Resolution No.  of  June , which is being challenged by the complainant organization and which governs the granting of trade union leave, was issued in accordance with the national legal framework.
.The Committee notes, in relation to its previous recommendations, that, with regard to suspending the deduction of several sets of union dues from one person, the Government confirms that this decision is based on the impossibility of joining more than one union, as laid down in section (c) of the Labour Code. While the Government states that in practice workers can belong to more than one trade union if these are from different institutions, the Committee recalls that the complaint concerned the non-deduction of trade union dues, through Decision No.  of  March  of the Legal Advisory Service of the Ministry of Education and Culture, due to the illegality of workers being members of multiple unions. The Committee also notes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has made the same observation in the context of the examination of the application by Paraguay of Convention No. . The Committee further notes that the restrictions on the granting of trade union leave alleged by the complainant organization, in particular the requirement that teachers must have been registered for five years, are also based on legislative provisions (section  of the Teachers' Statute). The Committee wishes to recall in this regard, as it did in its previous examination of the case, that establishing that teachers must have been registered for five years in order to obtain trade union leave raises problems of conformity with the principles of freedom of association. With regard to the apparent restrictions on multiple membership established in section (c) of the Labour Code, which apparently had an impact on the retention of union dues, and the requirements for the granting of trade union leave, in particular the requirement that teachers must have been registered for five years, the Committee again requests the Government to initiate social dialogue with the most representative organizations affected with a view to finding, including by making any amendments to the aforementioned laws that may be necessary, satisfactory solutions in terms of trade union leave and the deduction of trade union dues, in the light of the abovementioned principles of freedom of association. The Committee refers this legislative aspect of the case to the CEACR.
.Regarding the new allegations made by the complainant organization, the Government indicates, in relation to the application for the strike to be declared illegal, that: (i) the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic, together with the MEC, called for the four-day strike held in  to be declared illegal; (ii) in a ruling of  September , the Labour Court of First Instance decided to dismiss the objection that the application was time-barred and declared the strike illegal; (iii) in a ruling of  December , the Labour Appeal Court declared the invalidity of the proceedings that led to the strike being declared illegal, but in March  an appeal against this ruling was lodged with the Supreme Court of Justice; (iv) there is no intimidation or judicial harassment, but compliance with the country s constitutional and legal provisions, taking into consideration the general interests and the restrictions that by virtue thereof may be imposed on the constitutional right to strike; (v) in this regard, pursuant to section  of Act No. /, essential public services are considered to be  those whose total or partial interruption may endanger the life, health or safety of the whole community or",1,2014,Paraguay
22,"part of it'  and  education at all levels' is included in the list of such essential public services; and (vi) the employer has the legal right to withhold pay for days and hours not worked, regardless of the legality or illegality of the strike.
.The Committee notes that the question of the legality of the strike that was staged for a few days in  (the complainant alleges that it was for three days and the Government considers that it was for four) concerns the consideration of education ' at all levels ' as an essential public service, in relation to which there is a legal obligation to ensure its normal operation in the event of a strike. In this regard, the Committee recalls that the education sector does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term, although minimum services may be established in the education sector, in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strike of long duration [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the appeal against the ruling by the Labour Appeal Court (which invalidated the proceedings concerning the declaration of illegality of the strike) and requests that, through social dialogue, it take the measures that are necessary to ensure full respect for the abovementioned principles of freedom of association.
.Regarding the allegations of dismissals, the Government denies that they were anti-union in nature and provides the following information on the reasons for the dismissals: (i) Ms Blanca Avalos (general secretary of the OTEP SN) was dismissed for unjustified absence, abandonment of office and failure to comply with orders issued by her superiors, and an appeal has been filed against the measure before the ordinary courts; (ii) the FEP officials (Mr Marcos Gonzlez, Mr Atilano Fleitas, Mr Carlos Parodi and Mr Javier Bentez) were dismissed for having actively participated in a strike held from  July to  August , industrial action that was declared illegal by the ordinary courts. Regarding the dismissals for participation in  in a teachers' strike that was declared illegal, the Committee refers to the abovementioned principles on strikes in the education sector and recalls that no one should be penalized for carrying out or attempting to carry out a legitimate strike [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with these principles, including the compensation and reinstatement of the officials who were dismissed for participating in a teachers' strike, and to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any legal proceedings that are pending in relation to the alleged dismissals.
.Lastly, in its observations, the Government denies the assertions of the complainant organization alleging a lack of political will to conclude a collective agreement. The Government emphasizes in this respect that the collective agreement is something that is wanted and being promoted by the MEC, and states that since  it has been working with the unions, especially with the UNE SN, on projects aimed at entering into a collective agreement, and that the adoption of such an agreement will represent a milestone for labour relations in the country. The Government reports that the support of the ILO has been requested for these efforts. The Government also denies the allegations that there has been a lack of progress in effective communication and joint work, and the allegations of anti-union harassment. In this regard, the Government provides detailed information on the implementation of initiatives and activities that demonstrate the joint work that is being carried out by the MEC and the trade unions, including vocational and trade union training programmes organized jointly with the trade unions (and delivered to more than , teachers per month in  and ), as well as the creation of institutional round tables with the different trade union organizations to discuss issues of common interest such as salary adjustment or the teaching and administrative career. To sum up, regarding the allegations of denial of social dialogue and collective bargaining, while noting that the complainant organization alleges that since March  and for the rest of that year there was no progress in collective bargaining or in effective communication or joint work, the Committee notes that the Government emphasizes its commitment to enter into a collective agreement ' indicating that the ILO has been asked for support in this respect ' and describes in detail various joint initiatives and activities carried out with the trade unions in  and . The Committee encourages the authorities concerned to continue to promote social dialogue with the representative trade unions in the MEC, in particular with the complainant organization, and trusts that, in the very near future, a collective agreement on working conditions will be signed, and that any of the issues raised in this case that may still be pending can be addressed through this agreement. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the National Union of Teachers National Trade Union (UNE SN), dated  and  September , and  April , and in a communication from the Central Confederation of Workers Authentic (CUT A), dated  September . In its communication of  September , the organization Education International (EI) expressed its support for the claim lodged by UNE SN, which is affiliated to EI.
.In the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee was obliged to postpone its examination of the case. At its session in June  [see th Report, para. ], the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government indicating that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the requested information or observations had not been received in time. To date, the Government has not sent any information.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  August , UNE SN alleges that, by means of Resolution No.  of  June , the Paraguayan Ministry of Education and Culture terminated, in an arbitrary, non-consultative and unilateral manner, the granting of paid trade union leave to teachers with leadership positions in official trade union organizations. The UNE SN considers that the Resolution undermines the principles of freedom of association and the possibility of performing trade union duties: (i) by granting leave only to teachers who have been registered for five years (Article ), thus contradicting the provisions of the Labour Code which establish that the status of trade union officials is subject solely to the decisions made at trade union meetings and to trade union regulations; and (ii) by establishing that leave is granted  without prejudice to the duties performed' (Article ), which, according to the UNE SN, allows the employer or higher authority full discretion to grant leave. The UNE SN also alleges that Circular No. / of the Ministry of Education and Culture required workers who were on trade union leave when Resolution No.  was enacted to return to their posts at the corresponding educational institutions, and established that workers who did not comply with the orders would be subjected to administrative proceedings for dereliction of duty. Consequently, the majority of the UNE SN leaders who had been granted union leave returned to their workplaces and two officials (Mr Julio Rafael Bentez Gonzlez and Mr Juan Carlos Vera Snchez) were subjected to administrative proceedings, which the UNE SN considers is proof of the persecution of trade union officials. As a result of Resolution No. , the UNE SN believes that its organization does not have access to paid trade union leave, which is the only support for trade union organizations provided by the State. The UNE SN furthermore states that Resolution No.  violated agreements on the granting of leave which had been adopted since  between the Ministry and trade unions, in addition to various ministerial resolutions through which leave had been granted since that time. The UNE SN adds that, although the most recent leave granted was to expire on  December , it had been agreed that this leave would remain in effect until a consensus had been reached, which did not happen as the Ministry adopted Resolution No.  instead.
.In its communication of  September , the UNE SN includes as further proof of the violation of the principles of freedom of association Ministry of Education and Culture Resolution No.  of  September , which establishes that the staff at educational institutions attached to the Ministry would not be paid for the days and hours not worked during",-1,2014,Paraguay
23,"a strike that took place on '  August .
.In its communication of  September , the CUT A, which alleges the continued persecution of trade union leaders in the national education sector, states that the Government has reaffirmed the suspension of current trade union leave, and has demanded, under the threat of sanctions, that leaders come forward within  hours for job reassignment.
.In its communication of  April , the UNE SN alleges that Decision No.  of  March  of the Legal Advisory Service of the Ministry of Education and Culture establishes that the deduction of trade union dues is not feasible in cases where workers are members of multiple unions, which is against the law. This decision recommends that workers belonging to several trade unions be required to notify their membership of one trade union, and that the aforementioned deductions be suspended throughout the entire duration of the necessary procedures. The UNE SN considers that the decision violates the obligation of the authorities to refrain from any interference that may circumscribe the right to, and exercise of, freedom of association. The UNE SN underscores that, instead of seeking a solution with the affected trade unions and applying other criteria such as the most recent trade union membership, the Decision proposes an arbitrary solution which does not take into account time limits and procedures to be followed. The UNE SN concludes that the Ministry does not have the authority to suspend the deduction of periodical trade union dues without the involvement and consent of the affected parties.
.The Committee deeply regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the complaint was presented in , the Government has still not replied to the complainant organizations' allegations despite having been invited on several occasions to do so, including by means of an urgent appeal [see th Report, para. ]. In these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable procedural rules [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session ()], the Committee finds itself obliged to present, once again, a report on the substance of the case without being able to take into account the information it hoped to receive from the Government. The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom in law and in practice. The Committee remains confident that, while the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments, on their side, will recognize the importance of presenting, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations made against them [see First Report, para. ].
.The Committee notes the complainant organizations' allegations that Ministry of Education and Culture Resolution No.  unilaterally nullifies the right of teachers to trade union leave by requiring them to have been registered for five years and, by stating that leave is granted  without prejudice to the (work) duties performed'  it affords employers or higher authorities full discretion when granting leave. The Committee furthermore notes UNE SN s allegation that Decision No.  of  March  issued by the Legal Advisory Service of the Ministry of Education and Culture unilaterally establishes the suspension of deductions of trade union dues for workers who are members of more than one trade union.
.In the absence of any response from the Government to the allegations, the Committee wishes to stress that any changes to the scope and exercise of trade union rights should, as a matter of importance, be subject to in-depth consultations with the most representative organizations, in order to find, as far as possible, shared solutions. As regards the substantive issues highlighted in the allegations, the Committee considers that the content of the Resolution raises problems of conformity with the principles of freedom of association by establishing that teachers must have been registered for five years in order to obtain trade union leave and by apparently allowing the authorities excessive discretion when deciding whether to grant such leave. The Committee notes that the restrictions contained in Decision No.  of the Ministry s Legal Advisory Service on the deduction of union dues in cases of multiple membership are based on the impossibility, established in section (c) of the Labour Code, for workers, even if they have more than one employment contract, to become members of more than one trade union, in either their enterprise, industry, occupation or trade, or institution. This does not comply with the principles of freedom of association, as it unduly impedes the right of workers to join organizations of their own choosing. The Committee recalls that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made the same point when examining the application of Convention No.  by Paraguay.
.In this context, with regard to the issues raised in this complaint which relate to the aforementioned Resolution and Decision, the Committee requests the Government to initiate dialogue with the most representative organizations affected with a view to finding satisfactory solutions for both parties in terms of trade union leave and the deduction of trade union dues. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the allegations concerning the decision not to pay wages for the days and hours not worked during a strike in , the Committee recalls that  salary reductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of the principles of freedom of association' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not replied to the complainant organizations' allegations, despite having been invited on several occasions to do so and despite an urgent appeal in that respect. It therefore requests the Government to be more cooperative in the future.(b)	Observing that the content of the Resolution and the Decision, which are the subject of this complaint, raise problems of conformity with the principles of freedom of association, by establishing that teachers must have been registered for five years in order to obtain trade union leave, by apparently allowing for excessive discretion when granting such leave, and by suspending the deduction of trade union dues in cases of multiple trade union membership, the Committee requests the Government to initiate a dialogue with the most representative organizations affected, with a view to finding satisfactory solutions for both parties concerning trade union leave and the deduction of union dues. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",1,2014,Paraguay

.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  November ,  January and  February .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	Taking into account the fact that section  of the Labour Code, by requiring  per cent of workers to be affiliated in public sector institutions of up to  employees, could result in a requirement of up to  workers to establish a trade union, the Committee requests the Government to review this provision in consultation with the social partners concerned in order to not, in effect, undermine the right of public sector employees to establish and join organizations of their own choosing.(b)	The Committee urges the Government to provide detailed information on the alleged legal irregularities in the establishment of SINFAPAVI which led it to deny the union its final registration. Furthermore, in the light of the existence of numerous allegations of interference by management relying on legal provisions to challenge the final registration of unions, the Committee invites the Government to review on a tripartite basis without delay the use of employers' powers to contest the registration of unions.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the allegations of anti-union dismissals made against the MAEHARA and IPFSA enterprises. In this regard, taking account of the general nature of the allegations of anti-union discrimination it has received, the Committee invites the complainants to provide additional information so that it may examine those and other allegations of anti-union dismissals and discrimination in greater detail, and to seek the relevant additional observations from the Government.(d)	The Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners, to establish mechanisms to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, including rapid and impartial procedures, with provision for appeals and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(e)	The Committee firmly expects the Government to provide more information on the grounds for the detention of trade unionists protesting outside the premises of the MAEHARA enterprise, and to keep it informed of the outcome of the resultant proceedings.(f)	The Committee requests the Government to provide its observations on the following allegations to which it has yet to reply: () procedures of the labour authorities in the event of violations of labour or union rights involving a high degree of corruption and which last one year; failure to deal with complaints made by trade unions; and the labour inspectorate s conducting inspections without the participation of the unions; () the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register more than  per cent of the collective agreements in the public service; () the passive attitude of the labour authorities to the illegal replacement of striking workers by other workers; and () the cancellation of the registration of the Union of Workers of the DORAM SA Enterprise. Furthermore, the Committee invites the Government to address these issues in tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of employers and workers, and to keep the Committee informed in this regard.
.In a communication dated  July , the CUT A reported that Citibank (hereinafter, the bank) committed acts of anti-union discrimination against Mr Oscar Ricardo Paredes Drrling, who worked in the bank from  to  and was a member of the executive committee of the Union of Citibank Employees (SECP) (a union which ceased to exist in around ). The CUT A indicated that, in accordance with the pay adjustment mechanism agreed upon in the collective agreement on working conditions signed in  by the SECP, Mr Paredes Drrling s salary should have been automatically adjusted in accordance with the consumer price index. However, between  and  the real increase in Mr Paredes Drrling s salary was . per cent compared with an increase in the consumer price index of . per cent, and between October  and February  his salary remained unchanged. The complainant organization adds that on various occasions the bank tried to obtain his voluntary resignation, and that over the past  years he felt discriminated against and persecuted.
.The complainant organization indicates that on several occasions Mr Paredes Drrling requested the bank to readjust his salary as it had for the other employees whose salaries the bank had increased between  per cent and  per cent but that, following the bank s constant refusal to adjust his salary, on  August  Mr Paredes Drrling did not go to work and after  years of service terminated his contract on account of the failure to pay the corresponding salary. According to the complainant, section  of the Labour Code provides that failure to pay the corresponding salary at the agreed or usual time and place is a legitimate reason for termination by the worker s unilateral will. The bank ordered the worker to return to his post but he did not show up and on  August  he filed a claim against the bank demanding readjustment of his salary, regularization of pension payments and compensation for moral damages (verbal insults and social isolation). The bank, in turn, filed a case claiming compensation for unjustified resignation.
.The CUT A has appended the text of the request filed by Mr Paredes Drrling against the bank, as well as a copy of the first instance ruling issued on  April  by the third rota labour court, which states that: (i) the provision of the  collective agreement concerning salary readjustment is in force since it was incorporated into the complainant s labour contract; (ii) the bank is thereby ordered to pay compensation to the complainant for the amount claimed; (iii) the case filed by the bank claiming compensation for unjustified resignation is dismissed; and (iv) the request for reparation for failure to pay into the pension fund and compensation for moral damages is dismissed since the complainant did not prove that he had been a victim of bullying. Mr Paredes Drrling appealed this ruling and the case is currently pending before the First Chamber of the Labour Appeals Court.
.In a communication of  November , the Government replied to the new allegations of anti-union discrimination presented by the CUT A. The Government sent the bank and its own observations, according to which: (i) Mr Paredes Drrling s claim against the bank is currently pending before the First Chamber of the Labour Appeals Court and is reserved for judgement; (ii) the bank has not committed acts of anti-union discrimination given that the Paraguay branch does not have a workers' union; the last union stopped operations in around ; there is no record of Mr Paredes Drrling having been the leader of this union and he never invoked trade union status in the judicial proceedings that he himself launched; (iii) the bank did not readjust his salary in accordance with the  collective agreement because it was only in force until  and his salary could not be compared with that of his colleagues who hold different posts; and (iv) the bank did not dismiss Mr Paredes Drrling but rather he ordered the bank to pay a specific amount within  hours, as salary readjustment and damages, and resigned even before the end of the -hour period.
.The Government has appended various documents to its communication, including: (i) a copy of decision No.  of the Ministry of Labour dated  July  registering the members of the last executive committee of the SECP who were elected at the extraordinary general assembly on  April , who do not include Mr Paredes Drrling; and (ii) a copy of a report by the Department of Collective Relations and Trade Union Registration of the Ministry of Labour stating that the union has been  inactive' since .
.In its communications of  January and  February , the Government sent its observations on some of the recommendations made by the Committee in its previous examination of the case. With regard to recommendation (a) of the Committee (review section  of the Labour Code, in consultation with the social partners concerned, which requires that  per cent of workers be affiliated in public sector institutions of up to  employees, as this could result in a requirement of up to  workers to establish a trade union, thus undermining the right of public sector employees to establish organizations of their own choosing), the Government indicates that: (i) this section of the Labour Code has not been examined by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and",0,2013,Paraguay
25,"Recommendations (CEACR) in relation to the establishment of trade unions in the public sector; (ii) in order to avoid an excessively strict minimum threshold for public servants, national legislation fixes the percentage for public servants at a level that does not restrict the possibility for them to freely establish their organizations; and (iii) the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security has made a considerable effort to facilitate the establishment of trade unions, such as setting up an online trade union registration system to streamline the procedures the unions must follow.
.With regard to recommendation (b) of the Committee (detailed information on the alleged legal irregularities in the establishment of the Union of Workers of the Paraguayan Glass Factory (SINFAPAVI), which led the Government to deny the union its final registration and conduct a review on a tripartite basis of the use of employers' powers to contest the registration of unions), the Government indicates that while the Legal Adviser of the General Labour Directorate advised preliminary registration of SINFAPAVI, the enterprise representative objected to this registration on the grounds that: (i) the registration did not fulfil the official requirements of Chapter III of the Labour Code; (ii) the General-Secretary of the trade union had left the enterprise of his own volition and for personal reasons; and (iii) the union did not have the required number of members to establish a union. The Government emphasizes that the union officials refrained from responding to the objections raised and that, therefore, the registration of the union was not finalized. The Government also reports that, under Decree No.  of  April , a Tripartite Advisory Council was established, under the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which meets at least once a month to evaluate socio-economic and labour issues and make recommendations on questions relating to the competency of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security.
.With regard to recommendation (c) of the Committee, the Government has forwarded the observation of the MAEHARA enterprise, according to which the workers' employment was terminated owing to restructuring carried out by the enterprise to reduce its labour and align itself with environmental and technological standards. The enterprise also indicates that the workers received the corresponding compensation and that a judgement of payment on consignment was handed down for those who were refused their entitlements, whereby those wages were deposited in judicial accounts. According to the enterprise, the workers whose employment was terminated established a trade union immediately after being relieved of their posts and the request for registration of the union was refused by the administrative labour authorities because it did not meet the minimum number of members required under section  of the Labour Code ( members to establish an enterprise-level union).
.With regard to recommendation (d) of the Committee (consultations with the social partners to establish mechanisms to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination), the Government reports that, in April , a Memorandum of Commitment was signed between the public sector and the trade union federations and that round tables have been set up at which the trade union federations requested training on compliance with legislation on freedom of association. The Government therefore underlines that an online system for registering and updating data has been established enabling the trade unions to follow up cases and manage documents, thereby minimizing the red tape associated with those procedures.
.With regard to recommendation (e) of the Committee (information on the grounds for the detention of trade unionists protesting outside the premises of the enterprise), the Government has forwarded the enterprise s observations, which reveal that the arrests of Mr Leoncio Brtez, Mr Gustavo Adolfo Jara Aquino and Mr Teodoro Enciso were made, further to complaints submitted in April  to the national police, that these individuals had carried out acts of vandalism at the entrance to the enterprise, brandished wooden sticks, burned tyres and blocked access to the enterprise. The Government emphasizes that, as shown in the reports, police statement and arrest warrant of  April , the arrests were ordered for the alleged commission of crimes against the safe coexistence of people and for disturbance of the public peace, which have no bearing on trade union affairs. The Government has attached the reports of the Public Prosecution Service and the national police related to the criminal case before the court against the detainees.
.With regard to recommendation (f)() of the Committee (procedures of the labour authorities in the event of violations of labour or union rights involving a high degree of corruption, and which last one year; failure to deal with complaints made by trade unions; and the labour inspectorate s conducting inspections without the participation of the unions), the Government indicates that the reports and inspection requests made by the trade union organizations are followed up by issuing orders and when labour inspectors perform inspection duties in workplaces, they are accompanied by an employer representative and a union representative if there is one, or by the most senior worker in the enterprise, if the employer authorizes access for these officials to the workplace. The Government adds that one of its priorities is to modernize the labour inspectorate and increase the effectiveness of inspection procedures. In this connection, the Government reports that, in ,  new labour inspectors were recruited who were trained in areas relating to the Conventions ratified by the country. The Government further highlights that various measures have been implemented to combat corruption, such as the creation of a website for the submission of complaints concerning allegations of corruption that have an impact on public institutions and the establishment of the Anti-corruption and Transparency Directorate under the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security.
.With regard to recommendation (f)() of the Committee (the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register more than  per cent of the collective agreements in the public service), the Government indicates that: (i) the Civil Service Secretariat is empowered to certify and register collective agreements on working conditions in state bodies and undertakings where they meet the requirements of form and content for their validation; (ii) collective agreements should be in line with the terms under Act No. / on collective bargaining in the public sector; (iii) the draft collective agreements presented to the Civil Service Secretariat included benefits for public servants which were not subject to negotiation with the highest authority of the relevant institution, owing to which they could not be adopted; and (iv) public sector benefits are provided for in Act No. / and in the Act on the national general budget, and their inclusion in a collective agreement is therefore inappropriate since the public authorities are not legally competent to negotiate these issues.
.With regard to recommendation (f)() of the Committee (the passive attitude of the labour authorities to the illegal replacement of striking workers by other workers), the Government indicates that the labour inspectorate oversees the non-replacement of striking workers during the strike, which is reported and communicated to the Administrative Labour Authorities with a specific period of advance notice. Where a replacement is detected, management is informed and the case is referred to the legal adviser. The Government quotes the names of certain enterprises in which monitoring of replaced workers was conducted in  and .
.With regard to recommendation (f)() of the Committee (cancellation of the registration of the Union of Workers of the DORAM SA Enterprise), the Government indicates that while the enterprise representative raised objections to the establishment of the trade union, these were contested by the General-Secretary of the trade union and the legal adviser of the Ministry advised that the objections be dismissed and registration be finalized. However, following this, the members of the trade union executive committee (with the exception of the General-Secretary) expressed their wish to annul the final recognition of the trade union given that several of them had left the enterprise. Although the General-Secretary of the trade union urged that a decision be issued on the union s final recognition, the legal adviser of the Ministry recommended that the appellants' request be upheld and that the union s final registration be annulled. The General-Secretary of the trade union filed an appeal against this decision but subsequently withdrew it and hence the case was closed.
.The Committee recalls that this case concerns deficiencies in sanctions procedures of the labour inspectorate in relation to corruption practices, barriers to the creation of trade unions, dismissals of union leaders and members, obstacles to collective bargaining and anti-union discrimination.
.With regard to recommendation (a) (review section  of the Labour Code in consultation with the social partners concerned), the Committee notes the Government s indications that: (i) this section of the Labour Code has not been examined by the CEACR as it applies to the establishment of trade unions in the public sector; (ii) in order to avoid an excessively strict minimum threshold for public servants, national legislation fixes the percentage for public servants at a level that does not restrict the possibility for",-1,2013,Paraguay
26,"them to freely establish their organizations; and (iii) the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security has made a considerable effort to facilitate the establishment of trade unions, such as setting up an online trade union registration system to streamline the procedures the unions must follow. The Committee recalls that in this case it examined specific allegations on the way in which section  of the Labour Code undermines the rights of public sector workers' organizations and noted that a requirement that  per cent of workers be affiliated in public sector institutions of up to  employees could result in a requirement of up to  workers to establish a trade union, and that this could, in effect, undermine public sector workers' rights to establish organizations of their own choosing. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee once again requests the Government to hold consultations with the social partners concerned with a view to ensuring that section  of the Labour Code does not, in effect, undermine the right of public sector employees to establish organizations of their own choosing.
.With regard to recommendation (b) made during its last examination of the case (alleged legal irregularities in the establishment of SINFAPAVI which led the Government to deny the union its final registration), the Committee notes the Government s statement that although the Legal Adviser of the General Labour Directorate advised preliminary registration of the union, the enterprise raised objections on grounds that: (i) the registration did not fulfil the official requirements of Chapter III of the Labour Code; (ii) the General-Secretary of the trade union had left the enterprise of his own volition; and (iii) the union did not have the required number of members to establish a union. The Committee notes that the Government emphasizes that the union officials refrained from responding to the objections raised and that, therefore, the union s registration was not finalized. The Committee notes that the documents provided by the Government reveal that  members of the union gave up their membership of their own free will on  and  June , which is to say a few days before the union requested its registration from the General Labour Directorate. The Committee also notes that these voluntary membership withdrawals from SINFAPAVI made it possible for the enterprise to challenge the union s final registration.
.The Committee had also requested the Government in its recommendation (b) in the light of the existence of numerous allegations of interference by management relying on legal provisions to challenge the final registration of unions, to review on a tripartite basis the use of employers' powers to contest the registration of unions. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government reports that in April  the Tripartite Advisory Council was established under the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which meets at least once a month to evaluate socio-economic and labour issues and make recommendations on questions regarding the competency of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the tripartite discussions held in the Tripartite Advisory Council or in any other setting in relation to the use of employers' powers to contest the registration of unions.
.With regard to recommendation (c), the Committee notes the observations of the enterprise forwarded by the Government, according to which: (i) the workers' employment was terminated owing to restructuring carried out by the enterprise to reduce its labour; (ii) the workers received the corresponding compensation and a judgement of payment on consignment was handed down for those who were refused their entitlements, whereby those wages were deposited in judicial accounts; and (iii) the workers whose employment was terminated established a trade union immediately after being relieved of their posts, which could not be registered because it did not meet the minimum number of members required under section  of the Labour Code ( members to establish an enterprise-level union). The Committee, while noting the enterprise s observations, recalls that, taking account of the general nature of the allegations of anti-union discrimination raised, it had invited the complainants to provide additional information so that it may examine those and other allegations of anti-union dismissals and discrimination in greater detail, and to seek the relevant additional observations from the Government. Noting that the complainants have not provided such information, and that without it an in-depth examination of the allegations of anti-union dismissals is not possible, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.With regard to recommendation (d) (consultations with the social partners, to establish mechanisms to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination), the Committee notes the Government s indication that in April  a Memorandum of Commitment was signed between the public sector and the trade union federations, under which round tables on freedom of association had been set up at which the trade union federations had requested training on compliance with legislation on freedom of association. The Committee also notes that the Government underlines that an online system for registering and updating data has been established enabling the trade unions to follow up cases and manage documents, thereby minimizing red tape. Recalling that for many years the CEACR has been observing the need to strengthen the legal provisions against anti-union discrimination and that this Committee has in the past requested the Government  in consultation with the social partners, to ensure effective national procedures for the prevention and sanctioning of anti-union discrimination' [see Case No. , th Report, para. ], the Committee requests the Government to inform the CEACR, to which the legislative aspects of the case are referred, of the consultations held with the social partners to establish mechanisms to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, including rapid and impartial procedures, with provision for appeals and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions.
.With regard to recommendation (e), the Committee notes that the Government has forwarded the enterprise s observations, according to which the arrests of Mr Leoncio Brtez, Mr Gustavo Adolfo Jara Aquino and Mr Teodoro Enciso were made further to the complaints submitted in April  to the national police that these individuals had carried out acts of vandalism at the enterprise entrance, brandished wooden sticks, burned tyres and blocked access to the enterprise. The Government emphasizes that, as shown in the complaints, police statement and arrest warrant of  April , the arrests were ordered for the alleged commission of crimes against safe cohabitation of people and for disturbance of the public peace, which have no bearing on trade union affairs. Noting that, according to the reports of the Public Prosecution Service and the national police attached by the Government, the arrest warrant was issued on  April , the Committee urges the Government to indicate whether Mr Leoncio Brtez, Mr Gustavo Adolfo Jara Aquino and Mr Teodoro Enciso remain in detention, to specify the status of the criminal case against them and to forward a copy of the court rulings once they have been issued.
.With regard to recommendation (f)() of the Committee (procedures of the labour authorities in the event of violations of labour or union rights involving a high degree of corruption; failure to deal with complaints made by trade unions; and the labour inspectorate s conducting inspections without the participation of the unions), the Committee notes the Government s indication that labour inspectors perform inspection duties in workplaces accompanied by an employer representative and a trade union representative if there is one or by the most senior worker in the enterprise, if the employer authorizes access for these officials to the workplace. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, one of its priorities is to modernize the labour inspectorate and increase the effectiveness of inspection procedures and that in ,  new labour inspectors were recruited who were trained in areas relating to the Conventions ratified by the country. The Committee also notes the various measures implemented by the Government to combat corruption, such as the creation of a website for the submission of complaints concerning allegations of corruption affecting public institutions and the establishment of the Anti-corruption and Transparency Directorate under the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security.
.With regard to recommendation (f)() of the Committee (the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register more than  per cent of the collective agreements in the public service), the Committee notes the Government s indication that: (i) the Civil Service Secretariat is empowered to certify and register collective agreements on working conditions in state bodies and undertakings where they meet the requirements of form and content for their validation; (ii) collective agreements should be in line with the terms under Act No. / on collective bargaining in the public sector; (iii) the draft collective agreements presented to the Civil Service Secretariat included benefits for public servants which were not subject to negotiation with the highest authority of the relevant institution, owing to which they could not be adopted; and (iv) public sector",-1,2013,Paraguay
27,"benefits are provided for in Act No. / and in the Act on the national general budget, and their inclusion in a collective agreement is therefore inappropriate since the public authorities are not legally competent to negotiate these issues. In this respect, the Committee has considered that the exercise of financial powers by the public authorities in a manner that prevents or limits compliance with collective agreements already entered into by public bodies is not consistent with the principle of free collective bargaining [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee also recalls that, with regard to the requirement that draft collective agreements in the public sector must be accompanied by a preliminary opinion on their financial implications issued by the financial authorities, and not by the public body or enterprise concerned, the Committee noted that it was aware that collective bargaining in the public sector called for verification of the available resources in the various public bodies or undertakings, that such resources were dependent on state budgets and that the period of duration of collective agreements in the public sector did not always coincide with the duration of the State Budgetary Law ' a situation which could give rise to difficulties. The body issuing the above opinion could also formulate recommendations in line with government economic policy or seek to ensure that the collective bargaining process did not give rise to any discrimination in the working conditions of the employees in different public institutions or undertakings. Provision should therefore be made for a mechanism which ensured that, in the collective bargaining process in the public sector, both trade union organizations and the employers and their associations were consulted and could express their points of view to the authority responsible or assessing the financial consequences of draft collective agreements. Nevertheless, notwithstanding any opinion submitted by the financial authorities, the parties to collective bargaining should be able to conclude an agreement freely [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee invites the Government to examine this matter of collective agreements in the public sector with the social partners concerned in the light of the aforementioned principles.
.With regard to recommendation (f)() of the Committee (the passive attitude of the labour authorities to the illegal replacement of striking workers by other workers), the Committee notes the Government s indication that the labour inspectorate monitors the non-replacement of striking workers during the strike, which is reported and communicated to the Administrative Labour Authorities with a specific period of advance notice. Where a replacement is detected, management is informed and the case is referred to the legal adviser. The Government quotes the names of certain enterprises in which monitoring of replaced workers was conducted in  and .
.With regard to recommendation (f)() (cancellation of a union registration), the Committee notes the Government s indication that although the legal adviser of the Ministry advised that the objections raised by the enterprise should be dismissed and the trade union s registration should be finalized, several members of the executive committee of the trade union requested that the union s final recognition be annulled as they were no longer working in the enterprise. While the General Secretary of the union requested final recognition of the union, the legal adviser of the Ministry recommended that the appellants' request be upheld and that the union s final registration be annulled. The Committee notes that the General-Secretary of the union filed an appeal against that decision but subsequently withdrew it and hence the case was closed.
.With regard to the new allegations presented by the CUT A in its communication of  July , the Committee notes that these related to acts of anti-union discrimination against Mr Oscar Ricardo Paredes Drrling, who worked at the bank from  to  and was a member of the executive committee of the SECP (a union which, according to information in annexed documents, has been inactive since ). In particular, the complainant alleges that on various occasions the bank tried to obtain his voluntary resignation and that since , and unlike his colleagues, the bank did not readjust his salary in accordance with the consumer price index, thereby failing to comply with the  collective agreement. Following the bank s constant refusal to readjust his salary, on  August  Mr Paredes Drrling did not go to work and after  years of service terminated his contract on account of the failure to pay the corresponding salary. The bank ordered the worker to return to his post but he did not show up and on  August  he filed a claim against the bank demanding readjustment of his salary, regularization of pension payments and compensation for moral damages (verbal insults and social isolation).
.The Committee notes that, as indicated by the complainant and the Government: (i) in the judicial proceedings in question, the bank alleged that it was not appropriate to readjust salaries in accordance with the collective agreement because it was in force until  and that his salary cannot be compared with that of his colleagues, who hold different posts; (ii) in a ruling issued on  April , the labour court decided that the provision of the collective agreement concerning salary readjustment was in force since it had been incorporated into the complainant s labour contract and ordered the bank to pay him compensation for the amount claimed but dismissed the request for reparation for failure to pay into the pension fund and compensation for moral damages, since the complainant did not prove that he had been a victim of bullying; (iii) in these proceedings the complainant did not allege that the bank had discriminated on grounds of trade union membership or trade union activities; and (iv) Mr Paredes Drrling appealed this ruling and the case is currently pending before the Labour Appeals Court.
.The Committee notes that, while the complainant organization alleges that over the past  years, out of a total of  years of work, the bank did not readjust Mr Paredes Drrling s salary as it should have, and that on various occasions he felt discriminated against, the allegations and documents provided do not prove that the bank has discriminated on grounds of his trade union membership or that it refused to readjust his salary on account of his participation in trade union activities up to . The Committee also notes that in the proceedings before the labour courts, the complainant did not claim that the bank had discriminated on grounds of his trade union membership or trade union activities. In light of the foregoing, the Committee will not pursue the examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee once again requests the Government to hold consultations with the social partners concerned with a view to ensuring that section  of the Labour Code does not, in effect, undermine the right of public sector employees to establish organizations of their own choosing.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of tripartite discussions held in the Tripartite Advisory Council or in any other setting in relation to the use of employers' powers to contest the registration of unions.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to inform the CEACR, to which the legislative aspects of the case are referred, of the consultations held with the social partners to establish mechanisms to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, including rapid and impartial procedures, with provision for appeals and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions.(d)	The Committee urges the Government to indicate whether Mr Leoncio Brtez, Mr Gustavo Adolfo Jara Aquino and Mr Teodoro Enciso remain in detention, to specify the status of the criminal case against them and to forward a copy of the court rulings once they have been issued.(e)	The Committee invites the Government to examine the matter of collective agreements in the public sector with the social partners concerned in the light of the aforementioned principles.
.The complaint is contained in a communication by the National Confederation of Workers (CNT), the Single Authentic Confederation of Workers (CUT A) and the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of the Americas (CSA) dated  December . These organizations presented fresh allegations in a communication dated  May .
.The Government sent its partial observations in a communication dated  October .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  December  (received by the Office on  March ), the CNT, the CUT A and the CSA allege that the registration of the following trade unions was cancelled: () the Union of Workers of the Don Remigio Bakery (SITRAPAN); () the Union of Workers of the Paraguayan Glass Factory, SA (SINPAFAVI); () the Union of Health Workers of the Maternity and Paediatric Hospital of Limpio (SITRASALIM), a",1,2013,Paraguay
28,"hospital under the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Health; and () the Union of Workers of the MAEHARA Enterprise (SINTRAMAE). In all cases, the Ministry of Labour refused the final registration of the unions in response to objections from the employer.
.The complainants further allege that various enterprises dismissed a large number of union leaders and members or carried out other anti-union practices or obstructed collective bargaining: () the MAEHARA SA enterprise dismissed union leaders and members simply because they founded the union; the union members were detained by the police for protesting outside the enterprise s premises; () the refrigeration enterprise IPFSA does not recognize the union, dismissed its leaders and members, and refuses to negotiate a collective agreement; the dismissals, which resulted from demands to amend the collective agreement in force for workers of the Union of Workers of the Refrigeration Company (SITRAFIASA), affected all the union leaders and members, resulting in the disappearance of the trade union; () the PROSEGUR enterprise dismissed  workers for setting up a trade union and for demanding the right to bargain collectively; () the Grupo La Victoria enterprise dismissed the leaders and members simply because they founded a trade union; () the SAECA regional bank disregards freedom of association and refuses to sign the collective agreement; () the Social Action Secretariat (SAS) dismissed eight members of the executive committee of the Union of SAS Workers (SITRASAS); and () the multinational ESSO is seeking to destroy the union.
.The complainants add that, in the public service, over  per cent of collective agreements are not registered in practice, owing to the refusal of the Vice-Ministry of Labour to register them.
.In their communication dated  May , the complainants allege that, on repeated occasions, the labour administration of Paraguay has, through the General Directorate of Labour and the Department of Legal Affairs, required participants in union assemblies to attend in person to prove the validity of the signatures of those present, thereby completely undermining the union s autonomy. The Vice-Ministry of Labour and Social Security thus places in doubt the signatures of the participants in union assemblies. In many cases, those concerned have to travel from remote areas of the country to the capital, where the Vice Ministry s headquarters are located.
.The complainants state that the Union of Workers of the DORAM SA Enterprise obtained provisional registration by Resolution No.  of the administrative authority of the Vice Ministry of Labour and Social Security on  April . In violation of the prohibition on interference by employers in trade union organizations, the employer submitted objections to the labour administration and sought to cancel the union s registration, and the Ministry granted the request in an arbitrary manner. According to the allegations, the Minister of Labour has not yet provided any information on the issue, but workers have been dismissed.
.With regard to the right to strike, the complainants allege that the Vice-Ministry of Labour does not prevent the entry of workers to replace striking workers, hence employers hire replacements at will and strikes have no effect whatsoever. This is in violation of articles  and  of the Labour Code and the right to strike guaranteed by the national Constitution. In the event of a strike, the Vice-Ministry should guarantee that only formalized workers who are not participating in the strike are allowed to enter the workplace. The strikes called by the Union of Workers of the ALAMBRA SA Enterprise and the Union of Drivers of the Ciudad Villeta Enterprise illustrate this problem.
.Lastly, the complainants allege that, when labour inspectors inspect workplaces, they fail to verify the complaints made by union members concerning violations of labour or union rights, or they delay them arbitrarily in the Ministry s offices. Furthermore, procedures for administrative sanctions last one year and are subject to a high level of corruption.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government provides a partial reply to the complainants' allegations and transmits the replies of various enterprises concerned.
.On the subject of the denial of various unions' final registration, the Government reports that applications for registration are submitted for a period of  days, during which time objections may be made, and the labour administration subsequently decides whether to grant final registration. In the case of SITRAPAN, the owner of the enterprise submitted an objection to the provisional registration on the grounds that no employer employee relationship existed. The trade union was founded on  January  but, as a result of a public tendering process, all of the workers were on fixed-term contracts, which had ended on  November . The labour administration had notified the applicants of the objection but had not received any reply from them. Consequently, it decided not to approve the final registration of the trade union. In the case of SINFAPAVI, the enterprise objected that there had been irregularities in the establishment of the union. Having received no reply from the union, the labour administration considered that the legal requirements for the establishment of the union had not been fulfilled. In the case of SITRASALIM, the Government notes that the objections to its final registration were submitted not by the management, but by another trade union of the same institution, the Union of Workers of the District Hospital of Limpio (SITRALIMP), which alleged that documents had been submitted out of time and that some members were ineligible to join the union because they were civil servants who held positions of trust. Although the labour administration considered that SITRALIMP s objections could not form the basis of a challenge, it rejected the final registration of the union on the grounds that SITRASALIM did not comply with the legal requirements because: the articles of incorporation did not state the names of the founding members; the required minimum  per cent founding members in a public sector union in institutions of up to  employees was not met (only  persons of a total of  civil servants were recorded as having attended); and the documents submitted were wholly unclear as to the name of the union and used various formulations and acronyms. In the case of SINTREMAE, the MAEHARA enterprise objected that the union did not have the minimum number of members required by article  of the Labour Code ( members for enterprise trade unions). The labour administration had notified the applicant trade union of the objection and, as it had not received a reply, it considered that final registration should not be granted. The union s appeal was denied, as the administration s decision was final.
.As to the allegations of dismissals of trade union leaders and members by various enterprises for having established unions and conducted other union activities (the MAEHARA, Grupo La Victoria, PROSEGUR and SAS enterprises), the Government states that the administrative authorities are addressing all of the complaints received and are holding meetings to mediate between the parties. The Government transmits the information provided by the competent administrative authorities in relation to the cases and indicates the meetings and mediation attempts that have taken place. It appears from the documentation provided that an agreement was reached on two individual complaints made against the MAEHARA enterprise, with the offer of payment of accrued wages and of welfare benefits for unfair dismissal sought by the workers concerned. In most of the other cases reviewed by the administrative authorities, the meetings did not result in the resolution of the complaints. The Government also transmits information provided by some of the enterprises concerned. The Grupo La Victoria enterprise states that the reduction in workers as a result of shortages of raw materials had been communicated to the regional labour directorate and that at no point were trade unionists dismissed, given that the four workers who were dismissed were not unionized at the time and only joined the union after the fact. As to the allegations of anti-union dismissals by the SAS, the SAS states that the workers were not dismissed; instead, it had been decided that the contracts of a large number of workers would not be renewed and those affected received notice in accordance with the contract. The SAS also states that the majority of those workers were rehired, in particular the union leaders who enjoyed trade union immunity, and their status was applied. The SAS considers that the labour dispute was resolved as a result. With regard to the PROSEGUR enterprise, the Government states that the enterprise signed a collective agreement that was approved and registered by decision of  December , and that the alleged dismissal was the subject of legal proceedings and is before the Committee under Case No. .
.With regard to the alleged detention of trade unionists for protesting outside the premises of the MAEHARA enterprise, the Government requested a report from the national police force, and states that the leaders of the group of employees blocking the main entrance to the enterprise with pieces of wood were detained. The Government states that the",1,2013,Paraguay
29,"police asked them to go with them to the police station, where they were informed of their detention order in compliance with all legal safeguards, including communication with their lawyers. They were subsequently transferred to another police station, where they continued to communicate freely and were under the responsibility of the Public Prosecutor s Office.
.With regard to the allegations of obstructions to the signing of collective agreements, the Government provides information on the outcome of collective bargaining in certain enterprises. The SAECA regional bank, which had a collective agreement that was approved and registered in , negotiated a new collective agreement that was approved and registered by an administrative resolution of  January . The ESSO enterprise indicates in a communication dated  September  that it has always shown complete willing to engage in negotiations, that there has never been any obstacles to negotiating a collective agreement with the union and that consensus was reached on a preliminary collective agreement on  September . The refrigeration enterprise IPFSA states that it has not reviewed the draft collective agreement submitted by the union because it has, for several years, had fewer than  employees (with only  at the present time) and consequently does not meet the conditions of article  of the Labour Code for a collective agreement to be mandatory. In addition, this enterprise states that not one labour law violation has been determined in any of the inspections carried out in the enterprise.
.The Committee observes that the complainants allege that the labour administration denied the final registration of various trade unions without justification. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, in the case of the SITRAPAN union, the denial resulted from an objection from the owner, who alleged that there was no employment relationship as the contract of all of the workers had ended two months prior to the preliminary registration, that they were fixed-term workers as a result of a public tendering process, and that they had not challenged the objection when they had the opportunity to do so. In the case of SITRASALIM, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the labour administration denied the union s final registration owing to its non-compliance with the legal requirements concerning the inclusion of the names of the founding members, a lack of clarity as to the name of the trade union in the documents submitted, and non-compliance with the minimum number of members ' established in section  of the Labour Code as  per cent for the public sector in institutions of up to  employees. In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall the principle whereby  while a minimum membership requirement is not in itself incompatible with Convention No. , the number should be fixed in a reasonable manner so that the establishment of organizations is not hindered' and  what constitutes a reasonable number may vary according to the particular conditions in which a restriction is imposed' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. In the light of this principle, and taking into account the fact that section  of the Labour Code, by requiring  per cent of workers to be affiliated in public sector institutions of up to  employees, could result in a requirement of up to  workers to establish a trade union, the Committee requests the Government to review this provision in consultation with the social partners concerned in order to not, in effect, undermine the right of public sector employees to establish and join organizations of their own choosing. In the case of SINTRAMAE, the Committee observes that its final registration was denied because it did not have the minimum of  members required by section  of the Labour Code for enterprise trade unions. In the case of SINFAPAVI, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that registration was denied as a result of an objection from the enterprise, which alleged that there had been irregularities in the establishment of the union, but that it has not provided further details. The Committee therefore urges the Government to provide detailed information on the alleged legal irregularities in the establishment of SINFAPAVI which led it to deny the union its final registration. In the light of the numerous allegations of interference by management relying on legal provisions to object to the final registration of trade unions, the Committee invites the Government to review on a tripartite basis without delay the use of employers' powers to contest the registration of unions.
.The Committee observes that the complainants make various allegations of dismissals of trade union leaders and members as a result of their having established unions and conducted other trade union activities. The Committee observes that the complainant provided a list of the trade unionists purportedly dismissed by the SAS, but did not provide names or other precise information concerning the other alleged dismissals in the other enterprises. Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government has provided information on various complaints made against some of those enterprises, and indicates that the administrative authorities are handling the complaints and holding meetings to mediate between the parties. In this connection, recalling that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for many years been observing the need to strengthen legal provisions against anti-union discrimination, and that this Committee has in the past requested  the Government, in consultation with the social partners, to ensure effective national procedures for the prevention and sanctioning of anti-union discrimination' [see Case No. , th Report, para. ], the Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners to establish mechanisms to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, including rapid and impartial procedures, with provision for appeals and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee also notes in relation to the alleged dismissals by Grupo La Victoria that the enterprise states that the dismissals resulted from a shortage of raw materials, that the regional labour directorate had been informed, and that no trade unionists were dismissed, but that the dismissed workers had joined the union subsequently. With regard to the allegations of anti-union dismissals by the SAS, the Committee notes the explanations of the SAS that the situation was one of expiry and non-renewal of contracts and that the contracts of all union leaders enjoying trade union immunity were later renewed, as were the contracts of most of the workers affected by the non-renewal. With regard to the allegations of anti-union dismissals by the PROSEGUR enterprise, the Committee refers to its examination of the allegations in Case No.  [see th Report, paras ' ]. With regard to the allegations of anti-union dismissals by the IPFSA and MAEHARA enterprises, the Committee observes that the Government refers to the dismissal cases of two employees of the MAEHARA enterprise, who reportedly reached an agreement including compensation, but it is not possible to determine whether those workers were trade union members. As to the IPFSA enterprise, it merely states that no labour law violations have been established in any of the inspections conducted at the request of the union. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government to provide further information on the allegations of anti-union dismissals made against the MAEHARA and IPFSA enterprises. In this regard, and taking into account the general nature of the allegations of anti-union discrimination it has received, the Committee invites the complainants to provide additional information so that it may examine those and other allegations of anti-union dismissals and discrimination in greater detail, and to seek the relevant additional observations from the Government.
.With regard to the allegation that the ESSO enterprise is seeking to destroy the union, the Committee observes that the complainants do not provide precise information or evidence to substantiate the allegation. The Committee further observes that the enterprise states that it has always shown complete willingness to engage in negotiations and that consensus has been reached on a preliminary collective agreement.
.With regard to the allegations of the detention of trade unionists protesting outside the premises of the MAEHARA enterprise, the Committee notes that the Government states that their detention complied with all procedural guarantees, but does not state the grounds for the order to detain them. The Committee firmly expects the Government to provide more information on the grounds for the detention and to keep it informed of the outcome of the resultant proceedings.
.With regard to the allegations of obstructions to collective bargaining, the Committee observes that the complainants have not provided precise arguments or evidence concerning the alleged violations of the right to bargain collectively, and notes the information provided by the Government on the outcomes of negotiations in specific enterprises. The Committee notes that the Banco Regional SA negotiated and registered a new collective agreement in ; that the ESSO enterprise provides information on progress in",-1,2013,Paraguay
30,"the negotiation of a collective agreement; and that the refrigeration enterprise IPFSA has not engaged in collective bargaining because it has fewer employees than the statutory minimum of  employees as of which a collective agreement becomes mandatory.
.The Committee notes with regret that the Government has not sent its observations on the allegation concerning the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register more than  per cent of the collective agreements in the public service, or on the complainants' additional allegations dated  May  (see paras '  above). Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations on the following allegations to which it has yet to reply: () procedures of the labour authorities in the event of violations of labour or union rights involving a high degree of corruption and which last one year, failure to deal with complaints made by trade unions, and the labour inspectorate s conducting inspections without the participation of the unions; () the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register more than  per cent of the collective agreements in the public service; () the passive attitude of the labour authorities to the illegal replacement of striking workers by other workers; and () the cancellation of the registration of the Union of Workers of the DORAM SA Enterprise. Furthermore, the Committee invites the Government to address these issues in tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of employers and workers, and to keep the Committee informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:Taking into account the fact that section  of the Labour Code, by requiring  per cent of workers to be affiliated in public sector institutions of up to  employees, could result in a requirement of up to  workers to establish a trade union, the Committee requests the Government to review this provision in consultation with the social partners concerned in order to not, in effect, undermine the right of public sector employees to establish and join organizations of their own choosing.The Committee urges the Government to provide detailed information on the alleged legal irregularities in the establishment of SINFAPAVI which led it to deny the union its final registration. Furthermore, in the light of the existence of numerous allegations of interference by management relying on legal provisions to challenge the final registration of unions, the Committee invites the Government to review on a tripartite basis without delay the use of employers' powers to contest the registration of unions.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the allegations of anti-union dismissals made against the MAEHARA and IPFSA enterprises. In this regard, taking account of the general nature of the allegations of anti-union discrimination it has received, the Committee invites the complainants to provide additional information so that it may examine those and other allegations of anti-union dismissals and discrimination in greater detail, and to seek the relevant additional observations from the Government.(d)	The Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners, to establish mechanisms to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, including rapid and impartial procedures, with provision for appeals and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions.

Furthermore, the Committee invites the Government to address these issues in tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of employers and workers, and to keep the Committee informed in this regard.",-1,2013,Paraguay
31,".The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see st Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations [see st Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take urgent steps to ensure that an investigation is conducted without delay into all the allegations made in this case and, if these are found to be true, that the necessary remedy measures are taken. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) Recalling that measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements, the Committee requests the Government to do everything in its power to promote collective bargaining between the parties. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.
.The complainants' allegations referred to in recommendation (a) are reproduced below [see st Report, paras ' ]:' In their communication of  October , SITEPROPASA and UNI Global Union report that, on  September , a meeting of the constituent assembly of the trade union was called, at which the procedures for registering the trade union with the administrative labour authority were initiated. On  September, the trade union was registered in accordance with Resolution No. / of the Office of the Deputy Minister for Labour of Paraguay. The enterprise Prosegur Paraguay, SA was informed of this by telegram. The complainants allege that once the enterprise had been informed of the establishment of the trade union, it dismissed the following workers, who it identified as promoters and organizers within the trade union: Mr Vctor Fretes, Mr Po Antonio Hermoza, Mr Carlos Denis and Mr Esteban Gonzlez, the press and public relations secretary. The complainants state that it was not possible to bring a case before the courts requesting their reinstatement, as they did not possess reliable documentation to corroborate their status as union organizers.' The complainants add that, on  December , the trade union informed the employer of its intention to promote the negotiation of a collective agreement on working conditions and submitted a draft that had been approved by the assembly of the trade union. According to the complainants, the enterprise employed delaying tactics and the trade union turned to the administrative authority, requesting it to mediate. They state that, on  May , representatives of the enterprise and the trade union signed an initial agreement establishing a period of two months at the end of which both parties would sign the collective agreement on working conditions, once the negotiations were complete. The complainant organizations allege that, once the period of two months had elapsed, the agreement was never signed owing to the enterprise s unwillingness to continue with the negotiations.' The complainants allege that, during the negotiating process, the following trade union members were dismissed: Mr Antonio Robledo, Mr Hermenegildo Areco, Mr Vctor Martnez, Mr Heriberto Ortiz and Mr Alfredo Ramrez. The complainants state that, in this context, the workers who were members of SITEPROPASA, satisfying all the legal requirements, decided to hold an eight-day strike from  to  July  (the strike was extended to  August ). The complainants allege that the enterprise carried out acts of persecution and intimidation against the workers from the beginning of the strike. In particular, they state that several trade union leaders and members received telephone calls at home from employees of the enterprise, who informed their families that any worker who participated in the strike would be dismissed and would no longer be able to support their family. Furthermore, they allege that law enforcement officers were present at the picket line and marches, in order to intimidate the strikers.' The complainants add that the enterprise recruited new workers during the strike, which was confirmed by the administrative labour authority. They indicate that, during the strike, a tripartite meeting was held at the Ministry of Labour, which was attended by the Minister for Labour herself and at which the workers were requested and advised to end their protest action. According to the complainants, the highest authorities of the Ministry undertook to continue mediating between the parties and to guarantee that the workers would not suffer reprisals. However, the complainants allege that from that moment the authorities abandoned the workers who were members of the trade union to their fate. The complainants state that the workers decided to end the strike on  July  and that, when they returned to work on  July, they were summoned individually by the enterprise and, in the absence of an adviser or legal representative, were informed of the enterprise s intention to have the strike declared unlawful (the enterprise submitted a request to the Fourth Circuit Labour Court of First Instance of the city of Asuncin to that end), which would result in them being dismissed without pay. The complainants add that, in this context, the workers were pressured into signing an agreement that would terminate their employment contracts and which established the compensation to be paid, the notice period and other particulars, as if it were an unjustified dismissal or a justified withdrawal from service. The complainants allege that, in this way, the enterprise succeeded in dismissing  trade union members, and that those workers who had refused to sign the letters terminating their employment relationship were dismissed. The complainants state that it is worth noting that the enterprise subsequently withdrew on  August  its request to have the strike declared unlawful. According to the complainants, a number of trade union leaders accepted compensation as  an agreement to terminate their employment relationship by mutual consent'  which many only accepted after having been subjected to undue pressure. The complainants also allege that, when those dismissed workers seek employment in other enterprises in the sector, to their surprise, and despite meeting all the necessary criteria, they are informed that they cannot be hired because Prosegur Paraguay, SA has published a list containing the names of the striking workers.
.In a communication dated  June , the Government sent its observations, including the reports and decisions of the labour administrative authority, as well as the comments of the Prosegur Paraguay, SA enterprise on the allegations made by the complainants. The documents submitted relate to the following matters: the registration of the Trade Union of Workers and Employees of Prosegur Paraguay, SA (including Resolution No.  of  October  and Resolution No.  of  September , Opinion No. / of  December  and Opinion No. / of  November , and the record of  November ); the dismissal of workers prior to the conclusion of negotiations (including form No. / concerning the complaint of the failure to provide work made by Mr Heriberto Albino Ortiz and others dated  May , the notification papers dated  and  May , and the minutes of the meeting held on  May  with the acting mediator); the registration of the collective agreement on conditions of work (CCCT) signed on  October  (including Decision No.  of  December  and Decision No.  of  February  issued by the labour administrative authority, and the text of the collective agreement); the declaration of  July  concerning strike action from  to  July  by the Trade Union of Workers and Employees of Prosegur Paraguay, SA (SITEPROPASA) (including the text of the declaration and the minutes of the tripartite meetings held on ,  and  July ); the summary administrative procedure for the replacement of the striking workers (including Decision No. / of  August  and Decision No. / of  November ); and the dismissal of the workers who took part in the strike (including the response to the reinstatement claim submitted by a number of workers).
.The enterprise considers that the points made in the complaint do not correspond to the reality of the situation and states that it has respected the legislation in force, as well as adopting a conciliatory attitude. Moreover, in support of these statements, it points out that it pays the most competitive wages in the sector in Paraguay; a collective agreement is in force; and harmonious labour relations are ensured in the enterprise, the workers enjoying all the rights conferred by the legislation and the collective agreement. The enterprise also emphasizes that, despite there being no trade union at the enterprise, the collective",0,2012,Paraguay
32,"agreement was negotiated and signed by the representatives of almost the entire workforce, who had endorsed their representative status.
.With regard to the delay in the negotiation of the collective agreement relating to conditions of work, the Government sent information showing that the CCCT of  October  between Prosegur Paraguay, SA and the representatives of the workers is in force. This agreement was approved, certified and registered by the labour administrative authority by means of Decision No.  of  December . Further to a request made by the enterprise dated  December , the abovementioned decision was amended by Decision No.  of  February  in order to reflect the fact that the agreement had been signed between the enterprise and representatives of all the non-unionized workers.
.With regard to the strike held in , the Government sent a copy of the records of the tripartite meetings held on ,  and  July  as a result of the notification of strike action by SITEPROPASA and the subsequent extension thereof. The meetings were attended by representatives of the labour administrative authority, the enterprise and SITEPROPASA, but no consensus was reached. The enterprise indicates that there had been peaceful negotiations that year with a company trade union with a view to the adoption of a collective agreement, which was subsequently approved. The enterprise points out that it had been agreed that the parties would negotiate the terms of the collective agreement during May and June and that they would sign it, with the approved provisions, in July. However, instead of signing the final instrument, a minority of the workers at the office of Prosegur Paraguay, SA ( per cent) belonging to the said union announced a strike, on the grounds that the enterprise was supposedly refusing to sign the collective agreement.
.As regards the replacement of the striking workers, the information supplied by the Government shows that, in the context of the summary administrative procedure ordered by the Office of the Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Security by means of Decision No. / of  August , it was not established that services had been provided during the strike by workers who did not belong to the permanent workforce of the enterprise. Decision No.  of  November  ruled that, since there was insufficient evidence to warrant the imposition of penalties for alleged infringements of the labour laws, the summary administrative procedure against the enterprise should be dismissed.
.As regards the dismissal of the workers who took part in the strike, the enterprise explains that, on  July , the trade union assembly decided to end the strike and that the workers opted individually to continue their employment contracts or negotiate the termination thereof with the enterprise. The enterprise adds that it paid the maximum compensation provided for under the labour legislation to the  workers who chose the second option. The contract termination agreements were settled and formalized the following day, in the presence of notaries and other work colleagues, according to the order of arrival of the workers. The enterprise states that it is untrue that legal or union advisers were not permitted to be present during the formalization of the agreements. Moreover, the information supplied by the Government includes a report dated  April  from the Department for the Registration of Employers and Workers, in which there is no mention of the dismissal of workers from the enterprise.
.With regard to the request submitted by the enterprise to the Fourth Circuit Labour Court of First Instance on  July  to have the strike declared unlawful, the enterprise states that the request was submitted after all the possibilities for reopening negotiations in relation to the collective agreement had been exhausted. The enterprise indicates that once the dispute had been settled it withdrew its request, thereby showing that the dispute was forgotten and that it was keen to restore harmonious labour relations.
.The enterprise declares that it has not committed any act of anti-union persecution before, during or after the abovementioned strike, nor has it engaged in any  blacklisting'  let alone any bribery of officials.
.The Committee recalls that the present case is concerned with allegations that the Prosegur Paraguay, SA enterprise: () dismissed four founding members of the trade union when the enterprise was informed of the establishment thereof; () refused to comply with the initial agreement for negotiating a collective agreement relating to conditions of work; () dismissed five trade union members during the negotiation process; () replaced striking workers and carried out acts of intimidation against them (the complainants allege that the workers received phone calls at home informing their families that they would lose their jobs for taking part in the strike, and that law enforcement officers were present during the picketing and marches carried out by the strikers); () terminated the employment of  trade union members (who accepted compensation) who had taken part in the strike, after informing them that the strike would be declared unlawful and they would be dismissed without pay; and () sent a list containing the names of the striking workers to other enterprises in the sector, thereby preventing them from finding employment.
.The Committee notes the observations sent by the Government and the comments from the enterprise in reply to the complainants' allegations. In particular, the Committee takes note of the documents submitted in relation to: the registration of the Trade Union of Workers and Employees of Prosegur Paraguay, SA (SITEPROPASA); the dismissal of workers prior to the conclusion of negotiations; the registration of the collective agreement on conditions of work (CCCT) signed on  October ; the declaration of  July  concerning strike action from  to  July  by SITEPROPASA; the summary administrative procedure for the replacement of the striking workers; and the dismissal of the workers who took part in the strike.
.The Committee observes, with regret, that the Government s reply does not address the allegations made concerning the dismissal of four founding members of the trade union when the enterprise was informed of its establishment. The Committee therefore firmly urges the Government once again to provide information on the urgent steps that it requested the Government to take to ensure that an investigation is conducted into the allegations of dismissal and, if these prove to be true, that the necessary remedial measures are taken.
.As regards the alleged dismissals of Mr Antonio Robledo, Mr Hermenegildo Areco, Mr Vctor Martnez, Mr Heriberto Ortiz and Mr Alfredo Ramrez during the negotiations for the collective agreement on conditions of work, the Committee observes that, even though the Government does not address the allegations made, the documents that it sent contain references to the complaint of the failure to provide work made on  May  by Mr Heriberto Ortiz and others. The Committee further observes that, in the record of the meeting of  July  ( p.m.) between representatives of the labour administrative authority, the National Confederation of Workers (CONAT) and SITEPROPASA, at which no representative of the enterprise was present, it is noted that  ...while the negotiations for the CCCT were still in progress, a number of workers were dismissed, including Mr Antonio Robledo, Mr Hermenegildo Areco, Mr Vctor Martnez, Mr Heriberto Ortiz and Mr Alfredo Ramrez; it was requested that they be reinstated once the required procedures had been completed  ? The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the administrative procedure referred to above and to send a copy of any decision taken.
.As regards recommendation (b) in the previous examination of the case, and more specifically the delays in collective bargaining with the trade union SITEPROPASA since September , the Committee notes that, according to the information supplied by the Government, the CCCT in force is the one that was signed on  October  between the enterprise and the representatives of the workers, was approved, certified and registered by the labour administrative authority by means of Decision No.  of  December , and was subsequently amended by Decision No.  of  February  in order to reflect the fact that the CCCT had been signed between the enterprise and representatives of all the non-unionized workers. The Committee observes that the complainants' allegation is not concerned with the collective agreement signed with representatives of the workers but with the fact that the enterprise had been previously negotiating with SITEPROPASA. In a request from the enterprise dated  December , relating to an administrative decision (No.  of  December ), which is included in the documents sent by the Government, it is stated that  ...the representatives of the workers were appointed by an official letter dated  October , in accordance with sections  and  and related provisions of the Labour Code; moreover, other workers on other dates endorsed the actions of the representatives through documents that were attached to this file  ? The Committee also observes that these",0,2012,Paraguay
33,"(non-union) representatives were appointed after the end of the strike and the series of dismissals alleged by the complainants. The Committee wishes to recall that the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ), provides that:  For the purpose of this Recommendation, the term  collective agreements' means all agreements in writing regarding working conditions and terms of employment concluded between an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers' organisations, on the one hand, and one or more representatives workers' organisations, or in the absence of such organisations, the representatives of the workers duly elected and authorised by them, in accordance with national laws and regulations, on the other.' In this respect, the Committee has emphasized that the said Recommendation stresses the role of workers' organizations as one of the parties in collective bargaining. Direct negotiation between the undertaking and its employees, by-passing representative organizations where these exist, might in certain cases be detrimental to the principle that negotiation between employers and organizations of workers should be encouraged and promoted. [See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.With regard to the replacement of the striking workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government s information, in the context of the summary administrative procedure ordered by the Office of the Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Security, it was not established that services had been provided during the strike by workers who did not belong to the permanent workforce of the enterprise, and hence it was decided to dismiss the procedure against the enterprise. This being the case, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the alleged termination of the employment contracts of  workers who took part in the strike, the Committee notes the enterprise s statement that on  July  the trade union assembly decided to end the strike and that the workers opted individually to continue their employment contracts or negotiate the termination thereof with the enterprise;  workers (not  as alleged in the complaint) chose the second option (according to the enterprise, the termination of employment agreements were settled and formalized the following day, in the presence of notaries and other work colleagues; moreover, the enterprise denies that legal or union advisers were not permitted to be present during the formalization of the agreements). The Committee observes that the documents sent by the Government include the response to a court action for reinstatement brought by a number of workers (Mr Mario Arturo Lomaquiz Godoy and others), alleging deceit or extortion on the part of the enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings and to send a copy of any ruling issued.
.In this respect, as regards the alleged acts of persecution against the striking workers, the Committee notes the enterprise s statement that it has not committed any act of anti-union persecution or engaged in any  blacklisting'  The Committee urges the Government to carry out an administrative investigation into these allegations without delay, and, in the event that acts of anti-union discrimination have occurred, to impose the sanctions provided by legislation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee observes with regret that the Government s reply does not address the allegations made concerning the dismissal of four founding members of the trade union when the Prosegur Paraguay, SA enterprise was informed of the establishment thereof. The Committee therefore firmly urges the Government once again to keep it informed of the urgent steps that it requested the Government to take to ensure that an investigation is conducted into the allegations of dismissal and, if these prove to be true, that the necessary remedial measures are taken.(b) With regard to the alleged dismissals of five trade union members during the negotiations for the collective agreement on conditions of work, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the administrative procedure referred to above and to send a copy of any decision taken.(c) With regard to the alleged termination of the employment contracts of  workers who took part in the strike, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these judicial proceedings (the court action brought by Mr Mario Arturo Lomaquiz Godoy and others) and to send a copy of any ruling issued.(d) The Committee also urges the Government to carry out an administrative investigation into the allegations of persecutions against striking workers without delay and, in the event that acts of anti-union discrimination have occurred, to impose the sanctions provided by legislation.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Workers and Employees of Prosegur Paraguay, SA (SITEPROPASA) and UNI Global Union dated  October .
.At its October  meeting, the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government, indicating that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it could present a report on the substance of the case, even if the requested information or observations from the Government had not been received in time. In a communication dated  March , the Government informs that it will provide documents and reports related to the case.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  October , SITEPROPASA and UNI Global Union report that, on  September , a meeting of the constituent assembly of the trade union was called, at which the procedures for registering the trade union with the administrative labour authority were initiated. On  September, the trade union was registered in accordance with Resolution No. / of the Office of the Deputy Minister for Labour of Paraguay. The enterprise Paraguay, SA was informed of this by telegram. The complainants allege that once the enterprise had been informed of the establishment of the trade union, it dismissed the following workers, who it identified as promoters and organizers within the trade union: Mr Vctor Fretes, Mr Po Antonio Hermoza, Mr Carlos Denis and Mr Esteban Gonzlez, the press and public relations secretary. The complainants state that it was not possible to bring a case before the courts requesting their reinstatement, as they did not possess reliable documentation to corroborate their status as union organizers.
.The complainants add that, on  December , the trade union informed the employer of its intention to promote the negotiation of a collective agreement on working conditions and submitted a draft that had been approved by the assembly of the trade union. According to the complainants, the enterprise employed delaying tactics and the trade union turned to the administrative authority, requesting it to mediate. They state that, on  May , representatives of the enterprise and the trade union signed an initial agreement establishing a period of two months at the end of which both parties would sign the collective agreement on working conditions, once the negotiations were complete. The complainant organizations allege that, once the period of two months had elapsed, the agreement was never signed owing to the enterprise s unwillingness to continue with the negotiations.
.The complainants allege that, during the negotiating process, the following trade union members were dismissed: Mr Antonio Robledo, Mr Hermenegildo Areco, Mr Vctor Martnez, Mr Heriberto Ortiz and Mr Alfredo Ramrez. The complainants state that, in this context, the workers who were members of SITEPROPASA, satisfying all the legal requirements, decided to hold an eight-day strike from  to  July  (the strike was extended to  August ). The complainants allege that the enterprise carried out acts of persecution and intimidation against the workers from the beginning of the strike. In particular, they state that several trade union leaders and members received telephone calls at home from employees of the enterprise, who informed their families that any worker who participated in the strike would be dismissed and would no longer be able to support their family. Furthermore, they allege that law enforcement officers were present at the picket line and marches, in order to intimidate the strikers.
.The complainants add that the enterprise recruited new workers during the strike, which was confirmed by the administrative labour authority. They indicate that, during the strike, a tripartite meeting was held at the Ministry of Labour, which was attended by the Minister for Labour herself and at which the workers were requested and advised to end their protest action. According to the complainants, the highest authorities of the Ministry undertook to continue mediating between the parties and to guarantee that the workers would not suffer reprisals. However, the complainants allege that from that moment the authorities abandoned the workers who were members of the trade union to their fate. The",1,2012,Paraguay
34,"complainants state that the workers decided to end the strike on  July  and that, when they returned to work on  July, they were summoned individually by the enterprise and, in the absence of an adviser or legal representative, were informed of the enterprise s intention to have the strike declared unlawful (the enterprise submitted a request to the Fourth Circuit Labour Court of First Instance of the city of Asuncin to that end), which would result in them being dismissed without pay. The complainants add that, in this context, the workers were pressured into signing an agreement that would terminate their employment contracts and which established the compensation to be paid, the notice period and other particulars, as if it were an unjustified dismissal or a justified withdrawal from service. The complainants allege that, in this way, the enterprise succeeded in dismissing  trade union members, and that those workers who had refused to sign the letters terminating their employment relationship were dismissed. The complainants state that it is worth noting that the enterprise subsequently withdrew on  August  its request to have the strike declared unlawful. According to the complainants, a number of trade union leaders accepted compensation as  an agreement to terminate their employment relationship by mutual consent'  which many only accepted after having been subjected to undue pressure. The complainants also allege that, when those dismissed workers seek employment in other enterprises in the sector, to their surprise, and despite meeting all the necessary criteria, they are informed that they cannot be hired because Prosegur Paraguay, SA has published a list containing the names of the striking workers.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the beginning of the case, the Government has not provided the information requested, despite having been invited to do so by means of three urgent appeals (the last one having been made at its October  meeting).
.Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body], the Committee finds itself obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without the benefit of the information that it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom in law and in fact. The Committee remains confident that, if the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations made against them.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege that the enterprise Prosegur Paraguay, SA: () dismissed four founding members of the trade union when the enterprise was informed of its establishment; () refused to comply with the initial agreement for negotiating a collective agreement on working conditions; () dismissed five trade union members during the negotiation process; () replaced striking workers and carried out acts of intimidation against them (the complainants allege that the workers received telephone calls at home informing their families that they would lose their jobs for participating in the strike, and that law enforcement officers were present at the picket line and marches carried out by the strikers); () it succeeded in dismissing  trade union members (who accepted compensation) who had participated in the strike, after having informed them that the strike would be declared unlawful and that they would be dismissed without pay; and () it submitted a list containing the names of the striking workers to other enterprises in the sector, thereby preventing them from gaining employment.
.In this respect, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on these serious allegations of anti-union discrimination and urges it to send them without delay, after obtaining the observations of the enterprise concerned. The Committee wishes to recall that, in general,  no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment'  and that  all practices involving the blacklisting of trade union officials or members constitute a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union rights and, in general, governments should take stringent measures to combat such practices' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ].
.In the light of the above principles, the Committee requests the Government to take urgent steps to ensure that an investigation is conducted without delay into all the allegations made in this case and, if these are found to be true, that the necessary remedial measures are taken. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.
.Furthermore, recalling that  measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], the Committee requests the Government to do everything in its power to promote collective bargaining between the parties. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take urgent steps to ensure that an investigation is conducted without delay into all the allegations made in this case and, if these are found to be true, that the necessary remedy measures are taken. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) Recalling that measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements, the Committee requests the Government to do everything in its power to promote collective bargaining between the parties. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.",1,2012,Paraguay
35,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee invites the Government to institute an investigation, through the labour inspectorate, into the alleged failure to comply with the collective agreement for the period '  to which the complainant organizations refer and to keep it informed of the outcome without delay.(b)	With regard to the allegation that the enterprise has opposed the establishment of the bi-national joint conciliation committee even though an agreement signed by Brazil and Paraguay provides for its establishment, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to this allegation and requests to be kept informed in that regard.
.In its communication of  October , the Government provides information and detailed documentation concerning these recommendations. With regard to the alleged failure to comply with the provisions of the collective agreement for the period ' , the Government indicates, based on the investigations and reports of the Department of Labour and the Department of Labour Inspection and Supervision, that there is no record of any complaint regarding failure to comply with the provisions of the collective agreement for the period '  to which the complainant organizations refer. The Government also reports that a new collective agreement on working conditions has been approved. With regard to the alleged refusal to establish a joint conciliation committee, the Government provides detailed reports of the bi-national body, in which it is emphasized that there is no failure to comply with the Protocol on Labour and Social Security Relations and that an internal complaints committee comprising representatives of the enterprise and the trade unions has been established within the bi-national body pursuant to a collective agreement signed by the complainants and the entity and is fully functional. The committee has been in existence since  and, with regard to its work, the Government attaches many recent records that are evidence of its operation.
.The Committee takes due note of the detailed information provided by the Government and, having received no additional information from any of the complainant organizations since its last examination in , will not pursue its examination of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see st Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.On  May , CUT, supported by ten Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo sector trade unions, presented additional information and new allegations.
.The Government transmitted its observations in communications sent during the month of March, and on  May and  October .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendation on the pending issues [see st Report, para. ]:The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on all the allegations made in this case without delay and in particular on those reporting that the enterprise Itaip Binacional-Lado Paraguayo: () failed to comply with the CCCT for the period '  which, according to the complainants, had been the subject of several complaints submitted to the enterprise and before the administrative authority; () in a clear demonstration of anti-union practice, signed the CCCT for the period '  with several minority trade unions, sidelining the complainant organizations, which together represent  per cent of the workers, and () failed to comply with an agreement that it had signed with the complainant organizations with a view to ending the strike and took reprisals (according to the allegations, it terminated its contracts with transport companies that employed SICONAP/S members and made the recruitment of workers in the new transport companies contingent on them giving up their SICONAP/S membership; it also intends to introduce changes to an employment sector (tourism coordination), which would have the immediate effect of making STEIBI members redundant; and has established a new trade union which has been registered by the administrative authority).
.In its communication of  May , CUT, endorsed by six Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo sector trade unions, alleges that the enterprise has yet to comply fully with the provisions of the most recent collective agreement on working conditions (' ) signed with three of its trade unions, STEIBI, SICONAP/S and SITRAIBI, despite their repeated demands. In particular, it has failed to comply with articles , ,  and ; article , paragraphs  and ; articles , , , , , , , ,  and ; article , paragraph ; article (A); articles ,  and  to ; and article , paragraphs , , ,  to ,  and ; these complaints are mentioned in the records of eight bipartite meetings held in  and . A wide variety of issues are in question, including, among other things, freedom of association, housing policy, filling of vacant positions, abolition of posts, equal wages, banking hours, and the like. CUT adds that, although the management of Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo is aware of the present complaint, it has taken no decisions with a view to rectifying its conduct.
.CUT also maintains that Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo has systematically opposed the establishment of the bi-national joint conciliation committee even though article  of the Protocol on Labour and Social Security Relations to the Treaty of Itaip, which Brazil and Paraguay have signed, provides for its establishment. In support of the complaint, the representatives of four trade unions of the Brazilian branch of the enterprise also signed the CUT complaint.
.The Government attached to its communications, sent in March, as well as  May and  October , various Ministry of Labour decisions on the issues raised in the complaint, as well as communications from Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo noting that collective agreements on working conditions are concluded annually and that every trade union recognized by the competent authority is entitled to participate in negotiations and to conclude the respective collective agreements. Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo indicates that it holds meetings with the trade unions and denies the unions' claims that it failed to comply with the provisions of collective agreements, provides an explanation and sets out its position as reflected in the records of the meetings held with the trade unions; demands proof of each case in which it allegedly failed to comply with provisions of the collective agreement; in the event of a dispute, the labour administration authority attempts to bring the parties to an agreement. The current legislation permits, and even requires, the negotiation of collective agreements with recognized trade unions, including minority unions; there are, in fact, various collective agreements. According to the enterprise, instances of non-compliance with such agreements are not only monitored by the authorities but referred to a committee comprising representatives of Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo and the trade unions, which meets on a monthly basis to monitor the implementation of the collective agreement; instances of non-compliance with a provision of the agreement are examined, negotiated and even  priced' by the parties, who establish a monetary amount known as the  conciliation of interests' at the end of each annual bargaining session; this amount was approved by the complainant unions when the collective agreement was concluded on  May  and, in the case of article , it was agreed that Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo would pay its employees the equivalent of . times their wage for April  as a conciliation of interests.
.The enterprise indicates that any legal disputes which could arise with workers are reported, verified and resolved by the competent judicial authority, whose judgments are binding on the enterprise.
.The Government notes that the complainant organizations also signed collective agreements for the periods '  and ' .
.The enterprise maintains that the collective negotiations with minority trade unions in  were conducted in accordance with the law. The complainant union, STEIBI, requested the Ministry of Labour not to approve an addendum to the collective agreement signed with four trade unions. Following the negotiation of the collective agreement for the period '  with trade unions other than the complainants, the complainant unions declared a -day strike, during which the enterprise received reports of acts of violence against non-striking workers. Because such violence is illegal, the enterprise requested the judicial authority to confirm the illegality of the acts in question.
.The enterprise adds that the strike was lifted after the parties signed a new collective agreement for the period ' . The enterprise agreed not to file any administrative or legal actions against the workers involved in the strike and the trade unions agreed not to file any legal and/or administrative actions for non-compliance with the collective agreement for the period ' ; however, the trade unions, nevertheless, presented a complaint to the Committee. The measures mentioned by the complainants, such as the unilateral",0,2011,Paraguay
36,"termination of contracts for the provision of services by contractors, are envisaged at the contractual level and should not necessarily be considered as violating the compromise agreement that ended the strike. Furthermore, the complainant trade unions could have sought legal remedies. The enterprise denies that it violated the right to freedom of association and Conventions Nos  and , as alleged by the complainant trade unions.
.As for the substance of the complaint, the enterprise explains that in , the complainant trade unions, STEIBI and STICCAP, successfully concluded the first collective agreement between the representatives of Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo and its unions. The agreement established a new benefit for workers, the so-called  housing policy'  which simply meant having a home that belonged to the enterprise. Thus, the collective agreement enshrines a benefit that had already been granted by Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo since . From that time, , and each successive year thereafter until , Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo and the trade unions included this  housing policy' benefit in their agreements.
.The enterprise states that in , in light of the social and community developments, Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo adopted the position to sell its homes because continuing to own them was no longer appropriate; moreover, the employees in receipt of that benefit were constantly expressing their intention to directly purchase the homes in which they had been living for decades, thus becoming homeowners. In , Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo concluded a new collective agreement on working conditions with the trade unions, STEIBI, STICCAP, SICHAP, SICAE and SISE, which would govern labour relations between the enterprise and its employees for the period  May  to  April . The various labour benefits that the enterprise granted to its workers included a housing policy whereby it would provide its workers with housing that they would own. In that connection, Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo decided to invite the unions, of which its workers were members, to discuss and negotiate the transfer of homes to the employees who were living in them. Thus, it was agreed with various trade unions that the homes would be sold to the employees who were living in them at below the national market price and that, as compensation (for loss of the housing benefit), they would receive  per cent of the value of the home (Addendum No.  to the collective agreement for the period ' ).
.The enterprise indicates that it is reasonable to state that this new act on the part of the employer would benefit the workers. This view was shared by all the trade unions and confirmed by their assemblies, with one exception: at the last minute, while its representatives were negotiating the addendum, STEIBI objected to the sale of the homes to the workers. Two other trade unions, SICONAP/S and SITRAIBI, gave in and adopted the position taken by STEIBI.
.According to the enterprise, negotiation of the housing policy led to disagreement between the trade unions; their workers were divided into two camps with STEIBI, SICONAP/S and SITRAIBI (a newly established union at that time), which opposed the sale of the homes on one side, and STICCAP, SICAE, SICHAP and SISE, which agreed to the conditions of sale, on the other. This lack of agreement between the unions led to false allegations of persecution and discrimination. Paraguay s judiciary has confirmed that there had been no persecution.
.According to the enterprise, since December , the complainant trade unions have been making a systematic effort to prevent the workers from exercising their right to acquire decent housing. They opposed the Ministry s approval of Addendum No.  to the collective agreement for the period ' , appealed against the administrative decision once it had been taken and presented the present complaint, to the detriment of truth and reality.
.The enterprise states that the Government of Paraguay has empowered all its bodies (executive, judicial and legislative) to receive complaints from trade unions. All of these complaints have been considered analytically and objectively and, in every case, it has been decided that the sale of the homes represented social progress for the affected zone and for State policy since, through this mechanism, some , people would become homeowners under optimal conditions. In every case, the aforementioned bodies have concluded that the arguments adduced by the complainant trade unions were totally unfounded, illogical, unreasonable and contrary to the interests of society and, in particular, of the workers. To date, over  homes have been sold and  Paraguayan families have benefited as a result of Addendum No.  to the collective agreement for the period '  and its administrative approval (over the objections of the complainant trade unions).
.Lastly, the enterprise maintains that the fact that  per cent of its workers are union members and that various collective agreements have been concluded constitutes proof of freedom of association and non-discrimination.
.The Committee observes that, in their early communications, the complainant organizations allege that Itaip Binacional-Lado Paraguayo: () failed to comply with the collective agreement on working conditions for the period ' , which, according to those organizations, was the subject of various complaints presented to the enterprise and to the administrative authority, particularly with regard to an addendum to the collective agreement concluded with minority trade unions; () in an open demonstration of anti union practice, signed the collective agreement for the period '  with several minority trade unions, sidelining the complainant organizations, which, together, represent  per cent of the workers; and () failed to observe an agreement, signed with the complainant organizations that had ended a strike and took reprisals (according to the allegations, the enterprise terminated its contracts with transport companies whose workers were members of SICONAP/S and made the hiring of workers by the new transport companies contingent on them giving up their SICONAP/S membership); it also intends to introduce changes in an employment sector (tourism coordination) that would have the immediate effect of making STEIBI members redundant.
.With regard to the allegations that the enterprise failed to comply with the collective agreement with the complainant trade unions for the period ' ; signed a collective agreement for the period '  with minority unions and following a strike by the complainant trade unions failed to comply with the agreement not to take reprisals (it is alleged that contracts with transport subcontractors were terminated); and, made the recruitment of workers in new transport companies contingent on them giving up their SICONAP/S membership, the Committee takes note of the enterprise s statement that: () it did not violate the right to freedom of association or Conventions Nos  and , that  per cent of its workers are union members and that collective agreements had been concluded with the existing trade unions; () the main problem has been that the complainant trade unions (unlike other unions) have persistently opposed a collective agreement allowing the sale of homes to the people who had been allowed to live in them; this objective of the enterprise was initially endorsed by all the trade unions (including SICONAP/S and SITRAIBI) with the exception of STEIBI, which, at the last minute, opposed the sale (which would benefit some , workers); SICONAP/S and SITRAIBI then joined STEIBI in opposing the initiative; the other unions ultimately signed an addendum to the collective agreement for the period ' ; the complainant trade unions nevertheless opposed ' unsuccessfully, as is clear from the appeals presented to various authorities ' approval of the aforementioned addendum by the Ministry of Labour; () this situation led to a strike by the complainant trade unions with illegal acts of violence against non-striking workers; the strike was ended through an agreement between the parties with a reciprocal commitment not to take reprisals (including not filing any legal and/or administrative actions); however, a complaint on this matter was presented to the Committee; () the unilateral termination of contracts for the provision of services by contractors, mentioned by the complainant trade unions, is a measure envisaged at the contractual level and should not necessarily be viewed as violating the commitment not to take reprisals that was signed at the end of the strike; furthermore, the complainant trade unions had the right to seek legal remedies; and () after the strike had ended, a collective agreement with the complainant trade unions for the period '  was signed.
.The Committee would like to point out that the complainant trade unions are (as stated in the complaint and not contested by the enterprise) the majority unions. In that connection, without undertaking to evaluate the merits of its objective or to consider whether it benefits the workers, the addendum to the collective agreement for the period '  that the enterprise concluded with the minority unions so that workers could purchase the homes in which they were already living may raise questions in relation to the principles of freedom of association in so far as, in principle, any",0,2011,Paraguay
37,"provision that altered the content of the collective agreement in question should have been adopted with the consent of all the signatory trade unions.
.The Committee regrets that, although the complaint was presented in , the Government did not send its reply until . Nevertheless, the Committee considers that since, according to the enterprise, over  workers have purchased their homes since the strike was lifted in  with the signing of an agreement, and since the collective agreement with the complainant trade unions for the period '  has been signed, the issue has been overtaken by events in so far as it would be difficult to reverse the situation with regard to ownership of the homes and the complainant trade unions have signed a new collective agreement for the period ' . The Committee also notes that the enterprise challenges the present complaint by the complainant trade unions on the grounds that the agreement that ended the strike in  included a provision stipulating that no complaints would be presented.
.The Committee observes that, in its most recent communications, CUT alleges: () that Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo has failed to comply with numerous provisions of the collective agreement for the period ' , to the detriment of the signatory trade unions (STEIBI, SICONAP/S and SITRAIBI); and () that, despite an agreement signed by Brazil and Paraguay, the enterprise has opposed the establishment of the bi-national joint conciliation committee.
.The Committee takes note of the following statements by Itaip Binacional ' Lado Paraguayo transmitted by the Government: () workers bring legal disputes regarding the application of provisions before the judicial authority, whose judgments are binding on the employer; () cases of non-compliance with collective agreements are examined by a committee comprising representatives of the enterprise and the trade unions, which meets on a monthly basis; cases of failure to comply with a provision of such an agreement are examined, negotiated and even  priced' by the parties, who set an amount established annually at the end of the collective bargaining; () non-compliance with a provision of a collective agreement must, however, be proved; () the enterprise provided an explanation and set out its position in the hope that the trade unions' complaints regarding non compliance with such provisions would be rejected; and () in the event of a dispute, the labour administration authority attempts to bring the parties to an agreement. The Committee takes note of the enterprise s statement that current legislation permits, and even requires, the negotiation of collective agreements with trade unions, including minority unions, and that there are, in fact, various collective agreements.
.The Committee observes that the collective agreements currently in force at Itaip Binacional-Lado Paraguayo, including the collective agreement with the trade unions represented by the complainant organization for the period ' , call for the establishment of a bipartite committee to consider the cases of non-compliance mentioned by the trade unions. The Committee further observes that, according to the enterprise, instances of non-compliance may, in some cases, be  priced' with an amount of compensation set during the annual collective bargaining session; in other cases, the parties' positions regarding compliance with provisions affecting the workers, including members of the three trade unions represented by the claimant organizations, are radically divergent. The Committee observes that the complainant organization refers in its complaint to numerous provisions that, in its view, have not been implemented (concerning, among other things, freedom of association, the abolition of posts and the filling of vacant positions). Because the parties' opinions on those matters are sharply divided (for example, on the question of the bipartite committee envisaged in the collective agreement), it invites the Government to institute an investigation through the labour inspectorate and to keep it informed of the outcome without delay.
.With respect to the alleged opposition of the enterprise to the establishment of the bi national joint conciliation committee even though an agreement signed by Brazil and Paraguay provides for its establishment, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to this allegation and requests to be kept informed in that regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee invites the Government to institute an investigation, through the labour inspectorate, into the alleged failure to comply with the provisions of the collective agreement for the period '  to which the complainant organizations refer and to keep it informed of the outcome without delay.(b) With regard to the allegation that the enterprise has opposed the establishment of the bi-national joint conciliation committee even though an agreement signed by Brazil and Paraguay provides for its establishment, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to this allegation and requests to be kept informed in that regard.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the Union of Workers of the enterprise Itaip Binacional-Lado Paraguayo (STEIBI), the Union of Drivers and Services of the Alto Paran (SICONAP/S), the Union of Workers of Itaip Binacional (SITRAIBI) and the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT) dated  September and  October .
.At its meetings in March, June and October , the Committee made urgent appeals to the Government and drew its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it would present a report on the substance of the case, even if it had not received the information or observations from the Government in due time. To date, no information has been received from the Government.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  September and  October , the complainants state that STEIBI and SITRAIBI are first-level trade unions for the workers of the enterprise Itaip Binacional-Lado Paraguayo (hereafter, the enterprise). SICONAP/S is a first-level trade union for all transport and services workers in the Alto Paran department, including the workers in the enterprise and in its subcontractors. The enterprise is an institution established under article III of the treaty signed between the Republic of Paraguay and the Federative Republic of Brazil on  April  and ratified by Paraguay under Act No.  of  July .
.The complainants indicate that the enterprise signed a collective agreement on working conditions (CCCT) with the complainant organizations and that between June and September  they submitted several complaints of non-compliance to the enterprise. They add that in December , STEIBI requested the Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Security to reject the enterprise s application for approval of an addendum to the agreement signed with four minority trade unions (according to the complainants, STEIBI represents  per cent of the workers). However, the administrative authority denied the request and approved the addendum by Decision No.  of  December .
.The complainants report that the negotiations of the CCCT for the period '  were held between  March and  April . In this context, a complaint was submitted to the authorities indicating that the enterprise was circulating malicious allegations that the trade unions had brought excessive demands to the negotiations, and that it was dividing the trade unions.
.The complainants report that on  April , in an open demonstration of anti-union practice, the enterprise signed the CCCT for the period '  with several minority trade unions, sidelining the complainant organizations, which together represent  per cent of the workers. The complainants add that on  April  they informed the enterprise management that their respective assemblies had rejected its counter-proposals and had decided to hold a -day strike, starting on  May . The complainants report that, in an act of intimidation against the right to strike, the enterprise filed a complaint on  May alleging that the complainants on strike were blocking the enterprise s entrances and applied for an injunction. This was rejected after the court registrar declared that the complaint was inadmissible.
.The complainants indicate that on  May  documents were signed establishing the end of the CCCT negotiation with the enterprise, a supplementary agreement, and the end of strike with compromise agreement. In the last document, the enterprise agreed not to file any administrative or legal actions against the workers involved in the strike, regardless of whether they were members of the trade unions that declared the strike. The trade unions agreed not to file any legal and/or administrative actions for non-compliance with the CCCT for '  (according to the complainants, this demonstrates that the enterprise admits to non-compliance with the CCCT).
.The complainants report that, without observing the compromise agreement ending the strike, by way of reprisal against the trade unions, the enterprise: () terminated its relationship with the transport subcontracting companies (SICONAP/S had members working in those companies) without providing a reason and made the recruitment of workers in",0,2011,Paraguay
38,"new transport companies contingent on them giving up their SICONAP/S membership, and () intends to introduce changes to an employment sector (tourism coordination), which would have the immediate effect of making STEIBI members redundant. Lastly, the complainants also report that the enterprise has established a new trade union which has been registered by the administrative authority.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time elapsed since the presentation of the complaint, the Government has not provided the information requested, despite being invited to do so by means of three urgent appeals (the last of these at its meeting in October ).
.Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body], the Committee finds itself obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without the benefit of the information that it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom in law and in fact. The Committee remains confident that, if the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning the allegations made against them.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainants allege that the enterprise: () failed to comply with the CCCT for the period '  which, according to the complainants, had been the subject of several complaints submitted to the enterprise and before the administrative authority; () in a clear demonstration of anti-union practice, signed the CCCT for the period '  with several minority trade unions, sidelining the complainant organizations, which together represent  per cent of the workers; and () did not comply with an agreement that it had signed with the complainant organizations with a view to ending the strike and took reprisals (according to the allegations, it terminated its contracts with transport companies that employed SICONAP/S members and made the recruitment of workers in the new transport companies contingent on them giving up their SICONAP/S membership; it intends to introduce changes to an employment sector (tourism coordination), which would have the immediate effect of making STEIBI members redundant; and has established a new trade union which has been registered by the administrative authority).
.In this regard, the Committee recalls  the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relations' and that  agreements should be binding on the parties' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee also wishes to recall that, on numerous occasions, it has stressed that  respect for the principles of freedom of association requires that workers should not be dismissed or refused re-employment on account of their having participated in a strike or other industrial action. It is irrelevant for these purposes whether the dismissal occurs during or after the strike' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to send its observations on all the allegations made in this case without delay.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on all the allegations made in this case without delay and in particular on those reporting that the enterprise Itaip Binacional-Lado Paraguayo: () failed to comply with the CCCT for the period '  which, according to the complainants, had been the subject of several complaints submitted to the enterprise and before the administrative authority; () in a clear demonstration of anti-union practice, signed the CCCT for the period '  with several minority trade unions, sidelining the complainant organizations, which together represent  per cent of the workers, and () failed to comply with an agreement that it had signed with the complainant organizations with a view to ending the strike and took reprisals (according to the allegations, it terminated its contracts with transport companies that employed SICONAP/S members and made the recruitment of workers in the new transport companies contingent on them giving up their SICONAP/S membership; it also intends to introduce changes to an employment sector (tourism coordination), which would have the immediate effect of making STEIBI members redundant; and has established a new trade union which has been registered by the administrative authority).",-1,2011,Paraguay
39,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Trade Union of Transport Workers (SINATT) dated  November . SINATT sent new allegations in a communication dated  May .
.The Government sent it observations in a communication of  May .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , SINATT states that it is a first-level representative association for all transport workers providing services in the collective passenger transport industry. It adds that, on  September , union members Roberto Medina Gimnez and Gustavo Klaner called on all those concerned to set up a workers' committee to represent the workers of the transport company La Santaniana SA. The invitation to the initial meeting set a date of  September  at  a.m. at house No.  in Lepacho c/Inca in the city of Asuncin, the purpose being accreditation of the workers authorized to establish a trade union.
.The complaint organization states that on  September  at  a.m.,  workers met in order to hold discussions and as appropriate to set up a committee. Once the officers of the meeting had been elected and the agenda drawn up, it was agreed to form a workers' committee at the transport enterprise, and in accordance with SINATT by-laws the regular and deputy delegates Juan Carlos Martini Nez and Sergio Coronel, respectively, were elected, as well as other officers. On  September , the President of SINATT together with the regular member of the workers' committee submitted an application for registration with the Vice-Ministry of Labour and Social Security, together with the documentation required under section  of the Labour Code. On  September , SINATT sent registered telegram No.  to the company informing it of the establishment of the workers' committee, the elected delegates who would enjoy the right to union stability, and the duration of their term of office.
.The union states that in Resolution No.  of  September  adopted by the ViceMinistry of Labour and Social Security, the documents submitted were duly legalized and the delegates of the workers' committee were registered. The complainant adds that with notes (incoming reference Nos / and /) submitted to the Ministry of Justice and Labour, the enterprise brought an action for hierarchical remedy and appeal against Resolution No.  of  September  adopted by the Vice-Ministry of Labour and Social Security, contesting the legalization of the documents and the registration of the workers' committee delegates on the following grounds: (a) there is no provision for the establishment of workers' committees in the Labour Code, or in the bylaws of SINATT; (b) SINATT had not complied with section (a) of the Labour Code which requires that ' a) the labour administrative authority be informed within ten working days following each election of any changes in the executive committee and of any amendments to the act of constitution and by-laws, for which purpose they shall provide authentic copies of the relevant documents, duly obtaining legal certification and registration of the latter for them to be valid'  and ' b) each year a list be provided to the administrative authority of the names of all persons who have joined or left [the committee]' 
.SINATT alleges that Ministry of Justice and Labour Resolution No.  of  October  revoked Resolution No.  of  September  of the Vice-Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and consequently cancelled the legalization of the documents and the registration of the workers' committee delegates at the enterprise. In a written communication (incoming document reference No.  dated  October ) SINATT applied for the remedy of revocation and appeal against Ministry of Justice and Labour Resolution No.  of  October . As of the date on which this complaint was made, no final ruling has been given despite the attempts to expedite matters.
.SINATT states that the arguments invoked by the Ministry of Justice and Labour to annul the legal personality of the workers' committee at the company have no legal basis or logic. Since its foundation in August  and in accordance with its by-laws, SINATT has established more than  workers' committees, all of which are registered with the Vice-Ministry of Labour and Social Security. SINATT states that the transport enterprise La Santaniana SA is part of a holding company comprising  companies that belong to one employers' group, in the majority of which there is no union precisely because of the group s anti-union practices. SINATT maintains that, although the workers' rights are inalienable, the founder members of the workers' committee have been coerced into signing a document, the seventh clause of which states that they abide by Ministry of Justice and Labour Resolution No.  and expressly refrain from contesting its provisions. According to SINATT, the Ministry of Justice and Labour has acted arbitrarily and illegally by annulling the legal personality of the workers' committee at La Santaniana SA, which under international standards and national law it is not authorized to do.
.In its communication of  May , SINATT states that together with other transport workers' federations it has presented a number of representations to the Government in connection with workers' demands, and specifically regarding the lack of freedom of association in the sector. It alleges that the Government, through the Ministry of Justice and Labour, undertook to set up a technical committee for the purpose of settling disputes, including the case of the workers' committee at La Santaniana SA. According to SINATT, however, the technical committee was never set up and there has been no response to the representations.
.SINATT adds that it and other transport sector organizations in Paraguay held a two-day workshop in January , during which they discussed and adopted a number of conclusions: point  of which states that the Ministry of Justice and Labour does not respect freedom of association.
.The complainant states that the Ministry of Justice and Labour issued Resolution No.  on  March , rejecting the application for reconsideration of Resolution No.  of  October  by which the Ministry had annulled the legal personality of the workers' committee at the enterprise. During this period (almost five months), the employers managed to break up the workers' committee through antiunion measures and without any reaction from the Ministry of Justice and Labour. The rejection of SINATT s application for reconsideration was based on the argument that the principle of legality prevents the Ministry from examining such an appeal. When the employers lodged a similar appeal, however, the Ministry not only allowed it to proceed, but actually ruled in favour of the employers, something that is specifically prohibited by Paraguayan labour law and ILO Convention No. .
.The complainant organization states that another important aspect of this case is the fact that article  of the same Resolution No.  states that the SINATT appeal is admissible and requires the Ministry of Justice and Labour to provide all the relevant background documents to the Labour Appeals Court in order to enable the union to substantiate its claim. As of  May , however, that material had not been provided for the Labour Court, so that SINATT cannot seek the annulment of the Ministry s arbitrary Resolution No.  of  October .
.Lastly, SINATT states that the Ministry of Justice and Labour, in a formal note, MJT/SG/ dated  May , orders SINATT within  hours to communicate its institutional and official position regarding the complaint presented to the ILO. SINATT claims that this constitutes a form of coercion or intimidation, there being no justification for such notice.
.In its communication of  May , the Government categorically denies that SINATT has any legal right to present a complaint to the ILO s Committee on Freedom of Association, inasmuch as on  March  the appeal against Ministerial Resolution No.  of  October  was referred to the Labour Appeals Court of the capital, of which the union s President was also informed.
.The Government adds that the judicial authority has not yet given a definitive ruling on the matter. That means that the normal channels of redress available in Paraguay remain open, but SINATT s lack of legitimacy lies in the fact that the organizers of the assembly which created the works council are not members of the union.
.The Government states that the background information in this case shows that in a note, MJT/SGT/N dated  September , SINATT sought from the administrative labour authority recognition of the workers' committee delegates at the transport company. Considering that the union organization in question with legal personality is seeking recognition of the delegates elected at the constituent General Assembly of  September  in accordance with its by-laws, the Legal Advisory Service issued ruling No.  of  September , by which the workers' committee of the transport enterprise La",0,2010,Paraguay
40,"Santaniana SA, was granted recognition and registered in accordance with Resolution No. /.
.According to case files referred to the Ministry of Justice and Labour (incoming document reference Nos / and /) and to the General Directorate of Legal Advisory Services (incoming document reference Nos / and /), the representatives of La Santaniana SA are lodging an action for hierarchical remedy and appeal against Resolution No.  of the ViceMinistry of Labour and Social Security of  September , which grants recognition and registration to the members of the workers' committee of the transport enterprise concerned who are affiliated to SINATT. The argument put forward for this is that there is no provision in the Labour Code or in the by-laws of SINATT for such a works council, and none of the members of the works council belonged to the union. As regards the question whether the works council members at the company are SINATT members, the legal advisors of the General Directorate of Legal Advisory Services met with the Department of Collective Relations and Trade Union Registration, of the Subsecretariat of State for Labour and Social Security, subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and Labour, in order to determine whether the relevant workers are members of SINATT. The background documents of the union available to the Subsecretariat indicate that those listed as members of the workers' committee at La Santaniana SA are not listed as SINATT members, and thus the requirements of section  of the Labour Code are not met; according to the provision in question, the union is required under subparagraph (b) each year to give the names of all persons who have joined or left [the committee].  Article  of the SINATT by-laws stipulates that, in order to be elected as a delegate, a member must be at least  years of age, hold Paraguayan nationality (either from birth or by naturalization), have at least one year s length of service in his or her job, and must have been a member of the union for the same period. In the case of new enterprises the length of service requirements may be dropped.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Government cites verbatim other provisions of the SINATT by-laws:Membership, rights and obligations of membersArticle . All workers employed in this area of activity, irrespective of their political ideology, religious beliefs, race or nationality, shall be entitled to join SINATT. For a worker to be admitted as a member, he or she shall be required to have expressed a wish to join in writing and that application must be accepted by the national executive committee. The latter is required to give its decision within  working days and may not refuse the application without stating a valid reason. Should that period elapse without a decision being given, the application shall be deemed to have been tacitly accepted.A refusal shall always be subject to confirmation by the general congress of delegates, to which body the national executive committee shall be required to report its decision at the meeting closest in time to the date on which the decision is given.An application for membership shall be considered to imply that the applicant is familiar with the relevant regulations and undertakes to abide by them.Article . Unsuccessful applicants for membership shall be entitled to contest the refusal before the national congress of delegates which meets on the date closest to the date on which he or she is notified of that decision. The appeal must be made within  days of receipt of the notification that application for membership has been refused, and must be substantiated.Article . The worker s application for membership may be refused under the circumstances specified in the relevant laws and regulations if they are reliably established.Rights and obligationsArticle . Members who have been members for at least one month and have paid their dues shall be entitled to:
.Request and receive any due assistance in accordance with its purposes, and also receive other benefits under the by-laws, provided that the requirements of the respective regulations are met.
.Submit to the national executive committee any project which he or she may consider to be of potential collective benefit for workers in this area of activities.
.Put forward proposals for consideration by the assemblies.
.Promote any measure to ensure compliance with the relevant laws and regulations.Article . Members who have been members for at least six months in the area of activity shall be entitled to speak and vote in assemblies and to vote in elections.
.The Government adds that none of the participants in the assembly which elected the workers' committee delegates were SINATT members and were thus not subjected, either actively or passively, to the established procedures of the meeting and elections under the (new) SINATT by-laws. Interestingly, SINATT s by-laws contain no legal basis for its auxiliary body (the works council) and was put on notice to establish one. The crucial element is the presentation of the list of new members at La Santaniana SA, which was received in the registry of Ministry of Justice and Labour (Vice-Ministry for Labour and Social Security), incoming document reference No.  dated  October .
.The Government states that the legal advisory service has also noted that with NDT No.  of  September , the Director-General of Labour instructed SINATT to adjust its by-laws within  days to provide for the establishment of the works council, on pain of deregistration. The Government states that SINATT has complied with NDT No.  of  September , partially amending the SINATT by-laws (incoming document reference No. / at the Vice-Ministry of Labour and Social Security and incoming document reference No. / at the General Directorate of the Legal Advisory Service). Subsequently the Legal Advisory Service issued its ruling No.  of  October  to the effect that Resolution No. / was annulled by Ministry of Justice and Labour Resolution No. /. This was prompted by section (b) of the Labour Code, the body of laws in force, and SINATT s own by-laws, the Ministry of Justice and Labour being the highest authority of the labour administration and as such responsible for reviewing and overseeing the administrative acts of its subordinates.
.The Government adds that subsequently, according to a note received by the Ministry of Justice and Labour under (reference /), SINATT representatives affiliated to the CUT lodged an application for reconsideration and appeal of the Ministry s Resolution No.  of  October . The Ministry s Legal Advisory Service again passed Resolution, No.  of  March , rejecting the application for reconsideration and upholding the appeal. The application was referred to the Labour Appeals Court in the city of Asuncin, as required by law, on  March  with a view to substantiating the application.
.The Government states that the resolutions originating from the Vice-Ministry of Labour and Social Security under the Ministry of Justice and Labour in the years ,  and , which are provided as proof of recognition and registration of workers' committees at the company (according to SINATT), assumes that delegates and those attending electoral meetings are members of SINATT; they are undoubtedly flawed in the sense that the union s by-laws do not provide an explicit legal basis for this. The Ministry of Justice and Labour has adhered to all the established administrative process, and the terms of the relevant resolutions can be presumed to be legal under Paraguayan law; it is the Ministry s intention to defend freedom of association at all levels, and in this case in particular will have to submit to a judicial ruling. Lastly, the Government emphatically denies that the invitation to establish a workers' committee at SINATT is legal, especially in the company, because the workers in question were not members of the union. Paraguay has ratified ILO Conventions Nos  and  but cannot depart from legality in order to register a workers' committee whose members are not members of the very union from which the committee is purportedly derived.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, SINATT alleges that, following initial registration of a workers' committee and its delegates at La Santaniana SA with the administrative authority, the company contested the registration and the Ministry of Justice and Labour, invoking arguments that lacked any legal basis or logic, revoked its previous decision (SINATT states that it has since  set up more than  workers' committees which were registered with the ViceMinistry of Labour and Social Security).
.In this connection the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () on  September , SINATT applied to the administrative labour authority for recognition and registration of a workers' committee at the company referred to; () the Legal Advisory Service of the administrative authority approved the application, and the workers' committee was duly granted recognition and registered under Resolution No. / of the Vice-Ministry of Labour and Social Security; () the company s representatives lodged an action for hierarchical remedy and appeal against Resolution No.",-1,2010,Paraguay
41,"/, arguing that there was no provision in the Labour Code or in SINATT s by-laws for the establishment of a works council, and that none of the works council members was a member of SINATT; () the attorneys of the General Directorate of the Legal Advisory Service met with the Department of Collective Relations and Trade Union Registration, subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and Labour, in order to ascertain whether the company s workers are members of SINATT; the background documents of the union in question indicated that the persons named in the list of members of the workers' committee are not SINATT members, and the requirements of section  of the Labour Code are therefore not met; () the SINATT by-laws contained no legal basis for the establishment of any auxiliary body like the works council, and SINATT was put on notice to establish one; the Director-General of Labour instructed SINATT to amend its statutes within  days to provide for the establishment of a works council on pain of deregistration; () on  October , Resolution No. / was annulled by Resolution No. / of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, in accordance with sections (b) and (d) of the Labour Code and SINATT s own by-laws; () subsequently SINATT lodged an application for reconsideration and appeal of Resolution No.  of  October , and the application for reconsideration was rejected by the Legal Advisory Service of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, but the appeal was upheld; () the appeal was referred to the Labour Appeals Court of Asuncin on  March ; and () the Government questions the legality of the SINATT workers' committee at the company because the workers in question were not members of the union.
.The Committee considers that, in the light of the information available to it and unless the complainant organization sends additional information proving the contrary, the allegations in this case would not appear to amount to violations of freedom of association. Nonetheless, taking account of the fact that SINATT lodged an appeal against Resolution No.  of  October  of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, annulling registration of the workers' committee at the company in question, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.
.The Committee wishes to highlight that the information relating to the affiliation of workers to a trade union should be confidential, except of course in cases where trade union dues are deducted on payroll.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the appeal lodged by SINATT against Resolution No.  of  October  of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, which annulled the registration of the workers' committee at La Santaniana SA.",-1,2010,Paraguay
42,".The complaint is set out in a communication from the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP) dated  January .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  June .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January , the CESITEP alleges that a group of individuals broke into the regional hospital of Encarnacin, in the Department of Itapa and physically assaulted hospital officials and medical and paramedical staff working there at the time. The violence resulted in injury to one of the women employees, nurse Marcia Rivas,  years of age, who was dragged by the hair and beaten by a fully identified heavily built individual claiming to represent the local Liberal Party, and was then left lying injured on the floor. During the assault, she also was robbed of her mobile phone and personal papers. The injured woman is a union representative of CESITEP in the health district in question and the Chairperson of the Council in the Department of Itapa. The assault therefore has connotations of anti-union persecution against the general background of the escalation of action by the Government against the Independent Trade Union Movement, which began with the brutal assault by security forces against peaceful demonstrators in front of the National Congress on  November , as a result of which many people suffered injuries, including fractures in both legs sustained by Ms Zulma Rojas, union official and Vice-President of the Union of Nurses and Health-Care Staff of the Clinical Hospital (SDEHC).
.The CESITEP adds that the assault against the workers and trade union officials is an open attack on fundamental human rights, including freedom of association and on the freedom to exercise activities that enable citizens to develop their creativity or, in this case, the freedom to provide humanitarian assistance at locations as sensitive and essential to the country as the public assistance and health centres.
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that it sent notes to the authorities mentioned in the communication presented by the CESITEP, which refer to the situations of Ms Marcia Rivas and Ms Zulma Rojas. In this regard, the Government states that, according to the report of the Collective Relations and Union Registration Section under the office of the Deputy Minister for Labour and Social Security: (a) Ms Zulma Rojas occupies the post of Vice-President of the SDEHC, registration No. , dated  August ; and (b) Ms Marcia Rivas is a regular member of the electoral tribunal of CESITEP under the terms of Resolution No.  of  May . She is also a member of the Decentralized Council of Delegates of the Workers' Union of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (SITRAMIS) for the Department of Itapa (Seventh Health District ' Encarnacin Regional Hospital), under the terms of Resolution No.  of  July .
.The reports of the National Police Command make it clear that: (a) national police report No.  notes that on  November , at the metropolitan police precinct No. , no complaint made in connection with the alleged theft of a mobile phone has been recorded. As regards allegations of police repression, the report states that the demonstrators, comprising mainly employees of the Association of Union Employees of ANDE, attempted to force their way into the National Congress via  May Street. Finding that they were unable to do so, they threw stones at police officers posted in the area, hitting one of them (junior police officer Fabio Vargas Gallardo) in the face, while another junior police officer, Fredy Abel Bentez, was cut in the right leg as a result of firecracker detonations. The demonstrators were contained by warning shots of rubber bullets fired by anti-riot police. On that occasion, several boxes of firecrackers as well as knives and blunt weapons were confiscated. Some of the demonstrators suffered minor injuries and were taken to an emergencies centre; (b) according to national police report No. , the assault against Ms Marcia Rivas was perpetrated by a mob of demonstrators, not by the police. According to the police headquarters of the Department of Itapa, Ms Marcia Rivas was assaulted in a corridor of the regional hospital at the hands of a mob of individuals led by Mr Dionisio Ibez, who repeatedly kicked her. She was kept in hospital for  hours and lodged a complaint at the police precinct No.  which is subordinate to Itapa police headquarters.
.According to the report of the Clinical Hospital, Ms Zulma Rojas sustained a unimaleolar fracture of the right fibula and a grade II sprain in the left ankle. She was treated by the emergency service at the abovementioned hospital and is still undergoing treatment there.
.In conclusion, the Government states that according to the reports received from the competent authorities, Ms Marcia Rivas did indeed sustain injuries but as a result of action by other demonstrators, not because of the police. The Government notes that a demonstration was held in front of the National Congress, on the date referred to above, and the police acted to bar the demonstrators from entering Congress for reasons connected with the need to ensure the security of the Legislature.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the alleged assault against demonstrators in front of the National Congress on  November , resulting in numerous injuries and, in particular, the fracture in both legs sustained by Ms Zulma Rojas, VicePresident of the SDEHC, the Committee urges the Government to take the measures needed to conduct without delay an investigation into these allegations with the aim of determining responsibilities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of this investigation.(b) As regards the alleged physical assault suffered by Ms Marcia Rivas, President of the Council in the Department of Itapa and union representative in the Itapa health district, at the hands of a group of individuals as they forced their way into the Regional Hospital of Encarnacin, during the course of which she suffered injuries and was robbed of a mobile phone and personal papers, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the complaint lodged by the union official Ms Marcia Rivas with the police and, in particular, whether the individual identified as the author of the assaults has been tried and punished.",0,2009,Paraguay
43,".The complaint is set out in a communication of the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP) dated  December .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  June .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  December , the CESITEP states that it is presenting the complaint on behalf of the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare. The CESITEP indicates that Ms Angelina Concepcin Ortiz de Pessutto, Ms Juana Sosa and Ms Elsa Bentez are delegates of the union at the It District Hospital (which comes under the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare). The delegates were recognized as such by the assembly and by Resolution No.  of  November  of the Ministry of Justice and Labour. That means they are union representatives of the workers at the hospital in question, which has become a difficult environment for union members because of the harassment by the new management. The CESITEP alleges that the delegates in question were removed from the workplace where they are supposed to represent the union because they had taken action to defend workers and participated in three demonstrations in support of claims in front of the National Parliament. According to the CESITEP one of these marches was brutally crushed on  November  (these allegations are the subject of Case No. ).
.The CESITEP indicates that the new management wants to break up the existing trade union representation recognized by the workers and by the authorities, because action to defend workers' interests in a highly sensitive public sector such as the health sector does not suit the new authorities, which prefer to fall back on the same strategies as those they complained of before they came to power; that is, to exclude those who do not share their views from the public administration in favour of tame officials who will allow them to act as they wish. According to the CESITEP, existing laws and regulations are being violated, for example, Law No. /, section  of which stipulates that:  the [job] security of the trade union official as provided for in the Constitution shall be guaranteed in those cases and subject to those limitations set out in this law, the labour law also being applicable'  and section  of the Labour Code according to which:  trade union stability shall mean the guarantee enjoyed by certain workers not to be dismissed, transferred, suspended or subjected to modified working conditions, without a valid reason approved in advance by a competent judge' 
.According to the CESITEP, law is absolutely clear and does not allow for interpretation. No effort of study is needed to deduce the violation of any norm relating to relations between the State and its servants through action undertaken without any consultation and aimed solely at breaking up the union organization and harming its members. What is more, Ms Elsa Bentez suffers from ailments due to her nursing activity and is prone to health problems that prevent her from working the long hours that would be required to commute to the location where she has been transferred to, which is some  km from her present home and not served by public transport.
.In its communication of  June , the Government indicates that it has sent notes to the authorities mentioned in the note presented by the CESITEP. In this regard, the Government states that the report of the Collective Relations and Union Registration Section under the office of the Deputy Minister for Labour and Social Security indicates that: () Ms Angelina Concepcin Ortiz de Pessutto, Ms Juana Sosa and Ms Elsa Bentez are not representatives of the Union of Employees of the It District Hospital (SIFUHDI), which was recognized by Resolution No.  of  May ; () the persons mentioned are delegates of the Decentralized Council of the Workers' Union of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (SITRAMIS) for the It District Hospital, under Resolution No.  of  July; and () Resolution No.  of  November , mentioned in the note, is not in the registry of the Collective Relations and Union Registration Section (the Government also transmits information on the allegations regarding acts of violence that are being examined under Case No. ).
.The Committee notes that in this case, the complainant organization alleges that in the context of anti-union harassment, Ms Angelina Concepcin Ortiz de Pessutto, Ms Juana Sosa and Ms Elsa Bentez, delegates of the Union of Workers of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare at the It District Hospital, were transferred to a distant location not served by public transport, thus removing them from the workplace where they act as union representatives, for having taken part in three marches in front of the National Parliament in support of workers' claims.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that the delegates in question are not representatives of the Union of Employees of the It District Hospital, but delegates of the Decentralized Council of the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare for the It District Hospital, and that Resolution No.  of  November , mentioned in the allegations (and which according to the allegations recognizes their status as union representatives of another union) is not in the records of the Collective Relations and Union Registration Section of the Ministry of Labour.
.The Committee notes with regret that the Government has not communicated its observations on the allegations concerning the anti-union transfer of the union delegates in question. The Committee recalls that, when examining allegations on various forms of discrimination, it has highlighted on numerous occasions that  protection against acts of anti-union discrimination should cover not only hiring and dismissal, but also any discriminatory measures during employment, in particular transfers, downgrading and other acts that are prejudicial to the worker' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ].
.Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation without delay into alleged anti-union transfers of trade union delegates Ms Angelina Concepcin Ortiz de Pessutto, Ms Juana Sosa and Ms Elsa Bentez, of the It District Hospital, and if the transfers are found to have been motivated by the trade union status of the employees in question, or by their exercise of legitimate trade union activities (for example, the exercise of the right to demonstrate, as the complainant organization alleges), to take the necessary measures to ensure that they are reinstated in the posts they occupied before their transfers. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation without delay into alleged anti-union transfers of the union delegates Ms Angelina Concepcin Ortiz de Pessutto, Ms Juana Sosa and Ms Elsa Bentez of the It District Hospital, and, if the transfers are found to have been motivated by the trade union status of the individuals in question, or by their exercise of legitimate union activities (such as the exercise of the right to demonstrate, as the complainant organization alleges), to take the necessary measures to ensure that they are reinstated in the posts they occupied before their transfers.

.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, in May , the Committee made the following recommendations [see nd Report, para. ]:
.The complainant organization had attached to its complaint a copy of the complaint lodged with the national police by the trade union member. According to the complaint she was pushed and punched.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that the complaint of physical assault lodged against a former manager of the company Caas Paraguayas, SA (CAPASA) by Ms Juana Erenia Penayo de Sanabria is filed under police case file No. / of  May . The Government states that the Public Prosecutor s Office has no record of a complaint involving Ms Juana Erenia Penayo de Sanabria and/or the former manager, and specifies that by way of note No. / of  March  the national police headquarters indicated that the complaint of physical assault did not give rise to a police investigation, as it was an offence punishable exclusively through private prosecution, in accordance with article () of the Criminal Code:  the criminal prosecution of the matter shall depend on a request by the victim  ? Furthermore, the Government has sent a copy of a note from the executive management of the company, indicating that Ms Juana Erenia Penayo de Sanabria is on the employee payroll and is working as a machine operator in the packaging section of the company.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations that were still pending in this case related to the physical assault against a woman worker, member of the trade union, Ms Juana Erenia Penayo de Sanabria, by a former manager of the company (the complainant organization enclosed with its own complaint a copy of the complaint lodged with the national police, alleging violence at the workplace of a certain severity).
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that the member in question is still working at the company and that the complaint of physical assault lodged by Ms Juana Erenia Penayo de Sanabria against a former manager of the company (police case file No. / of  May ) did not give rise to a police investigation, as it was an offence punishable exclusively through private prosecution, in accordance with article () of the Criminal Code  the criminal prosecution of the matter shall depend on a request by the victim  ? The Committee notes this information and understands that, while Ms Juana Erenia Penayo de Sanabria lodged a complaint with the national police, she did not lodge a criminal complaint with the judicial authority. Consequently, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.

.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union freedoms both in law and in fact; this Committee is therefore convinced that, as the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning the substance of the allegations made against them [see First Report of the Committee, para. ]. The Committee expects that in the future the Government will actively cooperate by providing the information or observations requested.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee finds itself obliged to reiterate the recommendations it made when it examined this case at its meeting in November  [see th Report, para. ].
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee again invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not provided the information requested or adopted the measures requested, and requests the Government to actively cooperate in the procedure in the future.(b) The Committee again urges the Government to take the necessary measures to initiate without delay an investigation into the alleged dismissals of the other two trade union officials, the transfer of SOECAPASA general secretary, Gustavo Acosta, and the mass transfer of workers following peaceful demonstrations held in order to inform the general public of the company s situation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard. It also requests the Government, in consultation with the social partners, to ensure effective national procedures for the prevention or sanctioning of anti-union discrimination.(c) The Committee again urges the Government to keep it informed with regard to the investigation carried out following the complaint lodged with the national police concerning the assault against the worker, Juana Erenio Penayo.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Workers and Employees of Caas Paraguayas SA (SOECAPASA), the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Paraguay (CESITEP), the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) and the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT) dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  May , SOECAPASA, CGT, CESITEP and CPT state that the enterprise Caas Paraguayas SA (CAPASA) has committed serious infringements of freedom of association. According to the complainants, the alleged acts date from July , when a number of union members were dismissed, including four who enjoyed security of employment by virtue of their trade union status. The General Secretary of the union, Mr Gustavo Acosta, was subsequently transferred.
.The complainants add that although two of the union officials dismissed (Antoln Noguera and Erwin Alamada) obtained a court injunction ordering their reinstatement, the employer has high-handedly disregarded this in a manner that shows contempt for duly constituted authorities. The complainants also state that they have made their complaints known to all the competent authorities but have received no reply. The competent ministry convened a tripartite meeting which was attended by all the parties, but no agreement was reached because the employer had no wish whatsoever to resolve the problem.
.The complainants also allege that in addition to the anti-union acts referred to, there have been instances of verbal and physical assault suffered by one woman member, Juana Erenio Penayo, at the hands of the manager of the operational recruitment department. The CAPASA is in a critical situation. It has some  employees, which makes its operating costs very high in relation to its production, and because of this there have been peaceful demonstrations during break periods aimed at drawing public attention to the company s situation. This is what has prompted the company to carry out mass transfers of workers including some who enjoy trade union protection.
.In its communication of June , the Government states that CAPASA informed two workers, Antoln Noguera and Erwin Alamada, that they had been reinstated and an agreement to that effect had been signed. The company notes that in view of the company s critical economic and financial situation, which had been exacerbated by the hiring of new workers by the previous management, the new management was now obliged to carry out restructuring and lay off a number of employees who did not have a specific function. All of this was in accordance with current labour legislation. Lastly, the company indicates that since  July , when the new management took over, no new hiring has taken place.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant organizations allege various acts of anti-union discrimination at the CAPASA. Specifically, they allege the dismissal of four trade union officials (in relation to which the judicial authority is said to have ordered reinstatement which was not implemented), the transfer of Mr Gustavo Acosta, General Secretary of SOECAPASA, and the mass transfer of workers following peaceful demonstrations held to inform the general public of the company s situation, as well as physical assaults against one woman worker, Ms Juana Erenio Penayo de Sanabria, by a company manager (the complainant organization supplies a copy of the complaint lodged with the national police).
.The Committee notes that according to the Government, the company has reported that: () Antoln Noguera and Erwin Alamada have been reinstated and an agreement to that",1,2008,Paraguay
47,"effect has been signed; () in the light of the company s critical economic and financial situation, which was exacerbated by the hiring of new staff by the previous management, the new management has been obliged to carry out restructuring, laying off employees without a specific function; all of this is consistent with current labour legislation and regulations; and () since  July , when the new management took over, there has been no new hiring.
.The Committee recalls that no one should be subjected to discrimination or prejudice with regard to employment because of legitimate trade union activities or membership, and the persons responsible for such acts should be punished and that protection against anti-union discrimination should apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities outside working hours or, with the employer s consent, during working hours [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to initiate an investigation without delay into the alleged dismissals of other trade union officials, the transfer of SOECAPASA General Secretary, Gustavo Acosta, and the mass transfer of workers following peaceful demonstrations carried out in order to inform the general public of the company s situation and further requests the Government, in consultation with the social partners, to ensure effective national procedures for the prevention and sanctioning of anti-union discrimination.
.The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to the investigation carried out following the complaint lodged with the national police regarding the physical assault against Juana Erenio Penayo.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for the principle that processes of rationalization and staff reduction should involve consultations or attempts to reach agreement with the trade union organizations concerned.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to initiate an investigation into the alleged dismissals of the other two trade union officials, the transfer of SOECAPASA General Secretary, Gustavo Acosta, and the mass transfer of workers following peaceful demonstrations held in order to inform the general public of the company s situation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard. It also requests the Government, in consultation with the social partners, to ensure effective national procedures for the prevention and sanctioning of anti-union discrimination.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to the investigation carried out following the complaint lodged with the national police concerning the assault against Juana Erenio Penayo.",1,2008,Paraguay

.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government, if the judicial authority confirms that union official Ms Shirley Marisol Rojas was dismissed from INTERBANCO SA for anti-union reasons, to take the necessary measures to ensure that she is reinstated in her post, or a similar post corresponding to her abilities, and paid any arrears of wages owed to her. If the judicial authority considers that reinstatement is not possible, the Committee expects that she will receive adequate compensation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",0,2006,Paraguay

.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September and  October .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the allegations examined at its November  meeting referred to dismissals, suspensions, transfers and warnings against workers of the National Electricity Authority (ANDE) and other acts of anti-union discrimination (suspension of payment of bonuses, intimidation and threats of dismissal and suspension and restrictions on the use of trade union leave) following two strikes in January and February .
.In this respect, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the strikes in question were declared illegal by the courts of first instance, but that the Supreme Court of Justice issued precautionary measures ordering the suspension of the dismissals, suspensions, transfers and warnings. The Committee also notes that the Government states that in the framework of this conflict various agreements were made: () on  June , SITRANDE and ANDE came to an agreement with regard to the granting and use of trade union leave; () on  March , the Government and workers' organizations agreed that there would be no dismissal, severance, labour separation, transfer or change in employment conditions of workers of ANDE for having participated in the strikes in , and collective agreements on labour conditions in the public sector would be given effect; and () recently, SITRANDE and ANDE had set up a round table for social dialogue and bargaining through which a number of agreements had been concluded.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the agreements made between SITRANDE and ANDE not to sanction workers for their participation in the strikes of January and February  are given full effect. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of all steps taken to implement these agreements and, in particular, to keep it informed of developments with regard to the reinstatement of the  dismissed workers, the suspension of  and the transfer of  workers.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the agreements made between the trade union SITRANDE and the National Electricity Authority (ANDE) not to sanction workers for their participation in the strikes in January and February  are given full effect.(b) The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of all steps taken to implement these agreements and, in particular, to keep it informed of developments with regard to the reinstatement of the  dismissed workers, the suspension of  and the transfer of  workers.
.The present complaint is contained in communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Trade Union of Workers of the National Electricity Authority (SITRANDE) dated  August and  October .
.Since no reply was received from the Government, the Committee was obliged on two occasions to postpone its examination of this case. At its meeting in May-June  (see the th Report, paragraph ), the Committee issued an urgent appeal and drew the Government s attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it may present a report on the substance of this case, even if the Government s complete observations or information have not been received in due time. To date the Government has not sent its observations.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their respective communications of  August and  October , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Trade Union of Workers of the National Electricity Authority (SITRANDE) allege acts of anti-union discrimination, violations of the right to strike and interference by senior managers of the National Electricity Authority (ANDE).
.As regards the alleged violation of the right to strike, the complainants state that SITRANDE has carried out two strikes. The first, lasting  hours, was called on  January  in protest at the failure to implement an agreement between the Government and the Trade Union and Social Front (which encompasses the main public-sector trade unions). The second, which lasted  days, began on  February  and was motivated by a failure to implement a collective agreement and by the presence of police on company premises for the purpose of intimidating workers. During the strike, about  workers were dismissed, and  staff members of ANDE were dismissed subsequently.
.Both the strikes in question were ruled by the courts to be illegal. In the first case, this was because of the organizers' failure to give due strike notice to the Ministry of Justice and Labour, although ANDE had been informed. An appeal was lodged against this ruling in the Supreme Court, which ruled the appeal admissible, thereby suspending the measures taken against the strikers by the lower courts. Despite this, in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling, ANDE initiated  summary proceedings as a result of which  workers were dismissed, another  were suspended,  were transferred and hundreds of others were given warnings. SITRANDE again appealed against these measures before the Supreme Court, which issued interim rulings on  June and  and  July ordering the suspension of the dismissals, suspensions, transfers and warnings; there has to date been no response from ANDE. At the same time, the labour courts ordered the reinstatement in their former posts of nine trade union officers, but despite this, ANDE transferred them. The workers in question disregarded this decision and as a result, summary administrative proceedings were initiated and payment of their wages was stopped.
.The complainants allege that ANDE is waging a campaign of discrimination against SITRANDE by paying special bonuses to trade unionists who did not join the strike.
.They also allege that, when the union announced its intention to begin talks with ANDE, the latter refused to recognize the nomination of one member of the SITRANDE negotiating committee on the grounds that he had been dismissed by the company. The complainants also allege that the company, in a harsh internal clampdown, has decided that trade union officers will be required to clock in and out of the workplace and request special leave to go out on trade union business, under penalty of having their wages withheld.
.The complainants allege further that the dismissed workers are picketing in front of the ANDE central office and that other workers who come to express their solidarity suffer intimidation and threats of dismissal or suspension. They also allege that pressure is brought to bear on members to make them leave SITRANDE.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the complaint was first presented, the Government has not responded to any of the allegations made by the complainants, despite the fact that it has been urged on a number of occasions to send its observations or information on the case, including through an urgent appeal. The Committee urges the Government to cooperate fully with the Committee in the future.
.In these circumstances, in accordance with the applicable procedural rule [see para.  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee finds itself obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without being able to take into account the information it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union freedoms in law and in fact. The Committee is convinced that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side must recognize the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such allegations made against them. [See the Committee s First Report, para. ].
.The Committee notes that the complainants have alleged dismissals, suspensions, transfers and sanctions against workers employed by the National Electricity Authority for having participated in the strikes of  January and  February , as well as the refusal to recognize one member of the union s negotiating committee and acts of intimidation against workers at the company to force them to leave the union.
.As regards the allegations of dismissals, suspensions, transfers and warnings against workers for participating in the strikes, the Committee notes that, according to section  of the Paraguay Labour Code, strikes in the electricity supply sector are permitted on condition that minimum services are maintained. The Committee notes that, according to the information supplied by the complainants, the strikes of  January and",0,2000,Paraguay
50," February were declared illegal under the anti-strike law adopted as part of the state reform programme; the first strike was declared illegal because of the failure by the organizers to meet the notification requirements, in that they notified ANDE and not the Ministry of Justice and Labour; the complainants do not indicate the reasons for which the second strike was declared illegal. The Committee notes that the Supreme Court, in decisions handed down on  June and on  and  July, temporarily suspended all the measures adopted previously by the lower courts against the strikers, and notes with concern that even after these rulings, ANDE initiated  summary proceedings resulting in the dismissal of  workers, the suspension of  workers, the transfer of  workers and hundreds of warnings being issued. At any event, the Committee recalls that arrests and dismissals of strikers on a large scale involve a serious risk of abuse, and place freedom of association in grave jeopardy. The competent authorities should be given appropriate instructions so as to obviate the dangers to freedom of association that such arrests and dismissals involve [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to mediate between the parties with a view to enabling them to achieving a joint negotiated settlement of this dispute.
.As regards the allegations that special bonuses were paid to workers who had not taken part in the strike, the Committee has taken the view, when examining other similar allegations, that such discriminatory practices constitute a major obstacle to the right of trade unionists to organize their activities [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to carry out investigations into these allegations and, if it is established that the allegations are true, to ensure that there is no repetition of such acts in future within the administration.
.With regard to the refusal to recognize one of the members of the union s negotiating committee (Mr. Trinidad) because he had been dismissed by the company, the Committee recalls that, given that workers' organizations are entitled to elect their representatives in full freedom, the dismissal of a trade union leader, or simply the fact that he leaves the work which he was carrying out in a given undertaking, should not affect his trade union status or functions unless stipulated otherwise by the constitution of the trade union in question [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that ANDE does not oppose the nomination of the deputy general secretary.
.As regards the restrictions with regard to the use of trade union leave, the Committee recalls that legal provisions should not infringe the basic guarantees of freedom of association, nor should they sanction activities which, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association, should be considered as legitimate trade union activities [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that no unnecessary restrictions are placed on normal trade union activities.
.Lastly, with regard to the alleged anti-union practices against workers in the form of intimidation, threats of dismissals and suspensions, and pressure put on workers to make them leave their trade unions at the National Electricity Authority, the Committee recalls that such practices are contrary to Article  of Convention No. , according to which workers' and employers' organizations should enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other s agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to carry out an investigation to establish the facts and to provide its observations in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded to any of the allegations made by the complainants, and urges the Government to cooperate fully with the Committee in the future.(b) As regards the allegations of dismissals, suspensions, transfers and warnings against workers for participating in the strikes, the Committee requests the Government to mediate between the parties with a view to enabling them to achieving a joint negotiated settlement of this dispute.(c) As regards the allegations that special bonuses were paid to workers who had not taken part in the strike, the Committee requests the Government to take necessary steps to carry out investigations into these allegations and, if it is established that these allegations are true, to ensure that there is no recurrence of such acts in future within the administration.(d) With regard to the refusal to recognize one of the members of the union s negotiating committee, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that ANDE does not oppose the nomination of the deputy general secretary.(e) As regards the restrictions with regard to the use of trade union leave, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that no unnecessary restrictions are placed on normal trade union activities.(f) Lastly, with regard to the alleged anti-union practices against workers in the form of intimidation, threats of dismissals and suspensions, and pressure put on workers to make them leave their trade unions, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to carry out an investigation to establish the facts, and to provide its observations in this respect.",-1,2000,Paraguay
51,".The Committee last examined this case at its October November  meeting and recalls that it is related to the trial and sentencing for the crime of  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade union confederations: the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT), the United Confederation of Workers (CUT) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP), Mr Gernimo Lpez (who died in hiding and as a fugitive from justice), Mr Alan Flores (who resides abroad as a fugitive from justice) and Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina [see st Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee noted with concern that the judicial proceedings concerning Mr Barreto Medina, instituted two decades ago, had not yet been completed since the Public Prosecutor s Office had filed appeals against the decisions that had granted him conditional release and declared his sentence null and void. The Committee expressed the firm hope that the judicial proceedings concerning Mr Barreto Medina would be concluded soon and requested the Government to inform it of its outcome.
.By a communication dated  March , CESITEP indicates that in October , the Fourth Criminal Chamber of Appeals reported that a new Court of Appeal had been set up with respect to the conditional release granted to Mr Barreto Medina. CESITEP further alleges that the Government prohibited the National Police from renewing Mr Barreto Medina s passport and that this would prevent him, among other things, from attending a congress abroad as President of CESITEP. CESITEP indicates that Mr Barreto Medina is an active and supportive member of society, is a rector and professor of a university, President of CESITEP and also holds other relevant positions, so any challenge to the parole, granted in , makes no sense whatsoever since his reintegration into society is not in question. In a communication dated  August , CESITEP recalls that the judicial proceedings concerning Mr Barreto Medina began  years ago and that this has meant a long ordeal for the leader and his family.
.In communications dated  January ,  December, , and  January and  March, , the Government indicates that: (i) Mr Barreto Medina applied for a passport on  April, , the passport was issued on  April and collected on  April with the corresponding legalisations; (ii) Mr Barreto Medina left the country with the passport in April  and (iii) by means of Interlocutory Orders Nos  and  dated  October, , the Court of Criminal Appeals of Asuncin, Fourth Chamber, declared the study of the general appeals filed by the Public Prosecutor s Office against the Interlocutory Order that had granted conditional release to Mr Barreto Medina in  and against the Interlocutory Order that had declared the sentence to be null and void in  to be inoperative; (iii) by means of Interlocutory Orders Nos  and  dated  October, , the Court of Criminal Appeals of Asuncin, Fourth Chamber, declared that the study of the general appeals that the Public Prosecutor s Office had filed against the Interlocutory Order that had granted conditional release to Mr Barreto Medina in  and against the Interlocutory Order that had declared the sentence to be null and void in , served no purpose.
.The Government attached a copy of Interlocutory Orders Nos  and  in which the Court of Appeals recalls that: (i) in , Mr Barreto Medina was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years; (ii) by Interlocutory Order dated  July, , parole was granted to the convicted person, and a period of probation of two years was set; (iii) since Mr Barreto Medina had complied with the rules of conduct that were imposed when he was granted parole, on  July  the Judge decided that the sentence imposed on Mr Barreto Medina should be declared null and void; and (iv) without prejudice to the foregoing, the Court of Appeal of the Fourth Chamber never ruled on the general appeals filed by the Public Prosecutor s Office against the Interlocutory Orders dated  July  and  July . In Interlocutory Orders Nos  and  dated  October , the Court of Appeals stated that: (i) Mr Barreto Medina had complied with the rules of conduct imposed on him and the study of the general appeal filed by the Public Prosecutor s Office against the ruling that had granted conditional release to Mr Barreto Medina in , should be declared to serve no purpose; and (ii) in , the enforcing judge found sufficient grounds to have declared the sentence null and void, for which reason he declared that the study of the general appeal filed by the Public Prosecutor s Office against the ruling, in which it was decided that the sentence in  was null and void, served no purpose.
.The Committee takes due note of the information provided by the complainant organization and by the Government. The Committee understands that, from the information provided by the Government, it appears that the judicial proceedings concerning Mr Barreto Medina, which had been pending for more than two decades and which the Committee expected to be completed, were finally concluded in October , it having been declared unnecessary to consider the appeals filed by the Public Prosecutor s Office against the rulings that had granted him conditional release and the sentence to be null and void. While regretting the delay in the application of justice, the Committee expresses its satisfaction that the judicial proceedings concerning Mr Barreto Medina had finally concluded. Based on the foregoing, and pending the necessary notifications in this regard being made to all relevant national authorities and the leader continuing to perform his functions as President of CESITEP without hindrance, the Committee considers that the present case is closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The Committee last examined this case, relating to the trial and sentencing for  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade union confederations, the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT), the United Confederation of Workers (CUT) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP), Mr Gernimo Lpez, Mr Alan Flores and Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina, at its March  meeting [see st Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee lamented Mr Gernimo Lpez s death while in hiding and as a fugitive from justice, and expressed its regret that Mr Alan Flores continued to reside abroad as a fugitive from justice and that the Public Prosecutor s Office had appealed against the decisions granting Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina conditional release and quashing his sentence. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the status of the proceedings against the union leaders, including the outcome of the appeal of the Public Prosecutor s Office against the decision quashing Mr Barreto Medina s sentence.
.The Committee notes that, by communications of  May  and  June , CESITEP indicates that the proceedings against the three presidents of the trade union confederations, which had commenced  years ago, had not yet concluded, and that since  the Public Prosecutor s Office had been appealing against the decisions granting conditional release and quashing the sentence of Mr Barreto Medina. CESITEP emphasizes that, without prejudice to the fact that Mr Barreto Medina was convicted in  and received a four-year custodial sentence, since  Mr Barreto Medina has spent: (i) two years and two months under house arrest at the CESITEP premises; (ii) eight years on parole with strict rules of conduct; (iii) eight months as a political prisoner in the Tacumb prison; and (iv) the last seven years on conditional release with drastic rules of conduct, including not being able to leave the country unless authorized by the judge.
.The Committee expresses its regret at the fact that the Government has not sent any communications on the case since it was last examined. It also notes with concern that, according to the information provided by the complainant organization, the judicial proceedings concerning Mr Barreto Medina, which commenced two decades ago, have not yet been concluded. The Committee notes that this situation has reportedly arisen as a result of the appeals lodged by the Public Prosecutor s Office against the decisions ordering his conditional release and quashing the sentence.
.The Committee considers that, when appeals are lodged against decisions ordering conditional release and quashing a sentence, as is the case with Mr Barreto Medina, the proceedings must be conducted without delay. Noting with concern the -year delay in the judicial proceedings, the Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee firmly expects the judicial proceedings to be concluded shortly and requests the Government to inform it of the outcome.
.The Committee last examined this case, relating to the trial and sentencing for  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade",-1,2000,Paraguay
52,"union confederations, the United Confederation of Workers (CUT), the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP), Mr Alan Flores, Mr Gernimo Lpez and Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina, at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to: (i) send its observations concerning the communications of CESITEP (reporting that Mr Alan Flores continued to take refuge in Argentina and that, after serving more than two-thirds of the four year sentence imposed on him, Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina was granted parole, but the Public Prosecutor s Office challenged that decision); and (ii) ensure that Mr Alan Flores was able to return to Paraguay without being arrested in connection with those proceedings. The Committee recalls that on previous examinations of the case, it had deeply deplored the fact that judicial proceedings had gone on for more than ten years, and had taken note that in  an ILO mission had visited Paraguay in connection with the case and had stated on that occasion, among other things, that  the court of first instance violated the principle of nullum crimen sine lege, which prohibits applying criminal law retroactively, and the sentence was handed down on the basis of a rule of criminal law promulgated after the acts at issue took place' and that  the accused have served a substantial part of the terms of imprisonment imposed by the court of first instance' [see nd Report, para. ]. The Committee again reiterated the importance of ensuring that those trade union officials were not subject to criminal sanctions, including imprisonment.
.In the follow-up to the case, the Committee takes note of the following information provided by CESITEP, in communications dated  September ,  May,  June,  September and  November ,  May  and  May : (i) reporting further abuses of power and prevarication by the judicial authorities, as well as anti-union harassment, and irregularities in the process through which the union leaders were sentenced, which had gone on for more than  years; (ii) reporting in September  on the persecution of, and arrest warrant for, Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina, claiming that both he and another union leader, Mr Florencio Florentn, should have obtained release without supervision but had not been granted it; (iii) claiming that, despite the fact that on  August  Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina had fully served his sentence, it was not then ruled that his sentence had in fact been fully served and the case subsequently remained open so as to comply with the alleged  probationary period' (a legal concept used to impose a further sentence through a probationary period of two years); (iv) claiming that, although Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina s sentence was finally terminated and his final discharge granted through resolution No.  dated  September , that resolution was appealed by the Public Prosecutor s Office on  September ; (v) reporting that with regard to this complaint, a formal complaint was submitted to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (CIDH) against the State of Paraguay, processed as case No. ; (vi) challenging the allegations from the Government of corruption regarding the case and defending the union leaders' handling of the actions that led to their convictions; (vii) deploring both the death in hiding of the president of the CTP, Mr Gernimo Lpez, due to a lack of medical assistance, as well as the political exile of the president of the CUT, Mr Alan Flores; and (viii) requesting a direct contacts mission to the country.
.Furthermore, the Committee takes note of the following information provided by the Government in communications dated  March and  July , and  June , indicating that: (i) Mr Alan Alberto Flores is a fugitive from justice and is residing in Argentina, where he has applied for political asylum; (ii) Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina was granted parole on  July , and on  September  his sentence was declared terminated, but the Public Prosecutor s Office appealed this decision as an appeal against the decision to grant parole to the union leader, lodged by the same Public Prosecutor s Office, remained unresolved; and (iii) Mr Gernimo Lpez Gmez, while a fugitive from justice, passed away in September  (according to information provided to the Government by the CTP).
.The Committee regrets the allegations regarding the death while in hiding and as a fugitive from justice of the president of CTP, Mr Gernimo Lpez; the situation of Mr Alan Flores, residing abroad as a fugitive from justice; and that the Public Prosecutor s Office has appealed the decisions to grant Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina parole and to declare his sentence terminated. The Committee can only firmly reiterate its previous recommendations and request that the Government keeps it informed in this regard, as well as regarding the result of the appeal from the Public Prosecutor s Office against the decision to terminate the sentence of Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina.* * *

.The Committee last examined this case, relating to the trial and sentencing in the first instance for  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade union confederations, the United Confederation of Workers (CUT), the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP), Mr Alan Flores, Mr Jernimo Lpez and Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina, at its November  meeting [see nd Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion the Committee deeply deplored the fact that these proceedings have gone on for more than ten years and recalled having noted at the time that an ILO mission had visited Paraguay in connection with the case and on that occasion had stated among other things that  the court of first instance violated the principle of nullum crimen sine lege, which prohibits applying criminal law retroactively, and the sentence was handed down on the basis on a rule of criminal law promulgated after the acts at issue took place' and that  the accused have served a substantial part of the terms of imprisonment imposed by the court of first instance' [see nd Report, para. ]. The Committee stated that, as it understood matters, the officials in question were for the time being at liberty ' as the Committee had requested at the time ' although a court sentence hung over them. The Committee again reiterated the importance of ensuring that these trade union officials",-1,2000,Paraguay
53,"were not subject to criminal sanctions including imprisonment.
.In a communication of  November , CESITEP, the CUT, the CPT and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) report that without any form of notification to their counsel, in proceedings that have lasted for more than  years, the executing judicial authority ordered the arrest of the trade union officials (Mr Barreto Medina has been in Tacumb jail since  November where he faces all manner of health risks and Mr Alan Flores has applied for political asylum in Argentina). In a communication of  April , CESITEP reports that Mr Barreto Medina is still in prison five months later, which brings the time he has served up to two years and eight months, which should entitle him to parole and that Mr Alan Flores is still a refugee in Argentina. By a communication of  May , CESITEP states that the Government agreed to mediation by the Inter American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in order to look for common ground and explore possibilities for an amicable solution with the claimants, and that they have accordingly been invited to take part in a forum for dialogue, but that the Government seeks only to prolong the process. CESITEP adds that Mr Barreto Medina has already been imprisoned for seven months, that he has completed two-thirds of the four-year sentence, that the prison officers describe his conduct as exemplary, yet despite all this he has not been granted the parole that section  of the Penal Code entitles him to. In its communication of  October , the CESITEP informs that, on  July, the trade union leader Barreto Medina was released on probation but that the Public Prosecutor has appealed the decision.
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to send its observations concerning the communications of the CESITEP. It also requests the Government to ensure that Mr Alan Flores is able to return to Paraguay without being arrested in connection with these proceedings.
.The Committee last examined this case, relating to the trial and sentencing in the first instance for  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade union confederations, the United Confederation of Workers (CUT), the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP), Mr Alan Flores, Mr Jernimo Lpez and Mr Rinaldo Barreto Medina, at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, it requested the Government to inform it of the status of judicial proceedings against the trade union officials in question, and to indicate whether any further appeals had been lodged in the case.
.In a communication dated  June , the CESITEP, the CUT, the CPT and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), state that in these proceedings, which have been going on for more than  years, without any reliable factual basis or foundation in criminal law, and which according to the Attorney-General s Office prescribed in , the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the first instance sentences handed down in respect of the union officials in question without informing the complainants of the involvement of the Criminal Division. Due to the alleged violations of due process and human rights, the complainant organizations request that an ILO direct contacts mission be sent to the country.
.The Committee notes this information and regrets the lack of a response from the Government. The Committee deeply deplores the fact that these proceedings have gone on for more than ten years. The Committee recalls having noted at the time that an ILO mission had visited Paraguay in connection with this case, and having stated on that occasion among other things that  the court of first instance violated the principle of nullum crimen sine lege, which prohibits applying criminal law retroactively, and that the sentence was handed down on the basis of a rule of criminal law promulgated after the acts at issue took place'  and that  the accused have served a substantial part of the terms of imprisonment imposed by the court of first instance' [see nd Report, para. ]. Under these circumstances, it is the Committee s understanding that the officials in question are, at least for now, at liberty ' as the Committee had requested at the time ' although a court sentence still hangs over them. The Committee once again reiterates the importance of ensuring that these trade union officials are not subject to criminal sanctions including imprisonment.
.The Committee last examined this case, relating to the trial and sentencing in the first instance for  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade union confederations, the United Confederation of Workers (CUT), the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP), Mr Alan Flores, Mr Jernimo Lpez and Mr Barreto Medina, at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee deeply deplored the significant amount of time that had elapsed since the initiation of legal proceedings (more than  years), urged the Government to take all the necessary measures to ensure that the legal proceedings would be concluded in the very near future and requested it to ensure that the guarantees of due process were respected. The Committee also requested the Government to keep it informed of the final ruling handed down in the case.
.In its communication of  June , the Government indicates that: () the case before the law courts of Paraguay is entitled:  Edgar Cataldi et al. on charges including fraud'  () Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina, Mr Alan Flores and Mr Jernimo Lpez, jointly with other accused persons, submitted a petition for the limitation of actions against final judgement No.  of  October , handed down by the criminal judge of justice enforcement No. ; () on  June , the Criminal Court of Appeal, First Division, handed down decision and ruling No.  consisting of a total of  pages, and in its judgement the petitions for limitations were rejected and the remedy of annulment dismissed; and () the remaining points of the first instance judgement appealed against were upheld (decision and ruling No.  of  October ). To conclude, the sentence handed down by the judge of first instance remains in force.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the status of judicial proceedings against the trade union officials in question, and to indicate whether any further appeals have been lodged in the case.
.The Committee last examined this case, relating to the trial and sentencing in the first instance for  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade union confederations, the United Confederation of Workers (CUT), the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP), Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Barreto Medina, at its November  session [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee regretted the significant amount of time that had elapsed since the initiation of legal proceedings (almost ten years), expressed the hope that the proceedings would be concluded in the near future and requested the Government to inform it of the final ruling handed down in relation to the trade union officials in question.
.In a communication of  May , CESITEP indicates that it lodged an appeal requesting the admission of new facts, which was rejected by the Supreme Court of Justice, and that a motion was filed to terminate the criminal proceedings based on the provisions of the Pact of San Jos de Costa Rica on the grounds of the duration of the proceedings, which was also rejected. In a communication of  August , CESITEP recalls that: () the criminal proceedings were initiated  years ago; () although the ILO recommended the Government to take measures to declare the legal proceedings null and void on the grounds that serious irregularities had been found in those proceedings, the judicial authority has not handed down a decision; and () no settlement of the case, which is currently in the second instance, is in sight, undermining the human rights of the officials and notwithstanding the fact that the State Attorney-General s Office has stated that the proceedings are already time-barred (according to the Attorney-General s Office, the five-year period provided for in law has already expired). In a communication of  September , CESITEP alleges that the Chamber of Appeals ordered that a single decision should be handed down incorporating the motion on time limitation and the final judgement and that this constitutes a serious injustice for the union officials by creating an impediment to the legitimate right to know the court s decision regarding the motion to terminate the proceedings, denying the right to lodge an appeal against the decision that is handed down, and ultimately denying the right to legal defence.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has",-1,2000,Paraguay
54,"not sent its observations in relation to the communications of CESITEP that date back to . The Committee deeply deplores the significant amount of time that has elapsed since the initiation of legal proceedings (more than  years). The Committee urges the Government to take all the necessary measures to ensure that the legal proceedings will be concluded in the very near future and requests it to ensure that the guarantees of due process are respected. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final ruling that is handed down in this case.
.The Committee last examined this case, relating to the trial and sentencing in the first instance for  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade union confederations, the United Confederation of Workers (CUT), the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP), Mr Alan Flores, Mr Jernimo Lpez and Mr Reinaldo Barreto Medina, at its meeting in June  [see th Report, paras  and ]. On that occasion, the Committee had expressed the hope that due process of law would be respected in the framework of the judicial proceedings initiated against the trade union officials and that the proceedings would be concluded in the near future and had requested the Government to send its observations without delay on the communication dated  June  from CESITEP, which reported that the criminal proceedings had not been concluded and alleged further violations of procedural rights in the second instance (in particular the failure to produce the evidence requested to follow up on a development in the second instance).
.In a communication dated  June , the Government reported that the judicial case in question had been initiated in March  following an investigation into the administration of the National Workers' Bank (BNT). In the ruling handed down in first instance, the then judge Hugo Lpez had sentenced  persons to terms of imprisonment of ten, seven and four years for their part in the embezzlement of bank assets, those persons including the former bank president, who received the maximum sentence, along with the other former bank administrators. An appeal was lodged against the ruling before the Appeals Chamber. The trade unionists who were sentenced have sought to have the legal proceedings annulled on the grounds that they related to debt. For that purpose, they presented as alleged new facts the cases brought by the bankrupted BNT against the CESITEP, CUT and CPT, which had expired. After several months of investigation, the appeal was rejected by the court, and the defence again appealed against that decision. This was also unsuccessful on the grounds that the period allowed had elapsed, and the plaintiffs then appealed again in mid-. Faced with this situation, the Appeals Chamber referred the case to the Supreme Court of Justice, which means that examination of the original sentences has again been postponed until the appeal is decided. It is worth noting that, in December , Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina applied to the court to suspend the precautionary measures imposed on them (house arrest), basing their application on article  of the National Constitution and on sections ,  and others of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The First Chamber of the Criminal Court of Appeal upheld the application and consequently suspended the measures imposed on the trade union officials, ordering them to report any change of address or travel outside the country in writing to the courts and to the police.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee regrets the significant amount of time that has elapsed since the initiation of legal proceedings (almost ten years), expresses the hope that the proceedings will be concluded in the near future and requests the Government to inform it of the final ruling that is handed down in relation to the trade union officials in question.
.The Committee last examined this case concerning the trial and sentencing in the first instance for  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade union confederations, CUT, CPT and CESITEP, Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Barreto Medina, at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee noted that, on  December , the judicial authority had cancelled the preventive detention of the trade union officials in question, who were currently at liberty, and expressed the hope that the judicial proceedings initiated against the trade union officials would be concluded in the near future. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the final ruling handed down in this case.
.In a communication dated  June , the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP) reported that the criminal proceedings had not been concluded and alleged further violations of procedural rights in the second instance.
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the complainant organization and regrets that the Government has not communicated its observations on the matter. The Committee expresses the hope that due process of law will be respected in the framework of the judicial proceedings initiated against the trade union officials, and that the proceedings will be concluded in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final ruling handed down in this case and to send its observations without delay concerning the communication from CESITEP dated  June .
.The Committee last examined this case, concerning: () the trial and sentencing in first instance for  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade union confederations CUT, CPT and CESITEP, Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina; and () the dismissal of trade unionist Florinda Insaurralde [see nd Report, paras. -], at its meeting in November . On that occasion, it made the following recommendations: (a)  the Committee deeply regrets the long delay taken by the Court of Appeal to make its ruling and reiterates its previous recommendations. Accordingly, it strongly urges the Government once again to take immediate action to secure the release of trade union leaders Reinaldo Barreto Medina, Jernimo Lpez and Alan Flores. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken to that end'  and (b)  the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent the observations requested concerning any proceedings filed by Florinda Insaurralde against resolution No. / and Decree No. /, which led to her dismissal, and once again requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect' 
.In communications dated  March and  May , the complainant organizations refer to the slowness of the judicial process (which began in June ) and to certain irregularities during that process. In a communication dated  September , the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP) states that Ms. Florinda Insaurralde has died.
.In a communication dated  December , the Government states, in relation to the allegations concerning the trial of the trade union leaders Jernimo Lpez, Alan Flores, and Reinaldo Barreto Medina, that the case against  Edgar Cataldi and others on charges including fraud' began in March  following an investigation into the administration of the National Workers' Bank (BNT). In the ruling handed down in first instance, the then judge Hugo Lpez sentenced some  persons to terms of imprisonment of ten, seven and four years for their part in embezzling bank assets, those persons including the former bank president Edgar Cataldi, who received the maximum sentence, along with the other former bank administrators. The judge in his ruling concluded that losses incurred by the bank as a result of this amounted to  billion guaranes. An appeal was lodged against the ruling before the Appeals Chamber. The trade unionists who were sentenced have sought to have the legal proceedings annulled on the grounds that they related to debt. After several months of investigation, the appeal was rejected, and the defence again appealed against that decision. This was also unsuccessful on the grounds that the period allowed had elapsed, and the plaintiffs then appealed again in mid-. Faced with this situation, the Appeals Chamber referred the case to the Supreme Court of Justice, which means that examination of the original sentences has again been postponed until the appeal is decided. The Government adds that, in December , Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina applied to the court to suspend the precautionary measures imposed on them (house arrest), basing their application on article  of the National Constitution and sections ,  and others of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The First Chamber of the Criminal Court of Appeal on  December  upheld the application and consequently suspended the measures imposed on the trade union officials, leaving the workers concerned at liberty but ordering them to report any change of address or travel outside the country in writing to the courts and police.
.The Committee takes note of the information communicated by the complainant organization and",-1,2000,Paraguay
55,"the Government. In particular, the Committee notes with interest that, on  December , the judicial authority cancelled the prevention detention of the trade union officials in question, who are currently at liberty. The Committee expresses the hope that the judicial proceedings initiated against these trade union officials will be concluded in the near future, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the final ruling handed down in this case.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee last examined Case No. , concerning: () the trial and sentencing in the first instance for  breach of trust' of the three presidents of the trade union confederations CUT, CPT and CESITEP, Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina; and () the dismissal of trade unionist Florinda Insaurralde [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee formulated the following recommendations:The Committee notes the fact that the trade union leaders Alan Flores and Jernimo Lpez are currently under house arrest. However, taking into account its previous comments, the serious flaws in the legal proceedings concerning the two trade union leaders noted in the previous examination of the case, the time gone by since the sentence was handed down in the first instance (over one year) without the relevant appeal having been decided, and the fact that the accused have already served the minimum sentence imposed on them in the first instance, the Committee profoundly regrets that no measure has been taken to release Reinaldo Barreto Medina, Jernimo Lpez and Alan Flores. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take measures to this end and hopes that a decision will be handed down in the very near future on the judicial appeals filed and that they will take into account the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any proceedings that Florinda Insaurralde may bring against resolution No. / and Decree No. /, which led to her dismissal.
.In the context of the follow-up to these recommendations, in communications dated  February,  April and  June , the complainants requested the International Labour Office to field a mission to note further flaws in the legal proceedings concerning the accused trade union leaders (alleging further delays in handling requests for release, extremely slow progress on the appeal filed against the sentence handed down in the first instance in October , etc.). Moreover, in a communication dated  July , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) joined the complaint, stating that: (a) while a person guilty of committing an offence should be duly punished, the proper functioning of the judicial system is an essential prerequisite; (b) the judicial branch must be wholly independent and adhere to the procedures laid down in the national legislation, in full compliance with Convention No. ; and (c) due account should be taken of the Committee s recommendations in the judicial proceedings. In a communication dated  April , the Government of Paraguay accepted the complainants' proposal for a follow-up mission to visit Paraguay in connection with these allegations.
.In this respect, the Committee has been informed that: () the court of first instance violated the principle of nullum crimen sine lege, which prohibits applying criminal law retroactively, and the sentence was handed down on the basis of a rule of criminal law promulgated after the acts at issue took place; and () the accused have served a substantial part of the terms of imprisonment imposed by the court of first instance (in the case of Mr. Barreto Medina, over half his sentence), and there is no firm prospect of any improvement in the state of the proceedings against the trade union leaders in the short or medium term (release requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the trade union leaders, a ruling by the Court of Appeal on the appeal filed in October ), given that the Court of Appeal has stated that, according to the statutory time limits on the proceedings, a ruling on the appeal filed in October  will not be handed down before December  or the beginning of .
.The Committee emphasizes that due process of law should include the non-retroactive application of the criminal law, and that the right to a fair and rapid trial is among the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the normal exercise of trade union rights [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ]. In these circumstances, and in the light of the information received, the Committee deeply regrets the long delay taken by the Court of Appeal to make its ruling and reiterates its previous recommendations. Accordingly, it strongly urges the Government once again to take immediate action to secure the release of trade union leaders Reinaldo Barreto Medina, Jernimo Lpez and Alan Flores. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measure taken to that end.
.Lastly, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent the observations requested concerning any proceedings filed by Florinda Insaurralde against resolution No. / and Decree No. /, which led to her dismissal, and once again requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras. -], on which occasion it formulated the following recommendations:(a) Taking into account the serious flaws in the legal proceedings, both procedural and of substance, and in particular the lengthy duration of the pre-trial detention, as well as the fact that there was a denial of justice since no tribunal ruled on the requests for conditional or final release of trade union leaders, the Committee believes that all necessary measures should be taken to ensure the release of Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina. Furthermore, the Committee hopes that the judicial bodies will speed up the proceedings, requests the Government to keep it informed of any judicial decision issued in this respect, and hopes that these decisions will be made in accordance with Conventions Nos.  and .(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any proceedings that Florinda Insaurralde may bring against resolution No. / and Decree No. /, which led to her dismissal.
.In a communication of September , the complainant organizations criticize the conditions under which the trade union leaders Alan Flores and Jernimo Lpez are detained (a dirty and badly lit dungeon) and allege that their lives had been threatened in their place of detention. They also allege that the Judge of First Instance of the Criminal Courts violated constitutional provisions by recently refusing to liberate the abovementioned trade union leaders for having served part of the sentence imposed on them.
.In its communication of  September and  October , the Government states with regard to the legal proceedings concerning Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina that: () in order to hear the appeal against the sentence handed down in the first instance, as well as the appeal against other decisions, the Second Chamber of the Criminal Court of Appeal has been constituted; () the members of the Chamber of the Court of Appeal are collectively in the process of reading the entire content of the file and have taken measures in order that the appeal be resolved shortly; and () the criminal judge of justice enforcement No.  handed down a ruling to liberate Alan Flores and Jernimo Lpez for having served the minimum sentence and to apply substitute measures (house arrest) instead of preventive detention.
.The Committee notes this information and, in particular, the fact that the trade union leaders Alan Flores and Jernimo Lpez are currently under house arrest. However, taking into account its previous comments, the serious flaws in the legal proceedings concerning the two trade union leaders noted in the previous examination of the case, the time gone by since the sentence was handed down in the first instance (over one year) without the relevant appeal having been decided, and the fact that the accused have already served the minimum sentence imposed on them in the first instance, the Committee profoundly regrets that no measure has been taken to release Reinaldo Barreto Medina, Jronimo Lpez and Alan Flores.
.Lastly, the Committee reiterates its recommendation concerning the dismissal of Florinda Insaurralde and that it be kept informed of all motions filed.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, on which occasion it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras. -].
.In a communication dated  June , the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT), the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP) presented a complaint containing allegations relating to this case. Subsequently, new allegations and further information were received in communications dated  August,  and  September,",-1,2000,Paraguay
56," October,  and  December .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  November  and  January .
.At its March  meeting, the Committee noted that the Government had accepted the proposal formulated by the complainant organizations to the effect that a direct contacts mission visit the country in order to gather information and prepare a report so that the Committee could examine the case with all the elements at its disposal [see th Report, para. ]. In this respect, the direct contacts mission took place in Asuncin from  to  March . It was led by Dr. Jaime Malamud Goti, Professor of Ethics, University of San Andrs, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and University of Arkansas, United States, and former Professor of Criminal Law, Faculty of Law and Social Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The report of the direct contacts mission is attached as Annex I.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the report of Dr. Jaime Malamud Goti of the direct contacts mission. The Committee expresses its thanks for the technical information submitted, which will allow it to examine this case with additional elements of information.
.The Committee notes that the trade union organizations CUT, CPT and CESITEP state that anti-union persecution of the presidents of these organizations (Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina) led to their being tried and sentenced to imprisonment by the Criminal Court of First Instance for being accessories to a breach of faith during the bankruptcy of the National Workers' Bank (BNT). Moreover, the Committee notes that the complainant organizations state that there were irregularities in the proceedings.
.The Committee notes that the Government confirms that the trade union officials were tried in the criminal courts for fraudulent asset-stripping of the BNT and that they were sentenced to imprisonment for seven and four years and that it states that: (i) all legal requirements for the proceedings were observed and that the judicial process took place without any involvement from the State; and (ii) the defendants were tried under the procedural guarantees laid down in the National Constitution, the Penal Code and the Procedural Penal Code.
.Nonetheless, the Committee notes that the report of the direct contacts mission confirms that there were serious procedural flaws (also with regard to the fundamental legal questions) in the legal proceedings involving the presidents of the trade union organizations. The report summarizes these flaws as follows:(a) With regard to the procedural matters, the following measures seem inappropriate:
.However, regarding the allegation of the trial and sentencing of the presidents of the trade union organizations in question by the Criminal Court of First Instance being a result of anti-union persecution, the Committee notes that the report of the direct contacts mission states, as follows:With regard to the social and political context of anti-union discrimination alleged by the complainant organizations to the ILO, it should be pointed out that:
.In these circumstances, and taking into account the serious flaws that took place in the legal proceedings, both procedural and of substance, and in particular the lengthy duration of pre-trial detention, as well as the fact that there was a denial of justice since no tribunal issued a decision concerning the requests of provisional or final release of the trade union leaders, the Committee believes that all necessary measures should be taken to ensure the release of Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina. Furthermore, the Committee hopes that the judicial bodies will speed up the legal proceedings, requests the Government to keep it informed of any judicial decision issued in this respect, and hopes that these decisions will be made in conformity with Conventions Nos.  and .
.Finally, the Committee notes that, when it examined this case at its March  meeting, it had requested the Government and the complainant organization to forward additional information concerning the dismissal of Florinda Insaurralde. In this respect, the Committee notes the Government s statement that, following an official complaint by the Director of the Maternity and Paediatric Hospital of the Paraguayan Red Cross, the legal office of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare carried out an administrative inquiry, the results of which led to the decision to dismiss the employee under resolution No. / and Decree No. /. In these circumstances, at the same time as it regrets that the complainant organization has not sent additional information (when the complaint was presented it indicated only that there had been a dismissal solely on the basis of the employee s involvement in labour claims and her defence of the rights of other colleagues), the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any proceedings that Florinda Insaurralde may bring against the resolution and the Decree that led to her dismissal.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Taking into account the serious flaws in the legal proceedings, both procedural and of substance, and in particular the lengthy duration of pre-trial detention, as well as the fact that there was a denial of justice since no tribunal ruled on the requests for conditional or final release of trade union leaders, the Committee believes that all necessary measures should be taken to ensure the release of Alan Flores, Jernimo Lpez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina. Furthermore, the Committee hopes that the judicial bodies will speed up the proceedings, requests the Government to keep it informed of any judicial decision issued in this respect, and hopes that these decisions will be made in accordance with Conventions Nos.  and .(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any proceedings that Florinda Insaurralde may bring against resolution No. / and Decree No. /, which led to her dismissal.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the Workers' Union of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (SITRAMIS) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP). CESITEP sent further information in a communication dated  October . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the communications of  May and  October , the Workers' Union of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (SITRAMIS) and the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP) stated that a general strike was called for  May  by the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP), the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT), the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), and the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT), in response to the following: (a) the fulfilment of the agreement signed by the Government within the framework of social dialogue; (b) the participation of trade unions in the reform process of the State; (c) the withdrawal of Congress from the privatization plan for public bodies; (d) the regulation and payment of medical insurance to civil servants and the fulfilment of Decree No. /; (e) the payment of the family bonus; (f) the depoliticization of the Ministries of Public Health and Social Welfare and of Education and Culture; (g) the fulfilment of the labour laws; (h) the rapidity of labour cases brought before the court and the resolution of cases taking into account the standards of the ILO; and (i) the end of union persecution. The complainant organizations indicate that in reaction to the proposed strike the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare carried out a persistent, stubborn, unjustified and immoral persecution of a number of civil servants who were active union members, including Mr. Christian Weiler, the Secretary-General of the Workers' Union of LACIMET and Ms. Marcia Rivas de Gmez, who were transferred, and Ms. Florinda Insaurralde, who was dismissed, solely on the basis of their involvement in the labour claims and their defence of the rights of other colleagues.
.The complainant organizations state that the strike was temporarily called off when the Government promised to look into the claims of the trade unions. However, the Minister of Public Health and Social Welfare arranged for the arbitrary transfer of the Chairperson of the Decentralized Council of SITRAMIS of Itapa, Ms. Marcia Rivas de Gmez, from the city of Encarnacin to the small community of San Juan del Paran. In response to this, a day of protest in front of the regional hospital of the city of Encarnacin was planned for  May  where an incident took place between the police and the civil servants who were protesting peacefully, wherein the police attacked Dr. Reinaldo Barreto Medina, the Chairperson of SITRAMIS and CESITEP, who was detained.
.The complainant organizations state that the prosecutors involved brought a suit of ""alleged punishable offence against the public administration"" (resisting",0,2000,Paraguay
57,"the authorities) against Dr. Reinaldo Barreto Medina, under which he was detained. This detention order was reversed by the court, and Dr. Barreto Medina was released through lack of evidence. CESITEP attaches a copy of the records of the case during which it appears that the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare and Dr. Reinaldo Barreto Medina agreed, within the framework of the trial, to request conditional suspension of proceedings based on the fact that the accused agreed to provide dental services at a hospital every Saturday morning for one year. The judge ruled to accept the agreed request.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that the alleged transfer of Mr. Christian Weiler, was ordered (temporary transferral) under Resolution D.G.R.H. No.  of  July  by Health Centre Central Laboratory No. , in the XVIII Sanitary Region. This transfer took place as part of the reorganization of the Ministry, which, owing to a budgetary shortfall for that year, was forced to redistribute human resources in order to carry out changes in the new administration and to reorganize services. As Mr. Weiler was an experienced civil servant, particularly in the area of national resources, he was sent to Health Centre No.  to organize the area and thus implement such services and take inventory of the institution. Subsequently, Mr. Weiler turned up at Health Centre No.  only once to work and then did not appear in the workplace again. An administrative inquiry was initiated and copies of the institution's timesheets showed absence from work and therefore presumed abandonment of his post. Following the conclusions of the administrative inquiry, Mr. Weiler was dismissed from his post by Decree No.  of  January . The Government emphasizes that according to the report of the chief of the section on collective relations and union membership, to be found in the records of the case, Mr. Weiler did not have union protection.
.As regards Ms. Florinda Insaurralde, the Government states that she was disciplined by dismissal under Decree No.  of  January  as the result of an administrative inquiry begun in July  in which she was accused of problems in her working relationships with her superiors and work colleagues (interfering in duties other than her own, using the telephone at work for personal matters, threatening her work colleagues, etc.).
.As regards Ms. Marcia Rivas de Gmez, the Government states that she was transferred to the Health Centre in San Juan del Paran, two kilometres from her home, on  May  as part of a national immunization day. Taking into account this event, the management of the VII Sanitary Region asked for the transfer of Ms. Marcia Rivas de Gmez from the regional hospital of Encarnacin to the Health Centre in San Juan del Paran, belonging to the same Sanitary Region, until  May . This transfer was ordered under Resolution D.G.R.H. No.  of  May , taking into account article  in fine of Resolution S.G. No. , Decree No.  that authorizes the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare to exercise general administration of the institution and be responsible for human resources, and article , subsection (E), of Law No. / ""The Civil Servant's Statute"". Furthermore, the sanitary region of Itapa had asked for Ms. Marcia Rivas de Gmez to be transferred to San Juan del Paran as it was impossible to recruit people to conduct the national immunization day because of lack of funds for contracts and, due to this, a lack of human resources. Furthermore, the Government indicates that the size of the sanitary region of Itapa, where there are a number of health centres and clinics that lack the human resources to achieve a  per cent rate of immunization, should be taken into account.
.As regards the assault and detention of Mr. Reinaldo Barreto Medina, Chairperson of CESITEP, the Government indicates that according to the police this union leader physically attacked the chief police superintendent, Rogelio Bentez Nuez (chief of public order and security), for which he was temporarily detained, for an alleged punishable offence against public administration, as laid down in article , subsection , of the Penal Code. Mr. Barreto Medina was released under A.I. No.  of  May  by the judge of the criminal court of the third judicial district of Paraguay.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant organizations have alleged that following a call to strike for  May , the authorities of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare started an anti-union persecution of civil servants who were active union members, transferring Mr. Christian Weiler, Secretary-General of the Workers' Union of LACIMET and Vice-President of SITRAMIS, Ms. Marcia Rivas de Gmez, Chairperson of the Decentralized Council of SITRAMIS of Itapa, and dismissing Ms. Florinda Insaurralde. The Committee also notes that the complainant organizations have alleged physical assault, detention and prosecution of Mr. Reinaldo Barreto Medina, Chairperson of SITRAMIS, during a protest carried out on  May .
.As regards the transfer of Mr. Christian Weiler, Secretary-General of the Workers' Union of LACIMET and Vice-President of SITRAMIS, the Committee notes that the Government has indicated that: () Mr. Weiler was sent (temporary transfer) to the Health Centre Central Laboratory No.  on  July ; () his transfer took place within the framework of the reorganization of the Ministry as a result of a budgetary shortfall and with the aim of reorganizing services; () Mr. Weiler turned up only once to work at the Health Centre No.  and an administrative inquiry was initiated, which indicated his non-appearance and his abandonment of his duties; and () Mr. Weiler was dismissed from his duties under a resolution made in January  following the conclusion of the case. In this respect, the Committee notes that although the transfer in question occurred long before the conflict reported in this case, Mr. Weiler held two union positions and the Committee does not exclude the fact that the transfer in question might have affected his ability to carry out his activities as a leader. In these circumstances, the Committee emphasizes that ""one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom."" [See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paragraph ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that this principle is respected.
.As regards the transfer of Ms. Marcia Rivas de Gmez, Chairperson of the Decentralized Council of SITRAMIS of Itapa, the Committee notes that the versions presented by the complainant organizations and by the Government are contradictory. The complainant organizations indicate that the transfer was an act of anti-union persecution following the call to strike on  May ; the Government indicates that the union leader in question was transferred from the city of Encarnacin to the Health Centre of San Juan del Paran in the framework of the national immunization day of  May  because it was impossible to hire personnel to help organize that day and the health clinic lacked personnel. In these circumstances, although the transfer took place eight days after the call to strike, the Committee does not have sufficient information to confirm that the transfer in question occurred for anti-union reasons, particularly in light of the fact that according to the Government the union leader in question was transferred back to her original position in the city of Encarnacin on  July .
.As regards the physical assault, detention and prosecution of Mr. Reinaldo Barreto Medina, Chairperson of SITRAMIS, during the protest of  May , the Committee notes that according to the Government the union leader in question assaulted a police authority (the chief police superintendent), for which he was temporarily detained and released on  May . In this respect, the Committee notes that according to the records of the case against Dr. Barreto Medina for resistance to authority, a copy of which the complainant organizations have attached, the Ministry of Public Health and the accused agreed to request the judge for a conditional suspension of proceedings in exchange for the accused providing dental services at a hospital on Saturday mornings for a period of one year, and the judge agreed to this request. Under these circumstances, the Committee",-1,2000,Paraguay
58,"will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the dismissal of Ms. Florinda Insaurralde, the Committee notes that according to the Government she was dismissed from her job following the conclusions of an inquiry which began in July  in which she was accused of interfering in duties other than her own, using the institution's telephone for personal matters and threatening her colleagues. In these circumstances, taking into account that the worker in question was dismissed for reasons which took place long before the conflict reported in this case and that the complainant organizations did not indicate whether the person involved held a union position, the Committee requests the Government and the complainants to forward additional information in order to clarify this matter.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that it respects the principle that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures, and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions, and that such a guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.(b) Concerning the dismissal of Ms. Florinda Insaurralde, the Committee requests the Government and the complainants to forward additional information in order to clarify this matter.",1,2000,Paraguay
59,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Workers' Union of the National Radio of Paraguay (SINFURANP) dated  December . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  December , the Workers' Union of the National Radio of Paraguay (SINFURANP) states that ever since the union was created, the authorities of the institution have refused to recognize the union and enter into dialogue with it and have carried out a series of harassment actions against its members. Specifically, the complainant organization states that in this context: () the Secretary-General of the union, Mr. Juan Carlos Castro, and his deputy, Mr. Walter Gmez were dismissed under a resolution made on  October ; () union members, Messrs. Nunila Genes, Miguel Soloaga, Carlos Rubn Ojeda, Felipe Rosana Morales and Lido Morales were transferred; and () the freedom of expression of union members was restricted as a number of members were forbidden to carry out their duties as radio announcers.
.In its communication of  January , the complainant organization states that following a strike to protest against dismissals, time cards were seized and the salaries for October, November and December , and the Christmas bonus were not paid to those workers that took part in the strike.The Government's reply
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that as regards the alleged dismissal in October  of the Secretary-General of the Workers' Union of the National Radio of Paraguay, Mr. Juan Carlos Castro, and his deputy, Mr. Walter Gmez, as well as the transfer of a number of union members by signed agreement in January , it proposed: () the definitive reintegration to their previous positions and with the same conditions, of those union leaders dismissed; and () the reinstatement to their positions of those union members transferred (the Government attaches a copy of these documents).
.The Government adds in relation to the other alleged incidents that: () union members' freedom of expression was not restricted as union members had not been forbidden to carry out their duties as radio announcers; () at no time were the time cards seized from the workers; () the salaries for October, November and December , and the Christmas bonus were paid in January ; the delay in payment was due to budgetary problems and not to anti-union reasons.
.Finally, the Government states that in order to find a peaceful solution to this case it intervened in the National Radio and named a new director. Currently, management of the National Radio of Paraguay has friendly and excellent relations with all workers at the institution and applies an open policy of permanent dialogue.
.The Committee observes that according to the complainant organization the Secretary-General and his deputy were dismissed, a number of union members of the National Radio of Paraguay were transferred in October , and other anti-union acts, such as forbidding union members to carry out their duties as radio announcers, seizing time cards and non-payment of salaries for October, November and December , as well as the Christmas bonus, to workers who participated in a strike in support for those dismissed, were carried out.
.In this respect, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government that: () under an agreement concluded in January  (a copy of which is annexed to the Government's reply), union leaders who had been dismissed were finally reinstated to their former positions and union members who had been transferred were returned to their posts; () the non-payment of salaries for October, November and December , and the Christmas bonus, was due to budgetary problems and not to anti-union discrimination, and those salaries were finally paid in January ; () at no time were union members forbidden to carry out their duties as radio announcers, nor were the time cards of workers who took part in a strike, in support of those who had been dismissed, seized; and () in order to find a peaceful solution to the conflict a new director was named for the National Radio and currently there is a friendly and excellent relationship between management and workers at that institution.
.The Committee nevertheless observes that in this case the National Radio of Paraguay carried out dismissals and anti-union transferrals as is confirmed in the agreement of January  concluded between the parties, which the Government annexed to its reply, wherein it is expressly agreed that union persecution will cease. The Committee notes these facts with regret and recalls in this respect the principle that ""no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ]. However, the Committee welcomes the fact that the parties arrived at an agreement which allowed the conflict to be satisfactorily resolved. The Committee therefore considers that this case requires no further action.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1999,Paraguay
60,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting and on that occasion submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has twice had to postpone the examination of this case. Therefore, at its March  meeting [see th Report, para. ], the Committee issued an urgent appeal to the Government drawing its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it may present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting even if the information and observations of the Government have not been received in due time. To date the Government has not sent its observations.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its March  meeting, following its examination of the allegations concerning the transfer and dismissal of trade union officials, as well as of the threat to dissolve the CESITEP and dismiss its president, Mr. Barreto Medina, the Committee formulated the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government: () to keep it informed of the result of the appeal lodged before the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic in respect of the transfer of Ms. Blanca Alvarez; () in the proceedings of the administrative inquiry into Mr. Rigoberto Gmez s failure to observe his obligations, to verify the charges made against him and, if these are related to the exercise of his trade union activities, to take the necessary measures to have him reinstated in his job. In addition, the Committee requests the Government and the complainants to forward additional information with respect to the allegations concerning the threats to dissolve the trade union CESITEP and to dismiss Mr. Barreto Medina, president of CESITEP.
.The Committee regrets the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed since the last examination of this case, the Government has not sent the information requested, although it has repeatedly been urged to do so, including by means of an urgent appeal. In accordance with the applicable rule of procedure [see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is obliged to submit a report on the substance of the case without being able to take into account the information it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. If this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies concerning the substance of the allegations brought against them [see First Report of the Committee, para. ].
.With regard to the alleged anti-union transfer of the trade union official Ms. Blanca Alvarez, the Committee urges the Government to ascertain whether the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic has handed down a decision in this respect, and if it has been concluded that her transfer was a result of her trade union status or the exercise of legitimate trade union activities, to take the necessary measures to have her reinstated in her job without loss of pay.
.Concerning the dismissal of the trade union official Mr. Rigoberto Gmez, the Committee once again urges the Government to verify the grounds for his dismissal and if these are related to the exercise of his trade union activities, to take the necessary measures to have him reinstated in his job, without loss of pay.
.Lastly, with respect to the alleged threat by the Government to dissolve the trade union CESITEP and to dismiss Mr. Barreto Medina, its president, the Committee regrets that neither the Government nor the complainant organizations have sent the additional information requested.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee, regretting that it has not received the information repeatedly requested, urges the Government to ascertain whether the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic has handed down a decision concerning the alleged anti-union transfer of the trade union official Ms. Blanca Alvarez, and if it has been concluded that her transfer was a result of her trade union status or the exercise of legitimate trade union activities, to take the necessary measures to have her reinstated in her job without loss of pay.(b) The Committee once again urges the Government to verify the grounds for the dismissal of the trade union official Mr. Rigoberto Gmez, and if these are related to the exercise of his trade union activities, to take the necessary measures to have him reinstated in his job, without loss of pay.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP) dated  June . CESITEP sent additional information in a communication dated  July . Public Services International associated itself with the complaint in a communication dated  June . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  June and  October .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP) alleges that the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare failed to comply with a collective agreement governing working conditions. That agreement was signed on  April  between the Ministry and its workers' trade union, ratified by a commitment document and officially approved by the Ministry of Justice and Labour. To date, the Ministry of Health refuses to respond to workers' requests to comply with it, even violating Decree No.  regulating the Public Health Code (the Health Act), which governs administrative careers within the Ministry of Health; it also ignores the hierarchical structure, only promoting officials in one specialized area and discriminating against others, and not allowing the trade union, despite the fact that the collective agreement so provides, to participate in the preparation of salary scale reclassifications. Moreover, considerable anti-union discrimination has recently become apparent in the Ministry of Health, which refuses to deduct the premiums for medical insurance directly from the wages of trade union members, but allow deductions from wages to be made for medical insurance premiums for private enterprises providing pre-paid medical care.
.The complainant also alleges that the commitment document signed on  May  between the Government, represented by the Ministry of Justice and Labour, and the Trade Union Confederation of Employees has been violated. The document essentially contains the acknowledgement of a government debt to the Institute of Medical Insurance for State Employees (ISMSTE) and establishes the form in which it is to be paid. The ISMSTE is a workers' organization that provides medical assistance to CESITEP members.
.CESITEP also alleges acts of anti-union persecution against its officials by the Government. More specifically, it indicates that the Government is threatening reprisals, such as dissolving the organization through a ""revision"" of resolution No. / concerning registration and dismissing the president of the CESITEP, Mr. Barreto Medina (who in fact has not been paid since December ).
.In its communication dated  July , the Trade Union Confederation of State Employees of Paraguay (CESITEP) alleges that the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare has committed further acts of anti-union discrimination. These include, in particular, the following:- the transfer of trade union officials, Ms. Magdalena Duarte and Mr. William Jos Ledesma Acua, members of the executive committee of the Trade Union of the Medical Emergencies Clinic;- the refusal by the State Administration Office to comply with arrangements for the deduction of trade union dues for the Workers' Union of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (SITRAMIS);- the dismissal of trade union officials, Ms. Blanca Alvarez, Mr. Daro Matiauda and Mr. Rigoberto Gmez.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government denies violating the collective agreement governing working conditions in the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (it indicates that officials are being reclassified gradually and that medical insurance contributions are paid). It also denies violating the commitment document of  May .
.The Government adds that it is not true that it wishes to dismiss the president of the CESITEP, nor that he has not been paid. Mr. Barreto Medina did not claim his salary for the months of March, September, October and December , nor his Christmas bonus. However, he did collect his salary for the months of January and February  and then again did not claim his salary for March, April and May .
.In its communication of  October, the Government states with regard",0,1999,Paraguay
61,"to the allegation concerning the deduction of trade union dues for SITRAMIS, that the Administration Office of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare had deducted the trade union dues from SITRAMIS members and that the SITRAMIS representatives had received those dues. There has never been an interruption in these deductions.
.As regards the transfer of trade union officials Ms. Magdalena Duarte and Mr. William Jos Ledesma from the Medical Emergencies Clinic, the Government states that, in view of the inauguration on  June  of the Medical Emergencies Centre, ""Prof. Dr. Luis Mara Argaa"", situated in Asuncin, the former First Aid Clinic, had to be moved to the new premises. This change necessarily led to the redistribution of human resources in order to optimize them in accordance with the needs of the various services. For this reason, the Director-General of the Medical Emergencies Centre made Mr. William Ledesma and Ms. Magdalena Duarte available to the General Directorate of Human Resources on  July . Subsequently, following a decision taken on  August , Mr. William Jos Ledesma Acua was moved from the General Directorate of Human Resources to the district hospital of Lambar, to comply with a request submitted by the management of that institution, for his services in his capacity as debt collector as it was impossible to recruit new staff with experience in that occupation and Mr. William Ledesma had already performed that function at the Medical Emergencies Clinic. Mr. Ledesma's transfer is a temporary one.
.As regards the transfer of Ms. Magdalena Salvadora Duarte, the Government states that, bearing in mind the lack of available nursing staff, the limited recruitment budget and the high demand for such staff, she was transferred following a decision dated  August  from the General Directorate of Human Resources to the Mother and Child Care Clinic of Santsima Trinidad as that institution was situated close to her home. It was therefore not an anti-union move but a service-related one.
.On a general note, the Government states with regard to the alleged transfers that in  the Ministry of Health was allocated very limited funds for recruitment under the national budget which obliged it to move staff around as, in a number of institutions under the Ministry, the lack of available staff was causing serious problems. These moves or secondments were not isolated, and none of the seconded persons were obliged to perform tasks of less hierarchical importance, nor was there any uprooting. This being the case, the persons concerned were not wronged as they were not prohibited from exercising their trade union activities.
.As regards Ms. Blanca Alvarez, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Government states that she was the subject of an administrative inquiry at that institution and that under Decree No. / she was dismissed from her duties (the inquiry concluded that the official had committed serious offences - improper use of the Ministry's premises and property, irregular attendance at the Ministry and lack of respect towards and insults directed at her superiors). The judicial authority amended Decree No. , ordering that the official be suspended from her work without pay for a period of  days. This case is currently pending before the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic.
.With respect to Mr. Daro Matiauda, an official of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, the Government states that he was dismissed following an inquiry and subsequently reinstated under Decree No.  of  July . Mr. Matiauda later requested leave without pay twice for a period of three months. These periods of leave were granted under resolution No.  of  October  and resolution No.  of  June .
.As regards Mr. Rigoberto Gmez Rivas, the Government indicates that following an inquiry he was dismissed from his duties under Decree No.  of  January  for having committed the offence stipulated in article () of Act No. / (failure to observe obligations).
.The Government states that it is untrue that it threatened to dissolve the trade union organization CESITEP through a revision of resolution No. /. Concerning the alleged failure to pay medical insurance, the Government indicates that the legal office of the Treasury issued Legal Opinion No.  dated  June  in respect of the CESITEP case. Following CESITEP's appeal for protection of its constitutional rights against the Treasury, the fourth circuit court of judicial protection handed down final ruling No.  of  June . The legal opinion and the ruling serve to explain why medical insurance benefits are paid to state employees on an individual basis.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainants allege: (i) the failure of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare to comply with the obligations set forth in a collective agreement and in a commitment document; (ii) the Ministry's refusal to allow the trade union to make the deductions for the payment of medical health insurance; (iii) threats to dissolve the trade union CESITEP and to dismiss Mr. Barreto Medina, president of the CESITEP (who has allegedly not been paid since December ); (iv) the transfer of trade union officials, Ms. Magdalena Duarte and Mr. William Jos Ledesma Acua, members of the executive committee of the Trade Union of the Medical Emergencies Clinic, and the dismissal of trade union officials, Ms. Blanca Alvarez, Mr. Daro Matiauda and Mr. Rigoberto Gmez; and (v) the refusal by the State Administration Office to comply with arrangements for the deduction of trade union dues for the Workers' Trade Union of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (SITRAMIS).
.With regard to the transfer of trade union officials, Ms. Magdalena Duarte and Mr. William Jos Ledesma Acua, members of the executive committee of the Trade Union of the Medical Emergencies Clinic, the Committee notes the Government's statement that: () in  the Ministry of Health had a very limited recruitment budget and this fact forced it to transfer staff and that these particular moves were not the only ones to occur; () as a result of the inauguration of the Medical Emergencies Centre ""Prof. Dr. Luis Mara Argaa"", the former First Aid Clinic had to be moved to new premises and that change resulted in needing to optimize human resources through redistributing staff; () Mr. William Jos Ledesma Acua was only transferred temporarily to the District Hospital of Lambar in order to carry out the function of collector (duties that he was already performing), as it was impossible to recruit new staff; and () Ms. Magdalena Duarte was transferred to the Mother and Child Care Clinic, owing to the lack of available nursing staff; when ordering the transfer of Ms. Duarte account was taken of the fact that the Mother and Child Care Clinic is situated near her home. In this regard, while taking due account of the budgetary problems that may have led the Ministry of Health to carry out transfers in order to fill vacant posts, the Committee cannot fail to observe that the workers in question held trade union positions and that their transfer may have affected the exercise of their trade union activities. The Committee, therefore, requests the Government to ensure that in future, when for budgetary or financial reasons it is necessary to carry out staff transfers in the public sector, due account is taken of the status of trade union officials, and that steps are taken to avoid any negative repercussions on the performance of their trade union activities and to avoid possible discrimination against them.
.As regards the dismissal of trade union officials Ms. Blanca Alvarez, Mr. Daro Matiauda and Mr. Rigoberto Gmez, the Committee notes the Government's statement that: () Mr. Matiauda, an official of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, was removed from office following an inquiry and subsequently reinstated under a decree dated  July ; () Ms. Blanca Alvarez, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was the subject of an administrative inquiry in which it was concluded that she had committed serious offences, such as improper use of the Ministry's premises and property, irregular attendance at work and lack of respect towards and insults directed at her superiors, which led to her dismissal from her post under Decree No. ; the judicial authority amended the decree, imposing on the official a suspension for a duration of  days, and the case is currently pending before the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic; and () Mr. Rigoberto Gmez, an official of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, was the subject of an administrative inquiry and was dismissed from his post for having committed the offence set forth in article () of Act No. / (failure to observe obligations). The Committee requests the Government to: () keep it informed of the result of the appeal lodged before the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic in respect of the transfer of Ms. Blanca Alvarez; and () in the proceedings of the administrative inquiry",0,1999,Paraguay
62,"into Mr. Rigoberto Gmez's failure to observe his obligations, verify the charges made against him and, if these are related to the exercise of his trade union activities, to take the necessary measures to have him reinstated in his job.
.With respect to the allegation concerning the refusal by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare to allow the trade union SITRAMIS to make deductions for the payment of medical health insurance, the Committee notes the Government's information that this matter was submitted to the judicial authority which in its ruling accepted the payment of medical insurance benefits to state employees on an individual basis.
.Concerning the threats to dissolve the trade union CESITEP and to dismiss Mr. Barreto Medina, president of the CESITEP (who has allegedly not been paid since December ), the Committee notes the Government's categoric denial of both allegations and its emphasis on the fact the Mr. Barreto Medina did not claim his salary for the months of March, September, October and December  and March, April and May , but that he did claim it for January and February . In view of the contradictory versions presented by the complainants and the Government concerning these allegations and the lack of details in the complaint, the Committee requests the Government and the complainants to forward additional information in this regard.
.In relation to the alleged refusal by the State Administration Office to accept requests for the deduction of trade union dues for the Workers' Trade Union of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (SITRAMIS), the Committee notes the Government's denial of these allegations and its statement that the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare has deducted the trade union dues of SITRAMIS members, that the trade union representatives have received those dues and that in fact there has never been an interruption in the deductions.
.With respect to non-compliance by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare with a number of obligations set forth in a collective agreement and a commitment document, the Committee notes the Government's denial that the instruments have not been complied with (for example, it states that there has been a gradual reclassification of officials and that medical insurance contributions are paid). In this respect, the Committee stresses generally the importance it accords to the principle that ""agreements should be binding on the parties"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ] and requests the Government to ensure compliance with the contractual obligations contained in the instruments in question.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to adopt the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that in future, when for budgetary or financial reasons it is necessary to carry out staff transfers in the public sector, due account is taken of the status of trade union officials, and that steps are taken to avoid any negative repercussions on the performance of their trade union activities and to avoid possible discrimination against them.(b) The Committee requests the Government: () to keep it informed of the result of the appeal lodged before the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic in respect of the transfer of Ms. Blanca Alvarez; () in the proceedings of the administrative inquiry into Mr. Rigoberto Gmez's failure to observe his obligations, to verify the charges made against him and, if these are related to the exercise of his trade union activities, to take the necessary measures to have him reinstated in his job. In addition, the Committee requests the Government and the complainants to forward additional information with respect to the allegations concerning the threats to dissolve the trade union CESITEP and to dismiss Mr. Barreto Medina, president of CESITEP.(c) As regards the alleged non-compliance by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare with a number of obligations set forth in a collective agreement and a commitment document, the Committee stresses generally the importance it accords to the principle that agreements should be binding and requests the Government to ensure compliance with the contractual obligations contained in the instruments in question.",-1,1999,Paraguay
63,".The complaint was submitted by a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  December . The ICFTU sent new allegations in communications dated  April and  May . The Government sent partial observations in a communication dated  April .
.In the absence of information from the Government on most of the questions pending, the Committee had to postpone its examination of this case on two occasions. Furthermore, at its meeting in March , the Committee drew the Government's attention to the fact that in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it would present a report on the substance of this case at its next meeting, even if it had not received the information and observations requested in due time (see th Report, adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ), para. ). To date, full information has still not been received from the Government.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  December , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that on  August , workers of the Trade Union of United Manual Workers of the Paraguayan Meat Exporting Enterprise (EXPCAR), with headquarters in the locality of Piquete Cu, launched a general strike concerning payment of the family bonus, overtime, night work, compulsory social insurance and the minimum legal wage. The strike was suspended by the workers on  August  after an agreement was reached with the employer. However, on  September  the strike was resumed for an indefinite period following the failure to implement the agreements reached. The ICFTU points out that the strikers took up positions at the plant and that on  October  the strike was violently suppressed, resulting in the injury of several workers. Orders were issued for the arrest of  trade unionists, including the Secretary-General. On  October  they were violently detained and sent to the National Penitentiary, and released on  November . Furthermore, six female members of the trade union, who were on a hunger strike, were hospitalized on  November  and had to receive intensive care due to the grave state of their health.
.The ICFTU furthermore alleges in its communication of  April  that one day before the strike convened by the national trade unions central organizations for  March , Mr. Gernimo Lpez Gmez, Secretary-General of the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT) was physically and verbally assaulted and threatened with a knife by a person named Arnaldo Rafael Acosta Getto and four other persons, who, acting on behalf of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, insulted and threatened him in the CPT headquarters. They warned that the strike of  March would be the last action carried out by the trade union since the Minister of Justice and Labour would take steps to dismantle the CPT.
.Finally, in its communication of  May , the ICFTU alleges that following a national strike convened for  and  May  by the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) - affiliated to the ICFTU - and the three other national trade union central organizations to protest against the economic policy of the Government of Paraguay, state security forces brutally suppressed a peaceful march by trade union leaders, peasants and students. The security forces detained around  persons, including Messrs. Alan Flores, President of the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) and Eduardo Ojeda, leader of the National Central Organization of Workers (CNT), who were savagely beaten by more than  police officers at the time of their arrest. They were subsequently released, after more than  hours of detention.
.In its communication of  April , the Government sent the documentation of the police and judicial authorities on the violent dispute which occurred between Messrs. Gernimo Lpez Gmez (Secretary-General of the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT)) and Arnaldo Rafael Acosta Getto (CPT secretary responsible for organization). According to this documentation, Mr. Lpez Gmez prevented Mr. Acosta from entering the CPT premises when a meeting was being held to discuss aspects relating to the strike of  March , resulting in an exchange of blows during which both persons concerned were injured. Both were arrested and subsequently released by the judicial authority.
.First of all, the Committee regrets that the Government has not furnished observations on most of the questions pending, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented and the fact that it was invited to make its comments and observations on various occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal.
.Under these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable rule of procedure (see para.  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee feels obliged to submit a report on the substance of this case without being able to take into account the information which it hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, while these procedures protect governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part must recognize the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward (see First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee notes with concern that in this case the complainant alleges different acts of violence, detentions and threats against trade unionists due to strikes.
.As regards the alleged assault of and threats made against Mr. Gernimo Lpez, Secretary-General of the CPT, the Committee notes that according to the police and judicial documentation sent by the Government, these acts of aggression were due to the CPT secretary responsible for organization, who was prevented from entering the CPT premises during a discussion of certain aspects of the strike scheduled for  March , resulting in injuries to both persons concerned. In this respect, the Committee recalls that it is not competent to examine questions concerning internal disputes within trade unions and concludes that this allegation does not call for further examination.
.As regards the alleged acts of repression in October  against workers participating in the strike at the EXPCAR enterprise (several persons injured and the detention of  trade unionists, who were subsequently released three weeks later), the Committee underlines the long period during which the trade unionists were detained and requests the Government to confirm that there are no pending criminal charges against them.
.As concerns the assault and detention of hundreds of persons - including Alan Flores, President of the CUT, and Eduardo Ojeda, a CNT leader - for more than  hours, as a result of a protest march held during a strike in protest against the economic policy of the Government at the beginning of May , the Committee deplores this use of violence and of massive detention but notes that the persons detained have now been released.
.In the absence of a reply from the Government concerning the allegations of attacks and detentions mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the Committee can only regret these actions by the authorities and request that the Government take steps to ensure that the security forces refrain from measures of violence and detention against workers exercising their legitimate trade union activities, and open inquiries into the alleged acts of violence. In this respect, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, para. ). The Committee also emphasizes that the detention of leaders of workers' and employers' organizations for activities in connection with the exercise of their right to organize and to strike is contrary to the principles of freedom of association and that measures depriving trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights (see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ).
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets that despite an urgent appeal, the Government has not sent its observations on the alleged acts of repression in October  against workers participating in the strike at the EXPCAR enterprise (several persons injured and the detention of  trade unionists, who were subsequently released after three weeks) and",0,1995,Paraguay

65,".The complaints in this case are contained in a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), dated  November  (Case No. ), and in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), dated  January  (Case No. ).
.Due to the absence of a reply from the Government regarding the allegations, the Committee had to defer the examination of these cases. At its June  meeting the Committee drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it would present a report on the substance of this case at its next meeting, even if the observations or information requested had not been received in due time (see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June ), para. ). To date, no information has been received from the Government.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.First, the Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not communicated the observations requested on the serious allegations brought against it, despite the time which has elapsed since the presentation of the complaint and despite the fact that it was invited to make comments and observations on several occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal.
.Under these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable rule of procedure (see para.  of the th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee finds itself obliged to submit a report on the substance of these cases even without the information it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in fact. The Committee in convinced that while the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, they must for their part recognize the importance of formulating detailed and factual replies concerning the substance of the allegations brought against them in order to permit an objective examination (see First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.With respect to Case No. , the Committee stresses the seriousness of the allegations which refer to a number of violations of trade union rights in the Eximpora Coffee Producing enterprise S.A., in a context in which there were serious infringements of labour legislation. As regards the fact that a strike called in June  had been declared illegal because the strikers had blocked the way to the enterprise, the Committee recalls that the exercise of the right to strike should respect the freedom to work of non-strikers when the legislation stipulates this, as well as the right of management of the enterprise to enter into the premises of the enterprise.
.As regards the arrest and trial of six trade union officials accused of trespassing on private property, kidnapping and making death threats, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the trial and to send it the text of the judgement so that it might express an opinion on charges brought against the trade union officials in full knowledge of all the facts.
.Concerning the other allegations (dismissal and eviction from their homes of trade union officials and members, failure to comply with an agreement signed by the enterprise, attempts to implicate a trade union official in a drugs traffic affair and refusal to allow a trade union official into the enterprise to carry out trade union functions), the Committee requests the Government to carry out urgently an inquiry on this matter in order to determine responsibilities and penalize any violation of trade union rights, as well as to take as soon as possible the necessary measures to allow any trade union official or member dismissed for their lawful trade union activities to be reinstated. Similarly, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that nobody should be dismissed or be subject to acts of anti-trade union discrimination on account of their lawful trade union activities and requests the Government to ensure respect for this principle in the future and keep it informed of the outcome of the above-mentioned inquiry.
.Concerning Case No. , the Committee considers that the mass dismissal of  workers - including seven officials - of the Paraguayan television broadcasting company, Teledifusora Paraguaya, after it had been set up and opened discussions with the enterprise, as well as threats of dismissal against those deciding to join the trade union, constitutes serious violations of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Paraguay, which stipulates that:
.Workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment.
.Such protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to -(a) make the employment of a worker subject to the condition that he shall not join a union or shall relinquish trade union membership;(b) cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities outside working hours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours.Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to reinstate the  trade union officials or members dismissed, to prevent future acts of anti-trade union discrimination and to keep it informed in this respect..As regards the presence of the police in the enterprise during the strike carried out in Paraguay Refrescos S.A. and to the injuries incurred as a result of the shots fired by the police during a protest march, the Committee deeply regrets these deplorable actions and requests that a judicial inquiry be carried out to determine responsibilities and punish the guilty. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect and draws its attention to the fact that ""the authorities should resort to calling in the police in a strike situation only if there is a genuine threat to public order; the intervention of the police should be in proportion to the threat to public order and governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to avoid the danger of excessive violence in trying to control demonstrations that might undermine public order"" (see th Report, Case No.  (Peru), para. ).

69,".This complaint was presented in a joint communication from the International Organization of Employers (IOE) and the Federation of Production, Industry and Commerce of Paraguay (FEPRINCO) dated  July .
.Since it had not received the Government's observations on the allegations, the Committee twice had to postpone its examination of this case. Consequently, at its May-June  Session the Committee drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in compliance with the procedures set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it would present a report on the substance of the case at its following session, even if the observations or information requested had not been received in due time (see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (June )). To date, no information has been received from the Government.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their joint communication of  July  the International Organization of Employers (IOE) and the Federation of Production, Industry and Commerce of Paraguay (FEPRINCO) claim that on  May , in an arbitrary manner and on the instructions of the Bicameral Committee of the National Congress, the headquarters of FEPRINCO was occupied and audio tapes, records of meetings and diskettes belonging to the employers' organization were seized. The irresponsibile and prejudiced decision was based on an anonymous communication to Senator Fernando Pfanne who asked the Chairman of the Bicameral Committee to have the premises searched immediately. The complainant organizations state that the search of the headquarters of the leading Paraguayan employers' organization constitutes a violation of the civil liberties essential to the ordinary exercise of trade union rights and that it is detrimental to the climate necessary for tripartism to prevail in the country.
.First, the Committee deeply regrets the fact that the Government has not sent the observations requested concerning the serious allegations made, despite the time that has elapsed since the complaint was lodged and the fact that it was asked to formulate its comments and observations on a number of occasions, including in an urgent appeal.
.In these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable procedural rule (see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee is obliged to present a report on the substance of this case without being able to take into account the information it was expecting to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part must recognize the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies relating to the substance of the allegations made against them (see st Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee notes that the allegations concern the search of the headquarters of FEPRINCO on  May  for the purpose of confiscating audio tapes, reports of meetings and diskettes from that employers' organization. It observes that, according to the complainants, the search and the confiscation of the documents and material mentioned were the result of an anonymous communication to a senator, who requested the Chairman of the Bicameral Committee to have the premises searched immediately.
.In this connection, the Committee recalls that the International Labour Conference declared in its resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties () that the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organizations must be based on respect for those civil liberties which have been enunciated, in particular in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and that the absence of these civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights. More specifically, the Committee would like to point out to the Government that the right to the inviolability of the premises of workers' and employers' organizations, which is an essential element of the rights recognized under Convention No.  has as ""an indispensable corollary (...) that the public authorities may not insist on entering premises without a judicial warrant authorizing them to do so"". (See Digest, , para. ; th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. ; th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ; and st Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. .) In this connection, the Committee condemns the search of the headquarters of FEPRINCO and the confiscation of documents and materials, both of which violate the fundamental rights of employers' organizations, and requests the Government to return immediately the documents and materials to FEPRINCO, and to conduct an inquiry in order to clarify the circumstances surrounding these actions and, where appropriate, to punish those responsible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this connection, and also requests it to ensure that in future there is full respect in the country of the right to the inviolability of the premises and property of employers' organizations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee condemns the search of the FEPRINCO headquarters and the confiscation of documents and materials, both of which violate the fundamental rights of employers' organizations, and requests the Government to immediately return the documents and materials to FEPRINCO, and to conduct an inquiry in order to clarify the circumstances surrounding these actions and, where appropriate, to punish those responsible.

70,".The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) lodged this complaint in a communication dated  May . It later sent additional information in a communication dated  July .
.Since it had not received the Government's observations on the allegations, the Committee twice had to postpone its examination of this case, and even had to address an urgent appeal to the Government at its March  meeting. The Government finally sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Paraguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) alleges in its communications of  May  and  July  that according to information received from its affiliate, the National Workers' Co-ordination (CNT), the rural sector trade unionist, Mr. Sebastin Larrosa, was killed whilst participating in the general strike held on  May  in Tacuara, San Estanislao. The complainant organization points out that the sole aim of the general strike was to question the Government on measures it was implementing and to seek solutions to major social problems, and also states that the widespread participation of all sectors and of all national trade union organizations in this protest reflected the seriousness of the situation. The complainant organization states that according to information which it had received, the legal authorities are conducting an inquiry to identify those responsible for the killing, and that despite the fact that a number of witnesses indicated a non-commissioned officer of the armed forces as being the author of the murder, the judge found the accused innocent.
.Furthermore, the CLAT reports that the National Workers' Co-ordination (CNT) and the United Workers' Centre (CUT) informed it that with no heed for the principles of freedom of association, the ""Bicameral Committee for the Investigation of Infringements"" decided to audit their accounts in an attempt to throw light on the acts of violence that occurred during the general strike. The complainant organization also refers to a communication from the CNT and the CUT, the text of which is attached to the complaint, addressed to the above-mentioned parliamentary committee, which states, inter alia, that with respect to the intention to audit their accounts in an attempt to throw light on the acts of violence that had taken place, in their opinion the police was solely responsible for those acts of violence, but that if necessary they would comply with a judicial intervention, reserving the right to challenge such intervention if they considered it violated the principles of freedom of association. Lastly, they stated that the accounts had nothing to do with the acts of violence, and that the representatives of the trade union organizations appeared before the parliamentary committee simply to give their version of the facts and that intervention, for no valid reason, in the internal affairs of the trade unions would set a dangerous precedent.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that with respect to the general strike that took place on  May , the Ministry of Justice and Labour, aware of its historic responsibility and in accordance with the Government's intention to ensure that the strike would pass without incident, set up an office to coordinate the strike and ensure it would take place in accordance with the provisions of the National Constitution and the Labour Code, which fully guarantee the right to peaceful strikes and the freedom to work (the Government attaches the relevant provisions). The purpose of this coordination centre was simply to ensure that the strike would pass without incident and without resulting in disputes and damage to the physical and material well-being of the workers, employers, police officers and any other persons. With this in mind the three trade union organizations were asked to appoint representatives to participate actively in the coordination process. Labour inspectors, fax equipment, telephones, transport and other means of communication were made available in an attempt to ensure that the strike, which according to statements made by its leaders, was based on social claims, did not become violent and thus undermine the exercise of this right, which in fact is unfortunately what happened.
.The Government states that none of the trade union organizations sent any representatives for the purpose of preventing and solving any possible disputes, and that perhaps if they had done so the acts of violence that caused physical and material damage and injuries to workers, employers, strikers and police officers may have been avoided, and which caused action being taken by the state bodies responsible for keeping the peace.
.With respect to the alleged acts of violence, the Government states that the strike began at midnight on  May, with a symbolic demonstration involving the three workers' trade unions, and with maturity being shown by both the police and the unionists, in a routine and peaceful manner. However, as the hours passed and the morning approached the situation deteriorated and became more complicated with the blocking of a major road linking the capital with both the interior of the country and the commuter suburbs surrounding the capital, with the burning of tyres, and many other acts that the Government had hoped could be avoided through its appeals and the office it had set up. In addition, a group of trade unionists closed the road linking the whole of the western region, the Chaco, with the remainder of the country by way of sit-down protests, the staking of posts, logs and other materials, in open violation of the rights to free passage and to work by those who did not support the strike. Given this situation, which considerably exceeded the boundaries of the workers' right to strike, attempts were made to reason with them to end their unlawful conduct, but they refused to respect constitutional and legal rights, even despite one attempt at mediation by the chairman of the Human Rights Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, thereby showing little awareness of the aims, scope and procedure that should govern a strike. The Government states that no repressive measures whatsoever were taken that were not in response to the senseless attitude of certain trade unionists who, in an attempt to impose their ideas by violently intimidating those persons who did not wish to join the strike, set up roadblocks, held sit-down protests, burnt tyres, shattered the windscreens of public transport vehicles with stones and even guns, scattered nails to puncture tyres and put pressure on the drivers and passengers of public transport vehicles to return to their homes.
.The Government notes that with respect to the dispersal of the demonstration held in Tacuara, department of San Pedro, it should be noted that according to eyewitnesses and to radio, television, press and police reports, the demonstrators were warned that in accordance with normal procedure they were not permitted to close the national road linking the country's entire northern region with the capital, the centre, the south and the east, due to the unlawfulness of such an act. Subsequently, having requested the demonstrators to leave the road, and given their steadfast refusal to see reason and comply with the law, an attempt was made to break up the demonstration using tear-gas. The demonstrators responded to this violently, throwing stones and other objects at the security forces, and it was then that the unfortunate incident occurred which resulted in Sebastin Larrosa losing his life.
.Pre-trial proceedings are currently under way in the investigation process into the death of this citizen. During these proceedings witnesses must testify and a series of legal steps must be taken to establish the truth; the plaintiff, the public prosecutor's representative and the representative of the accused must all participate. These criminal pre-trial proceedings are being carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Penal Procedure, which includes procedural remedies to nullify and correct any departure from the legal provisions.
.With respect to the allegation concerning a possible intervention by the parliamentary Bicameral Committee for the Investigation of Infringements in the affairs of the National Workers' Co-ordination and the United Workers' Centre, the Government states that the alleged intervention did not occur and that there is no serious evidence to indicate that it will do so, and therefore there is no need to discuss this matter.
.The Committee notes that the allegations concern the violent death of the rural sector trade unionist, Mr. Sebastin Larrosa, during his participation in a general strike held on  May  in Tacuara, San Estanislao, and also to the decision to look into the accounts of two trade union organizations in an attempt to throw light on the acts of violence that took place during the strike.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that during the strike in question a number of violent acts were carried out by the strikers (roadblocks, threats made to non-striking workers, shattering of windscreens of public transport vehicles) and that repressive measures were taken as a result of",0,1994,Paraguay
71,"these acts. Furthermore, the Committee takes note of the Government's claim that Mr. Larrosa died during a clash between security forces and a group of demonstrators.
.The Committee deeply deplores the death of this trade unionist and notes that both the complainant organization and the Government state that a judicial inquiry is being conducted to establish the facts. The Committee expresses the hope that this judicial inquiry will permit responsibility to be determined, the facts to be ascertained and the guilty parties to be punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial inquiry.
.As concerns the decision to look into the accounts of two trade union organizations in an attempt to throw light on the acts of violence that took place during the strike in question, the Committee notes the Government's claim that the intervention did not occur and that there is no serious evidence to seriously indicate that it will do so in the future. In this connection, since the Government did not expressly deny the possibility that an inquiry of this kind could occur in this or in other cases, and given that the parliamentary committee had initially decided to conduct an inquiry (although subsequently it did not go ahead), the Committee would like to recall the principle whereby ""searches of trade union premises should be made only following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority where that authority is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for supposing that evidence exists on the premises material to a prosecution for a penal offence and on condition that the search be restricted to the purpose in respect of which the warrant was issued"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ). Furthermore, in this specific case the Committee realizes the importance of conducting inquiries to shed light on the acts of violence, but does not consider the search of the trade union premises to be useful in this connection. Whatever the case may be, a search of this kind should only take place if a warrant has been issued by the judicial authority.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee strongly deplores the death of the trade unionist Mr. Sebastin Larrosa and expresses the hope that by way of the judicial inquiry currently being carried out it will be possible to determine responsibility, ascertain the facts and severely punish those guilty of committing this despicable act of violence. The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial inquiry.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for the principle whereby the search of trade union premises should only take place if a warrant has been issued by the judicial authority.",-1,1994,Paraguay
72,".The complaints in this case are contained in communications from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), dated  March and  April . In a communication dated  June , the International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) made a complaint with similar allegations. The Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Paraguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) alleges that the promulgation of Legislative Decree No. . of  March , establishing standards governing the election of leaders of workers' organizations infringed the provisions of Convention No. . The CLAT attaches the texts of the Decree in question which has more than  sections. More specifically, the CLAT states that under the Legislative Decree in question:- the appointment of the leaders of trade union organizations must be endorsed by at least  per cent of the valid votes cast in the last election;- the final list of candidates must be established by the D'Hondt system (with posts being distributed by simple majority);- the same rules would apply as regards the election of leaders of second and third degree organizations;- provision must be made in the internal rules of trade union organizations for the setting up of an electoral body (an electoral committee or court), which shall be the internal, free and independent authority responsible for the proper application of the electoral process;- candidates for election must be members of the trade union, may not be members of any other trade unions which are affiliated with the higher-level organization, no trade union sanction must be currently in force against them, and they must not have been found guilty of misappropriation of trade union funds or of electoral fraud;- there must be no financial support from enterprises, employers' associations or other groups, for specific candidates, or support from external sources or interference by political parties, religious bodies, state agents or other groups outside the field of workers' activities;- etc.
.The CLAT states that the Decree stipulates that its provisions shall apply to first, second and third-level workers' organizations and establishes a time-limit of  days for such organizations to amend their internal rules and elect their bodies in accordance with the prescribed standards, and that once this time-limit has elapsed legal personality will be granted only to those organizations whose representatives have been elected in accordance with its provisions. Finally, the complainant organization points out that the Supreme Court of Justice issued a precautionary measure which has temporarily suspended the implementation of the Decree. The complainant organization adds that the provisions in the Decree were adopted in an arbitrary manner by Paraguayan authorities, and that they attempt in a subtle way to divert the peoples' attention to paralyse those organizations which represent and defend workers' interests.
.Furthermore, the CLAT points out that the Government has suspended the process initiated for the adoption of the draft Labour Code, which was approved democratically and by common accord by all the sectors, and drafted with technical assistance from the ILO.
.In its communication of  June , the International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) states that Decree No. . establishing standards for the election of trade union leaders infringes the National Constitution and the international labour Conventions ratified by Paraguay, including Convention No. . More specifically, the IUF states that this Decree violates article  of the National Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of association, and section  of the Labour Code, which establishes that trade union organizations shall be entitled to draw up their own constitutions and administrative rules, to elect their bodies and representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and lawful activities.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government states that the complaint was made by a transnational organization which is not registered with the labour administration authorities. One of the most precious principles of international law is the right of peoples to self-determination, and thus interference in the internal affairs of a country which has established all the institutions for the defence of human rights is not only unjustified but raises a preliminary issue, and therefore the ILO should refrain from considering any kind of action in this particular case.
.The Government states that Decree No. . is the subject of an appeal before the Supreme Court of Justice, and that if this Court confirms the legality of the text and the requirement for trade union organizations to legitimize their bodies by means of a universal, secret and direct vote by their members, the ILO would be drawn into a matter which is not even remotely connected with freedom of association. It points out that the Labour Code in force empowers the labour administration authorities to supervise the application of the constitutions of trade unions and the legitimacy of persons claiming to represent them, as is categorically stated in the preamble of the Decree. At the same time, under the Constitution, the first standard which must be observed in determining the legality of legal texts is the National Constitution, which prescribes that all organizations, including trade unions, shall elect their leaders by direct, secret and universal vote of their members.
.In the light of the above, the labour administration authority has requested all occupational associations, within a very reasonable period of time which has not yet elapsed, to hold elections to bring their activities into line with the provisions of the Constitution. Since the effectiveness of any standard requires the establishment of penalties to be applied in the event that it is not observed, the labour administration authority has been authorized to revoke the legal personality of associations which fail to comply with this provision. The reason for this provision is easy to understand since many persons, claiming to be opponents or to be in exile have made it their business to swindle and embezzle the people under the guise of promoting trade unionism. For an elementary reason of moral probity, the labour administration authority cannot be a party to such anomalies, and thus it has been clearly established in the Decree that the present trade union leaders may during the course of the reorganization of their unions carry out acts for the administration and preservation of their assets, but under no circumstances may they dispose of such assets, which would be tantamount to the embezzlement of legitimately elected trade union leaders.
.First of all, in reply to the Government's statements concerning the non-admissibility of the present complaints, the Committee would like to point out that the complainant organizations have member trade union organizations in Paraguay, and thus the present complaints are totally admissible in accordance with the rules of procedure approved by the Governing Body.
.As regards the allegations concerning Decree No. . establishing standards for the election of trade union leaders, the Committee notes that according to the Government, the Decree in question is currently on appeal before the Supreme Court of Justice, that the promulgation of the Decree was intended to ensure that the trade union organizations could elect their leaders through a direct, secret and universal vote by their members, and that, inter alia, the objective of these measures was to put a stop to the numerous cases in which the promotion of trade unionism had been used as a cover for numerous cases of fraud. However, the Committee notes that the regulations contained in the Decree go well beyond these objectives.
.As regards the objective of ensuring that trade union organizations can elect their leaders through a direct, secret and universal vote by their members, the Committee considers that the imposition through an Act of this kind of vote does not raise any problems regarding the principles of freedom of association. However, the Committee regrets that Decree No. . should have been adopted arbitrarily and that the text, in violation of the provisions of Article  of Convention No.  (which establishes that workers' organizations shall have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules and to elect their representatives in full freedom), regulates in no less than  sections, and in an extremely detailed and meticulous manner, every aspect of the election of trade union officials. In addition, the Decree implies the cancellation of the legal personality of trade union organizations that do not conform to the provisions of the Decree, which is a serious violation of Convention No. .
.In these circumstances, the Committee points out to the Government that an excessively meticulous and detailed regulation of the trade union electoral process is an infringement of the right of such organizations to elect their representatives in full freedom, as established by Article  of Convention No. . The Committee therefore invites the Government to take the necessary measures to review the text of the above-mentioned Decree, in consultation with workers' organizations, with a view to guaranteeing the",0,1993,Paraguay
73,"independence of trade union organizations, and to repeal all provisions that imply an interference in the right of trade unions freely to elect their leaders, and in particular those provisions mentioned by the complainant organizations. The Committee accordingly requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal filed with the Supreme Court of Justice in this respect.
.As regards the allegation that the Government suspended the procedure under way for the adoption of the draft Labour Code, the Committee notes that during the discussions of the Committee on the Application of Standards at the th Session of the International Labour Conference, the Government stated that the Bill for the integrated reform of the Labour Code was in its final phase and being examined by the Chamber of Deputies, that it had been approved by the Senate and that discussion on the Bill had not been suspended but simply delayed. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this report.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to review Decree No. ., in consultation with workers' organizations, with a view to guaranteeing the independence of trade union organizations, and to repeal all the provisions which imply an interference in the right of workers' organizations freely to elect their leaders, and in particular the sections mentioned by the complainant organizations.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal filed with the Supreme Court of Justice in connection with this Decree.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of progress made in the adoption of the draft Labour Code.",1,1993,Paraguay
74,".The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting (see th Report, paras. , to ,, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), when it formulated interim conclusions. Subsequently, given the Government's failure to provide comments on the outstanding allegations, the Committee was obliged on two occasions to postpone the examination of this case. Likewise, at its November  meeting the Committee drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it would present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if it had not received the information or observations requested (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), para. ). The Government sent a communication dated  January .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) as well as the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee deeply regrets the Government's failure to comply with the Committee's procedure, and specifically regrets that the Government has failed to send the information requested concerning the outstanding allegations; owing to the time that has elapsed since the presentation of the complaints, the Committee has no choice but to examine the case without the Government's relevant observations. The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. If the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognize the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed replies to the allegations brought against them (see the Committee's First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.As regards the dismissal of four trade union leaders of the It Enramada Hotel Casino, allegedly owing to the establishment of a trade union, and the dismissal of trade unionists from the Industrial Aregu enterprise, the Committee notes with regret that the Government merely reiterates its previous reply to the effect that the pertinent appeals are now before the courts. The Committee deplores not having new observations from the Government concerning these dismissals, and once again reminds the Government that no person should be subject to dismissal or other prejudicial measures by reason of legitimate trade union activities, such as the establishment of a trade union, and that pursuant to Article  of Convention No. , workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. In these conditions, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the proceedings in the labour courts; it considers that the workers concerned should be reinstated in their jobs if it is established that their dismissals were due to legitimate trade union activities.
.As regards the imprisonment of the leaders of the Industrial Aregu enterprise trade union, Walter Villasboa and Ramn Ortega, allegedly owing to false accusations of sabotage, and given the Government's failure to provide observations, the Committee deeply regrets that these trade union leaders were deprived of their liberty for several weeks, without compelling evidence of their involvement in the crime. Noting that no charges were filed against these trade union leaders, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for legitimate trade union activities constitutes a serious violation of the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply regrets that, in spite of its numerous requests, the Government has failed to send additional information on the outstanding allegations, and urges it to keep it informed on the various issues in the present case.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the progress and outcome of proceedings in labour courts concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders and trade unionists from the It Enramada Hotel Casino and the Industrial Aregu enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to take necessary measure to ensure that these workers are reinstated in their jobs if it is established that they had been dismissed by reason of legitimate trade union activities.(c) In this connection, the Committee requests the Government to ensure compliance with the principle that no person should be subject to dismissal or other prejudicial measures for carrying out legitimate trade union activities such as the establishment of a trade union, and with Article  of Convention No. , which provides that workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment.(d) Lastly, the Committee deplores that trade union leaders Walter Villasboa and Ramn Ortega were deprived of their liberty for several weeks without sufficient evidence of their involvement in the crime they were accused of. The Committee requests the Government to refrain in the future from imprisoning trade union leaders and trade unionists for legitimate trade union activities, since this constitutes a serious violation of the principles of freedom of association.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) dated  June . This organisation presented new allegations in a communication dated  July . The Government replied in a communication dated  July .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) alleges that after almost a year of fruitless negotiations to conclude a new collective agreement in the Sant Jordi refrigeration enterprise, workers announced that they would hold a legal strike. The enterprise asked the Conciliation and Arbitration Board to postpone the strike while negotiations were resumed. The following day, instead of negotiating, the enterprise began to recruit replacement workers (which is prohibited during a strike). Naturally the workers reacted by going on strike. The Minister of Labour immediately declared the strike illegal and all the strikers were dismissed. An application has been made to the Labour Court against the decision of the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration holdinthat the employer was free to dismiss the strikers. The strike is continuing.
.Furthermore, the IUF alleges that although the Minister of Justice and Labour and the employer were informed immediately of the establishment of the Union of Workers of the It Enramada Hotel Casino, four of the trade union leaders were dismissed. Faced with this situation, the workers are now on strike to protest against the dismissal of the trade union officials, the delay in the payment of wages and the refusal of the employer to negotiate a collective agreement.
.Likewise, the IUF alleges that two leaders of the Industrial Aregu trade union, the secretary-general, Mr. Walter Villasboa, and the financial secretary, Mr. Ramn Ortega, were falsely accused of sabotage. What in fact they did was to disconnect an electricity cable which was overheating, something which occurs everyday in the factory. After several weeks in prison, they were released when it was impossible to substantiate the accusation of sabotage; however, they have been dismissed. The entire executive committee of the trade union and ten of its members were also dismissed. The workers have gone on strike; the employer, contrary to the provisions of the Labour Code, has not paid the wages outstanding for the period prior to the strike.
.Finally, in its communication dated  July , the IUF alleges that the Ministry of Justice and Labour and the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration, despite the requests made by the above-mentioned three trade unions, have not carried out investigations or sanctioned the employers concerned, and have not intervened in the respective collective disputes, where the strike still continues after three months.
.The Government states in its communication of  July  that in the early months of  an official of the Ministry of Justice and Labour mediated between the Sant Jordi refrigeration enterprise and the trade union in the negotiation of a collective agreement and that agreement was reached on all points under discussion with the exception of the wage increase (the trade union demanded a  per cent increase on the wage in force, whereas the enterprise offered an increase graded by seniority on the basis of  per cent). The Government adds that the strike in this enterprise was promoted and followed by only  of the  workers in the enterprise from  May  and that the trade union leader, Mr. Pedro Saledo, removed the negotiation process from its normal framework, i.e. within the Ministry of Justice and Labour, and took it to the parliamentary level. The labour dispute is currently being examined by the Permanent Board of Conciliation and Arbitration.
.As regards the dispute in the It Enramada Hotel Casino enterprise, the Government states",0,1992,Paraguay
75,"that in May  the Ministry of Justice and Labour carried out an inspection in the enterprise to settle matters concerning wages and social security problems and to clarify the situation of Messrs. Jorge Ovidio Snchez, Eladio Pereira, Andrs Fernndez and Salustiano Daz, who have filed applications with the Labour Court and are awaiting a judicial decision on the dispute in which they are implicated. In spite of this, tripartite meetings were convened to negotiate a settlement of the labour disputes. Once the administrative procedure had been exhausted, workers and employers, by common agreement, informed the Ministry that negotiations would be taken to Congress so that a peaceful settlement could be achieved on the matters of dispute in the worker/employer relationship.
.As regards the Industrial Aregu enterprise, the manager made a formal denunciation to the Ministry of Justice and Labour on  January  stating that a large number of workers of this enterprise had been working since  January below the minimum normal levels of production and were producing only the minimum quantities established in the collective agreement in force. However, in no case does this minimum level entitle workers to an additional bonus. According to the manager, the workers were hindered in carrying out their work by Messrs. Walter Villasboa, the secretary-general of the trade union, Pedro Cristaldo and Ignacio Torres, the secretaries responsible respectively for records and disputes.
.The Government adds that, on  January , the Aregu Industrial Union of Workers denounced the dismissal of workers and associates as being contrary to the provisions of the collective agreement. Although the Ministry convened tripartite meetings, the parties have not been able to settle their dispute.
.The Government adds that at an extraordinary meeting on  February , the trade union decided to call a strike against the alleged infringement of the collective agreement and that the Permanent Board of Conciliation and Arbitration intervened on  February , after being requested by the trade union to arbitrate the matters under dispute. On  June  the Board notified the workers on strike that they had  hours to return to their workplaces, and this decision was appealed by the trade union to the Board. Furthermore, the Industrial Aregu enterprise made an application to the Labour Court of the First Instance requesting justification for the dismissal against workers having special job stability. This is currently a matter for the judiciary since the Ministry of Justice and Labour is no longer competent in this respect.
.The Committee notes that this case refers to the dismissal of trade unionists in three enterprises and restrictions on the exercise on the right to strike.
.As regards the dismissal of workers of the Sant Jordi refrigeration enterprise because of a strike held by the trade union to obtain the signature of a new collective agreement, the Committee notes the statements of the Government and, in particular, that mediation by the Ministry of Justice and Labour has enabled the parties to reach agreement on all the issues, with the exception of the wage increase. The Committee notes that, according to the documentation sent by the Government, the dispute was submitted in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Labour Procedure to the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration, which notified the workers on strike that if they did not return to their workplaces they would be subject to dismissal. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the substitution by legislation of arbitration for the right to strike as a means of resolving labour disputes can only be justified in respect of essential services in the strict sense of the term (i.e. those services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, paras.  and ). The services provided by a refrigeration enterprise are not essential services in this sense of the term. The Committee would also recall that for a number of years the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has been making, in the same spirit, critical observations on sections  (submission of collective disputes to compulsory arbitration) and  of the Code of Labour Procedure (dismissal of workers who do not resume work when required to do so by the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration).
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to seek to ensure the reinstatement in their jobs of the workers of the Sant Jordi refrigeration enterprise who were dismissed during the strike. It expresses the hope that the above-mentioned principles concerning arbitration and compulsory arbitration will be duly taken into account in the forthcoming Labour Code, the draft text of which is currently before the Senate, and that the imposition of compulsory arbitration will be limited to cases of collective disputes in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, where an interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).
.As regards the alleged dismissal of four trade union leaders by the It Enramada Hotel Casino enterprise, as a result of the establishment of a trade union in the enterprise, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this matter was submitted to the Labour Court and that the various points of the dispute in the hotel will be dealt with in Congress (Parliament). The Committee emphasises that no one should be subject to dismissal or prejudicial measures as a result of exercising legitimate trade union activities, such as the establishment of a trade union, and that under Article  of Convention No. , workers should be given adequate protection against any act of discrimination which would restrict freedom of association in relation to their employment. The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in these matters before the Labour Court. The Committee also asks the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the trade union leaders Walter Villasboa and Rmon Ortega were falsely accused of sabotage and had to spend several weeks in prison before being freed, when it proved impossible to substantiate the accusation.
.Finally, as regards the dismissal of trade unionists in the Industrial Aregu enterprise, the Committee notes that this matter has been placed before the Labour Court of the First Instance. The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in and the outcome of the inquiry.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee asks the Government to seek to ensure the reinstatement in their jobs of the workers of the Sant Jordi refrigeration enterprise who were dismissed for continuing a strike when the collective dispute was submitted to compulsory arbitration. The Committee expresses the hope that the forthcoming Labour Code (the draft text of which is now before the Senate) will limit the imposition of compulsory arbitration to cases of collective disputes in essential services in the strict sense of the term (namely, those services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health as a whole or part of a population).(b) Furthermore, the Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of the development and outcome of the proceedings before the Labour Court concerning the dismissal of four officials of the Union of Workers of the It Enramada Hotel Casino. The Committee also asks the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the trade union leaders Walter Villasboa and Ramn Ortega were falsely accused of sabotage and had to spend several weeks in prison before being freed, when it proved impossible to substantiate the accusation.(c) The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in and the outcome of the proceedings in the Labour Court of the First Instance concerning the dismissal of trade unionists of the Industrial Aregu enterprise.",1,1992,Paraguay
76,".The complaint in this case appears in a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) dated  May .
.Since it had not received the Government's observations on the allegations, the Committee had to postpone its examination of this case on two occasions. At its meeting of May  the Committee drew the attention of the Government to the fact that in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it would present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the information or observations requested from the Government had not been received in due time (see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May )). To date, no information has been received from the Government.
.Paraguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) alleges that following a change in the ownership of the Carlos Casado SA enterprise,  workers were dismissed for having participated in a strike in , and that the above-mentioned enterprise infringed international labour Conventions and Recommendations concerning freedom of association and working conditions. Furthermore, the complainant states that in January  Mr. Eduardo Ojeda (Secretary-General of the CNT-Paraguay) was detained for three days, without any justification.
.The Committee observes that the complaint concerns the alleged dismissal of  workers from the Carlos Casado SA enterprise following their participation in a strike in  and the detention for three days of Mr. Eduardo Ojeda (Secretary-General of the CNT-Paraguay), without any justification. The Committee deeply deplores the lack of cooperation by the Government in the Committee's procedures, and in particular the fact that it has sent no information on the allegations made. Because of the time which has elapsed since the presentation of these complaints, the Committee is thus obliged to examine this case without being able to take into account the Government's observations on the allegations.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights both in law and in fact; thus the Committee is confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side must recognize the importance for the protection of their good name of formulating, for objective examination, detailed factual replies to the allegations made against them (see First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.As regards the alleged dismissal of  workers from the Carlos Casado SA enterprise as a result of their participation in a strike in , the Committee regrets that it has not received the observations of the Government on this allegation and reminds the Government that the use of extremely serious measures, such as dismissal of workers for having participated in a strike and refusal to re-employ them, implies a serious risk of abuse and constitutes a violation of freedom of association (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.As regards the alleged detention for three days of Mr. Eduardo Ojeda (Secretary-General of the CNT-Paraguay) without any justification, and in the absence of the Government's observations on this allegation, the Committee must deeply deplore that this trade union official was deprived of his freedom for three days without having been accused of any offence. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that the arrest - even if only briefly - of trade union leaders and trade unionists for exercising legitimate trade union activities constitutes a violation of the principles of freedom of association (see Digest, rd edition, , para. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)Deploring that the Government has not sent its observations on the dismissal of  workers from the Carlos Casado SA enterprise as a result of their participation in a strike in , the Committee reminds the Government that the use of extremely serious measures, such as dismissal of workers for having participated in a strike and refusal to re-employ them, implies a serious risk of abuse and constitutes a violation of freedom of association.(b)The Committee deeply deplores that Mr. Eduardo Ojeda (Secretary-General of the CNT-Paraguay) was detained for three days without having been accused of any offence, and in the absence of the Government's observations on this allegation, draws its attention to the principle that the arrest - even if only briefly - of trade union leaders and trade unionists for exercising legitimate trade union activities constitutes a violation of the principles of freedom of association.",0,1992,Paraguay
77,".The complaints were examined by the Committee at its meeting of May  without the observations by the Government, although the Committee had made an urgent appeal to the Government at its meeting of February  (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session).
.Subsequently the Government sent its observations in communications dated th May, st October and th November .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.First, the Committee regrets that the Government has not taken the measures which the Committee requested at its meeting of May  for the reinstatement of the four trade union officials, Messrs. Garca, Gehre, Salomn and Montanaro, who were dismissed by Lneas Areas Paraguayas. In these circumstances, and having concluded in its previous examination of the case that the matter concerned anti-trade union dismissals, in violation of Article  of Convention No. , the Committee once again urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the enterprise LAP reinstates immediately in their posts the four dismissed trade union officials.
.As regards the invalidation (currently being appealed on grounds of unconstitutionality before the Supreme Court of Justice) of the trade union status of the Paraguay Flight Attendants Association, the Committee points out to the Government that this invalidation, as well as the legislation in force, which denies public officials and employees the right to organise, are serious violations of the provisions of Convention No. , which establishes that workers, without distinction whatsoever (including public officials and employees), shall have the right to establish and to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation. The Committee thus regrets that the Government has not yet taken measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees public officials and employees the right to organise, despite the numerous recommendations made by the Committee in other cases (see th Report, Case No. , paras.  and ) and the repeated requests by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this effect. The Committee once again asks the Government as a matter of urgency to take the necessary measures to establish in its national legislation the right to organise of public officials and employees and expresses the hope that the Supreme Court of Justice, in its verdict on the trade union status of the APAV, will take full account of the obligations of Paraguay resulting from the ratification of Convention No. .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the court invalidation of the trade union status of the Paraguay Flight Attendants Association (APAV), the Committee emphasises that this is a very serious infringement of the right to organise and urges the Government to permit the free operation of APAV and to take the necessary measures for the establishment in legislation of the right of public officials and employees to organise. The Committee urges the Government to inform it of the results of the appeal on grounds of unconstitutionality lodged by the APAV following the refusal to recognise its trade union status.(b) As regards the dismissal of the four trade union officials, Messrs. Garca, Gehre, Salomn and Montanaro, from Lneas Areas Paraguayas, the Committee once again urges the Government to take the necessary measures for the immediate reinstatment of these officials in their jobs, and asks the Government to keep it informed on this matter.(c) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this case.
.The complaint in Case No.  was submitted by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in September  and was examined by the Committee at its meeting of May , when the Committee submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See nd Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).)
.The complaints in Case No.  were submitted by the Paraguay Flight Attendants' Association (APAV) ( July ), the International Flight Attendants' Association (IFAA) ( August ) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) ( September ). The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) supported the complaint submitted by the ICFTU in a communication of  October .
.At its February  meeting (see th Report, para. ), the Committee observed that, despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the complaints (Cases Nos.  and ), it had still not received the observations requested from the Government. The Committee thus drew the attention of the Government (as it had already done at its February  meeting in connection with Case No. ) to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee would examine the substance of the complaints at its next meeting even if the observations or information requested from the Government were not received in due time. In spite of this new urgent appeal, the Committee has still not received information from the Government on these two cases.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Once again, the Committee deeply deplores the Government's failure to cooperate with the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the fact that it has sent none of the information requested on numerous occasions, including urgent appeals, concerning Cases Nos.  and . Owing to the time elapsed since the allegations were submitted (between ten and  months) the Committee has been forced into examining these cases without the benefit of the Government's reply.
.The Committee emphasises that on the occasion of its first examination of Case No.  (May ), as well, it had no choice but to examine the case without the benefit of the Government's reply, and that in February  it examined three other cases concerning Paraguay (Nos. ,  and ) in the same circumstances.
.The Committee cannot accept this persistent attitude by the Government, especially in the light of the seriousness of the allegations contained in Cases Nos.  and , which refer to the arrest and dismissal of trade union leaders, the violent repression of a strike at the Itapu hydroelectric enterprise which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injured, the dismissal from several enterprises of  workers who were seeking to set up trade unions or to join them, and a number of other anti-union practices. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government in the future to send detailed replies to allegations without delay and cautions the Government that it reserves the right in the future to distribute and give the greatest publicity to its reports, as provided for in its procedural rules. (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, rd edition, , para. .)
.As regards Case No. , the Committee notes that the complainants refer to and present documents as supporting evidence of anti-union measures concerning the transfer and subsequent dismissal of Messrs. Antonio Garca, Ralf Gehre, Ren Salomn and Francisco Montanaro, leaders of the Paraguay Flight Attendants' Association (APAV), each of whom had more than  years of service in the Lneas Areas Paraguayas enterprise: () the transfers (November ) and dismissals (December ) occurred only a few months after the Association was given legal personality (August ); () these transfers affect four of the  leaders of the APAV (including its president and vice-president), to the exclusion of other workers, leaving the four at a distinct disadvantage inasmuch as they were compelled to leave their positions as flight supervisors to work at adminstrative tasks in the preparation of manuals and basic filing; () the Association had been denouncing the labour practices of the enterprise, which had requested the courts to annul the decision of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the Association as a trade union, on the grounds that flight attendants were civil servants and therefore not entitled to form a union; () according to the complainants, other members of the Association have also been pressured to resign from the union.
.The Committee concludes that the transfer and subsequent dismissal of the four above-mentioned trade union leaders violates Article  of Convention No. , according to which ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"". It emphasises the importance of providing remedies against such acts of anti-union discrimination and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that Lneas Areas Paraguayas will immediately reinstate the four dismissed trade union leaders.
.The Committee also emphasises that in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , workers' organisations (with the sole possible exception of civil servants engaged in the administration of the State referred to in Article  of Convention No. ), and thus flight attendants' organisations as well, should",0,1989,Paraguay
78,"have the right to regulate their conditions of employment through collective agreements with the employer or with an employers' organisation. The Committee thus requests the Government to take the measures necessary to guarantee the right of flight attendants' organisations to collective bargaining by means of collective agreements.
.As regards Case No. , the Committee reiterates the conclusions and recommendations which it formulated at its May  meeting (see the section above, entitled ""Previous examination of Case No. "").
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)The Committee once more deeply deplores the Government's total failure to cooperate with the Committee's procedure, and regrets that it has been obliged to examine the cases without the benefit of the Government's reply.(b)The Committee cannot accept the Government's persistent attitude, especially in the light of the seriousness of the allegations. The Committee therefore urges the Government in the future to send without delay detailed replies to allegations, and draws its attention to the fact that the Committee reserves the right to distribute and give wide publicity to its reports in accordance with its procedural rules.(c)As regards Case No. , the Committee considers that the transfers and subsequent dismissals of Messrs. Antonio Garca, Ralf Gehre, Ren Salomn and Francisco Montanaro (leaders of the Paraguay Flight Attendants' Association) violate Article  of Convention No. , and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that Lneas Areas Paraguayas will immediately reinstate these four trade union leaders, and to keep the Committee informed in this connection.(d)The Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to guarantee that flight attendants' organisations enjoy the right to bargain collectively by means of collective agreements.(e)As regards Case No. , the Committee reiterates the recommendations which it formulated at its May  meeting, which are as follows:- As regards the allegation that  workers in different branches of activity and enterprises, identified by name, have been dismissed for having sought to organise or join a trade union, the Committee emphasises the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers should have the right to set up and join trade unions, and that workers should benefit from adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures which may be necessary to remedy the situation, and to keep it informed in this connection.- As regards the allegations of the arrest of trade union leaders for legitimate trade union activities, the Committee recalls that preventive detention implies the risk of a serious interference in the activities of trade unions, and that it must be accompanied by appropriate judicial guarantees implemented within a reasonable period. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply detailed information on the current legal status of the following trade union leaders: Efigenio Lisboa, a peasant trade union leader, Clandelino Benitez, a leader of the ""Munich"" brewery trade union, Carlos Filizzola and Silvio Ferreira, CUT trade union leaders, and Pedro Salceco, a leader of the CAPSA, who are alleged to have been arrested or restricted in their freedom of movement.- As regards the allegations of the army's violent repression of a strike at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injuries on  December , the Committee urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry so as to clarify the facts, identify and punish the guilty parties, and prevent a repetition of such actions. It also requests to be kept informed of the results of any such inquiry.",-1,1989,Paraguay
79,".The Committee has examined Case No. , submitted by the International Union of Food and Allied Workers Associations (IUF) and the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), on two occasions and presented interim reports (see th and th Reports, paras. - and -, respectively, approved by the Governing Body at its th (May-June ) and th (November ) Sessions).
.As regards Case No. , submitted by the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP), the Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). Subsequently the WCOTP submitted new allegations in communications of  June and  September .
.The complaint in Case No.  was presented in a communication from the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), dated  November .
.At its meeting of November , the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government for its observations on Cases Nos. ,  and  (see th Report, para. ). Specifically, the Committee noted that, despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the complaints and the seriousness of the allegations contained therein, the Government had not transmitted the observations or information which had been requested. The Committee drew the attention of the Government to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of these cases at its next meeting, even if the observations requested from the Government had not been received in due time. Consequently, the Committee urged the Government to transmit its observations as soon as possible.
.The Committee has not received the observations and information which it had requested from the Government concerning these three cases.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations in this case concern the existence of two executive committees for the trade union of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. (Paraguay Cotton Company, CAPSA) (one of which, according to the complainant, was set up and is influenced and directed by the enterprise, and has been recognised by the Labour Directorate); the dismissal of several trade union leaders, including Pedro Salcedo; police interference in several meetings called by Mr. Salcedo and the declaration that a strike called by the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo was illegal. According to the Government, the Labour Directorate was awaiting a court decision regarding the legitimacy of one of the two executive committees, for the purpose of registering it. Nevertheless, the refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dated back to  and, according to the complainant, it was in that year that the Labour Directorate recognised the other executive committee. The Conciliation and Arbitration Board of the Ministry of Labour ordered the negotiation of a new collective agreement and specified that the other executive committee was to represent workers in the negotiations. More specifically, as concerns the strike that began during the harvest on  August  and was followed by  per cent of workers in the CAPSA enterprise, the complainant reports that the strike was suspended at the request of the enterprise on  September when the Conciliation and Arbitration Board declared the strike illegal.
.In its previous examination of this case, the Committee formulated the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):(b) The Committee requests the Government rapidly to inform it of the outcome of the current legal proceedings concerning the recognition of the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo, the reinstatement of dismissed union leaders, the refund of trade union contributions retained by the employer since  and the recognition of the other executive committee by the Labour Directorate. It recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that it has stated on numerous occasions that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to supply information and its observations on the application concerning the banning of the strike by workers in the CAPSA company, together with any information on developments in the labour dispute within this company.
.Previous examination of the case
.At its meeting of November , the Committee formulated the following recommendations concerning outstanding allegations (see th Report, para. ):(c) As regards the transfer and reclassification of the General Secretary of the OTEP, Mr. Juan Gabriel Espnola, and the dismissal of teachers Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma owing to their trade union activities, the Committee urges the Government once more to send its observations on these allegations, and in particular to state whether administrative resolution No.  concerning Mr. Espnola has been revoked or reviewed in the light of the written objections presented by Mr. Espnola before the Ministry of Education and Culture. It also requests the Government to inform the Committee of the reasons which led to the dismissal of trade unionists Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma.(d) The Committee deeply regrets the detention, psychological pressures and threats against trade unionist Cira Novara and her subsequent dismissal and requests the Government to inform it of the specific events and acts on which the charges are based, to state whether a judicial hearing has been instituted, and if so, to specify its outcome.
.Subsequent developments in the case
.Following the Committee's examination of this case in November , the WCOTP sent a communication dated  June  alleging that the ""National Teachers' Co-ordinating Committee"" (which brings together the Paraguyan teachers' organisations) called on teachers to strike throughout the nation on  July  in support of wage demands, in a context in which teachers are denied freedom of association and the right to engage in collective bargaining and to strike. In response, the Ministry of Education and Culture threatened to dismiss and disqualify teachers participating in such a strike, in violation of Convention No. . The text of the communication by the Ministry of Education and Culture was as follows:The Ministry of Education and Culture informs all teachers, heads of households and the population at large that, in response to the concerns expressed by the country's teachers, and in particular to their wish for an overall improvement in their conditions of life, as well as the progress of education in the country, it is working to reach such objectives through the appropriate legal channels.However, at the same time, it reminds the petitioners of the provisions contained in article  of the national Constitution, which states that: ""All Paraguyan citizens have the right to hold public office and employment with no conditions other than fitness for the position in question. Public officials and employees are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes, as well as from collectively leaving their posts."" Furthermore, article  states that: ""All residents are required to comply with and obey this Constitution and the laws, decrees, resolutions and other provisions which the public authorities may issue in accordance with their mandate.""Likewise, the Ministry recalls the provisions of Act No.  on the status of public officials, and in particular the following sections: ""Section : Public officials may not adopt collective resolutions against provisions issued by the competent authorities."" ""Section : Public officials are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes. For the purposes of this Act, a work stoppage is considered as a collective suspension of services, and a strike as a collective absence from work. Strikes shall also include the collective refusal of public officials, or individual refusals which take place within an interval of ten days by more than five officials in the same unit."" ""Section : Public officials who infringe the provisions of the foregoing section will be disqualified from holding public employment for a period of two to five years. Public officials who are found guilty of threatening work stoppages or strikes will be subject to dismissal."" ""Section : Public officials are prohibited from using the premises or property of the administration for any purpose other than the performance of their specific tasks.""Thus, given the rule of law, the Ministry warns those concerned that the above-mentioned sanctions and legal provisions will be applied in the event of any transgressions of said provisions.
.In its communication of  September  the WCOTP alleges that the Caaguaz regional branch of the Teachers' Organisation of Paraguay (OTEP) has been persecuted and harassed. The secretary of the Organisation, Hilda Montiel de Ros, has been suspended from the Francisco Solano Lpez School for having defended the OTEP before the school's students and teachers against accusations made by the school's director. In spite of the fact that these explanations were well received by the students and teachers, on  August ",-1,1989,Paraguay
80,"the school's director relieved this teacher of her functions accusing her of insubordination and rebellion, and requested the Ministry of Education and Culture to fill the vacancy. According to the allegations, this dismissal is unacceptable, inasmuch as the school's director has neither the authority nor the competence to act in this manner, since such procedures fall to the competence of the Ministry. According to the complainant, this case must be viewed against the background of administrative corruption, warnings and the suspensions of certain members of the OTEP. On  August  a delegation composed of teachers from the region, students, heads of households and the attorney for the Organisation's regional branch presented a formal complaint before the Ministry of Education. They were assured that a solution would be found to the problem of the teacher, Mrs. Hilda Montiel de Ros.
.The International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW) alleges in its communication of  November  that three members of the ""ONONDIVEPA"" National Peasants' Union, Messrs. Arcadio Flores, Jos Melgarejo and Aurelio Pereira had been detained without a warrant on  November  by members of the armed forces in Colonia Torybet, and that their current whereabouts are unknown.
.Moreover, IFPAAW alleges that on  November members of the third cavalry division in Curuguaty, Department of Canendiy, brutally beat a group of  peasants. On  November some  members of the army fired on a group of  peasants in Tava-I and Almeida, Guauauvi district, Department of San Pedro, and imprisoned most of them in the Curuguaty post. These are armed assaults on groups of peasants who have peacefully occupied uncultivated land in order to draw the Government's attention to the growing problems of over , peasants who still have no land, in spite of the Government's creation of the Rural Development Co-ordinating Committee.
.The Committee deeply deplores the fact that the Government has not sent any of the information requested by the Committee and that, owing to the time elapsed, the Committee has been forced to examine the cases without the benefit of the Government's replies to the allegations in question. The Committee must recall the considerations presented in its First Report (para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ), which it has had to repeat on several occasions: the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, as the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be brought against them.
.Given the seriousness of the allegations in these cases which concern, inter alia, the detention of trade unionists, various acts of anti-union discrimination and serious legal restrictions on the trade union rights of public officials and employees, the Committee deplores the Government's absence of co-operation with the Committee's procedures. The Committee urges the Government in the future to send detailed replies to allegations without delay.
.As regards Case No. , the Committee reiterates the conclusions which it formulated at its November  meeting, namely, that the lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the recognition of the executive committee of the trade union of Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. and the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by that enterprise constitute a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned. Bearing in mind that the authorities' refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dates back to , the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to ensuring that legislation will facilitate the expeditious disposition of proceedings involving labour-related matters. Moreover, since the Government has provided no information concerning the declaration of illegality of the strike which, according to the complainants, was followed by  per cent of the workers of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. enterprise, the Committee again emphasises that the right to strike constitutes an essential means for workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests, and that limitations on, or the prohibition of strikes may only apply in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (those where an interruption could endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). It considers that this definition does not cover this present case.
.As regards Case No. , the Committee emphasises that the complainant organisation has alleged that teachers were dismissed or otherwise persecuted owing to their trade union activities. Consequently, given the Government's failure to reply, the Committee draws its attention to Article  of Convention No. , which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"", and emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.In addition, the Committee deplores that the Ministry of Education and Culture reacted to the call for a national strike on  July  by the National Teachers' Co-ordinating Body to obtain wage increases, by threatening dismissals and disqualifications. In general, on the question of restrictions which may be imposed by legislation on the trade union rights of teachers who are also public officials, the Committee emphasises that workers in the education sector should enjoy the right to establish trade union organisations, to bargain collectively and to resort to strikes (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), paras.  and ; see also the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , paras. ,  and ). The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees these rights to workers in the education sector.
.Lastly, as regards Case No.  concerning the detention and violent assaults by the armed forces on groups of peasants who, according to allegations, were peacefully occupying uncultivated lands, and concerning the detention, without warrant, of Messrs. Arcadio Flores, Jos Melgarejo and Aurelio Pereira, members of the National Peasants' Union, the Committee regrets this climate of violence. It requests the Government to confirm whether Messrs. Flores, Melgarejo and Pereira have been released and requests all parties involved to seek to resolve peacefully disputes arising from agrarian reform and rural development.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deplores the fact that since November  the Government has failed to provide any of the information requested in these three cases. The Committee deplores the Government's lack of co-operation and urges it in the future to submit detailed replies without delay.(b) As regards the proceedings for the recognition of the executive committee of the trade union of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. (Paraguay Cotton Company), and the reinstatement of trade union leaders dismissed since , the Committee again emphasises that the absence of a court ruling over such a long period of time constitutes a denial of justice, and therefore a denial of trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the legislation will facilitate labour-related judicial proceedings.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that workers in cotton companies do not provide an essential service in the strict sense of the term, and consequently that their right to strike should not be subject to serious restrictions or prohibitions, either in law or in practice.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees to workers in the education sector the right to establish trade unions, to bargain collectively and to strike.(e) The Committee draws the Government's attention to Article  of Convention No. , which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"". It emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination and requests the Government to take measures for the reinstatement of the teacher trade unionist, Mrs. Montiel de Ros.(f) Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the trade unionists of the National Peasants' Union, Messrs. Flores, Melgarejo and Pereira have been released, and requests all parties involved to seek to resolve peacefully problems which may arise from agrarian reform and rural development.",-1,1989,Paraguay
81,".The complaint in Case No.  was presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in September  and was examined by the Committee at its May  meeting (see nd Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )) and at its May  meeting (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )).
.Subsequently, the Government has sent its observations in communications dated  May and  October .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At the May  meeting of the Committee, three allegations presented by the ICFTU in communications of  September,  October and  December  were still pending. According to the ICFTU, since the new Government came to power,  workers in different branches of activity and enterprises have been dismissed for having sought to organise or join trade unions (see nd Report, para.  for full list of enterprises involved). Information was also provided on the illegal detention of the following trade union leaders: Lisboa, Bentez, Ferreira, Filizzola and Salcedo. Finally, the complainant organisation alleged that the army had resorted to violent repression during the strike at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injuries on  December .
.At its May  meeting, given the Government's failure to provide observations, despite urgent requests to do so, made at its February  meeting, the Committee had to reiterate the recommendations formulated at its May  meeting, which were as follows:- As regards the allegation that  workers in different branches of activity and enterprises, identified by name, have been dismissed for having sought to organise or join a trade union, the Committee emphasises the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers should have the right to establish and join trade unions, and that workers should benefit from adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures which may be necessary to remedy the situation and to keep it informed in this connection.- As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders for legitimate trade union activities, the Committee recalls that preventive detention implies the risk of a serious interference in the activities of trade unions, and that it must be accompanied by appropriate judicial guarantees implemented within a reasonable period. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply detailed information on the current legal status of the following trade union leaders: Efigenio Lisboa, a peasant trade union leader, Claudelino Bentez, a leader of the ""Munich"" Brewery trade union, Carlos Filizzola and Silvio Ferreira, CUT trade union leaders, and Pedro Salcedo, a leader of the CAPSA, who are alleged to have been arrested or restricted in their freedom of movement.- As regards the allegations of the army's violent repression of the strike at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injuries on  December , the Committee urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry so as to clarify the facts, identify and punish the guilty parties, and prevent a repetition of such actions. It also asks to be kept informed of the results of any such inquiry.
.As regards the incident during the strike at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, the Government states that in the light of the events, a judicial inquiry has been set up to throw light on the facts of the matter, determine responsibility, punish the guilty parties and prevent the recurrence of such actions.
.The Government notes that most of the alleged incidents took place under the previous, and not the present, Government. Nevertheless, the allegations made by the trade unions in the past are being heeded by the competent authorities.
.As regards the alleged detentions, the Government declares that no trade union leaders are presently detained. With regard to the case of Efigenio Lisboa, it states that in  he was detained and accused of a criminal act under the ordinary law, and that the trial is still under way.
.The Government points out, in a communication dated  May , that the guarantee of job security for workers who occupy trade union posts is provided for in Act No.  of  December , according to which the compulsory reinstatement of dismissed leaders falls within the competence of the judiciary. Cases of dismissal, for whatever reason, are outside the competence of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, although it does make every effort to ensure that labour laws are respected.
.The Committee welcomes the fact that the Government has now transmitted its reply concerning this case. The Committee notes that according to the Government's reply, the trade union leaders Filizzola, Ferreira, Salcedo and Bentez were detained under the previous Government and that they have now been freed, and that Mr. Lisboa is on trial, charged with a criminal act under the ordinary law. The Committee also notes that a judicial inquiry has begun into the injuries and deaths which occurred during the army's violent repression of the strike on  December  at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, and urges the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation.
.The Committee observes that, with regard to the alleged dismissal of  workers prior to September , all of whom were employed in different branches of activity and enterprises where they sought to organise or join a trade union, the Government confines itself, in its reply, to showing that cases of dismissals are outside the competence of the Ministry of Justice and Labour and that the workers may take legal action in order to be reinstated, without actually providing specific information on the alleged anti-union dismissals, as requested by the Committee in May  and . Thus, the Committee points out to the Government that the dismissal of workers on grounds of membership of an organisation or trade union activities violates the principles of freedom of association; it reiterates that workers must be provided with adequate protection against anti-union discrimination. The Committee also recalls that it is the responsibility of the competent authorities, and particularly the Government, to ensure that these principles are applied.
.In addition, given that in its statements denying the allegations, the Government maintains that the examination of cases of dismissal lies solely within the competence of the judicial authorities and not the administrative authorities dealing with labour issues, the Committee recalls that at its February  meeting, when examining another complaint against the Government of Paraguay (Case No. ) concerning alleged anti-union dismissals and the subsequent proceedings which dragged on for more than three years, it pointed out that ""the absence of a court ruling over such a long period of time constitutes a denial of justice, and therefore a denial of trade union rights"" (see th Report, para. ). The Committee has also noted the slowness of judicial proceedings in other cases relating to anti-union dismissals (see, for example, st Report, Case No. , para. , where judicial proceedings lasted four years). Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that, where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that workers who have been dismissed for trade union activities are reinstated in their jobs, and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the alleged deaths and injuries during the army's violent repression of the strike on  December  at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, the Committee urges the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial inquiry that is under way.(b) As regards the numerous anti-union dismissals which, according to the complainants, took place prior to September , the Committee, regretting that the Government has not sent specific information in spite of requests to do so at its May  and May  meetings, wishes to bring to the attention of the Government the fact that the dismissal of workers for membership of an organisation or union activities is a violation of the principles of freedom of association, and reiterates that workers should enjoy adequate protection against anti-union discrimination; the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that workers who have been dismissed for trade union activities are reinstated in their jobs and requests it to keep it informed of developments in this respect.(c) In view of the slowness of judicial proceedings in cases of dismissals based on alleged anti-union discrimination, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that, where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities responsible for labour issues immediately",0,1989,Paraguay
82,"institute an inquiry and take all necessary measures to remedy the effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention.
.The complaint in Case No.  was submitted by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in September  and was examined by the Committee at its meeting of May , when the Committee submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See nd Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).)
.The complaints in Case No.  were submitted by the Paraguay Flight Attendants' Association (APAV) ( July ), the International Flight Attendants' Association (IFAA) ( August ) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) ( September ). The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) supported the complaint submitted by the ICFTU in a communication of  October .
.At its February  meeting (see th Report, para. ), the Committee observed that, despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the complaints (Cases Nos.  and ), it had still not received the observations requested from the Government. The Committee thus drew the attention of the Government (as it had already done at its February  meeting in connection with Case No. ) to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee would examine the substance of the complaints at its next meeting even if the observations or information requested from the Government were not received in due time. In spite of this new urgent appeal, the Committee has still not received information from the Government on these two cases.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Once again, the Committee deeply deplores the Government's failure to cooperate with the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the fact that it has sent none of the information requested on numerous occasions, including urgent appeals, concerning Cases Nos.  and . Owing to the time elapsed since the allegations were submitted (between ten and  months) the Committee has been forced into examining these cases without the benefit of the Government's reply.
.The Committee emphasises that on the occasion of its first examination of Case No.  (May ), as well, it had no choice but to examine the case without the benefit of the Government's reply, and that in February  it examined three other cases concerning Paraguay (Nos. ,  and ) in the same circumstances.
.The Committee cannot accept this persistent attitude by the Government, especially in the light of the seriousness of the allegations contained in Cases Nos.  and , which refer to the arrest and dismissal of trade union leaders, the violent repression of a strike at the Itapu hydroelectric enterprise which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injured, the dismissal from several enterprises of  workers who were seeking to set up trade unions or to join them, and a number of other anti-union practices. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government in the future to send detailed replies to allegations without delay and cautions the Government that it reserves the right in the future to distribute and give the greatest publicity to its reports, as provided for in its procedural rules. (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, rd edition, , para. .)
.As regards Case No. , the Committee notes that the complainants refer to and present documents as supporting evidence of anti-union measures concerning the transfer and subsequent dismissal of Messrs. Antonio Garca, Ralf Gehre, Ren Salomn and Francisco Montanaro, leaders of the Paraguay Flight Attendants' Association (APAV), each of whom had more than  years of service in the Lneas Areas Paraguayas enterprise: () the transfers (November ) and dismissals (December ) occurred only a few months after the Association was given legal personality (August ); () these transfers affect four of the  leaders of the APAV (including its president and vice-president), to the exclusion of other workers, leaving the four at a distinct disadvantage inasmuch as they were compelled to leave their positions as flight supervisors to work at adminstrative tasks in the preparation of manuals and basic filing; () the Association had been denouncing the labour practices of the enterprise, which had requested the courts to annul the decision of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the Association as a trade union, on the grounds that flight attendants were civil servants and therefore not entitled to form a union; () according to the complainants, other members of the Association have also been pressured to resign from the union.
.The Committee concludes that the transfer and subsequent dismissal of the four above-mentioned trade union leaders violates Article  of Convention No. , according to which ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"". It emphasises the importance of providing remedies against such acts of anti-union discrimination and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that Lneas Areas Paraguayas will immediately reinstate the four dismissed trade union leaders.
.The Committee also emphasises that in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , workers' organisations (with the sole possible exception of civil servants engaged in the administration of the State referred to in Article  of Convention No. ), and thus flight attendants' organisations as well, should have the right to regulate their conditions of employment through collective agreements with the employer or with an employers' organisation. The Committee thus requests the Government to take the measures necessary to guarantee the right of flight attendants' organisations to collective bargaining by means of collective agreements.
.As regards Case No. , the Committee reiterates the conclusions and recommendations which it formulated at its May  meeting (see the section above, entitled ""Previous examination of Case No. "").
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)The Committee once more deeply deplores the Government's total failure to cooperate with the Committee's procedure, and regrets that it has been obliged to examine the cases without the benefit of the Government's reply.(b)The Committee cannot accept the Government's persistent attitude, especially in the light of the seriousness of the allegations. The Committee therefore urges the Government in the future to send without delay detailed replies to allegations, and draws its attention to the fact that the Committee reserves the right to distribute and give wide publicity to its reports in accordance with its procedural rules.(c)As regards Case No. , the Committee considers that the transfers and subsequent dismissals of Messrs. Antonio Garca, Ralf Gehre, Ren Salomn and Francisco Montanaro (leaders of the Paraguay Flight Attendants' Association) violate Article  of Convention No. , and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that Lneas Areas Paraguayas will immediately reinstate these four trade union leaders, and to keep the Committee informed in this connection.(d)The Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to guarantee that flight attendants' organisations enjoy the right to bargain collectively by means of collective agreements.(e)As regards Case No. , the Committee reiterates the recommendations which it formulated at its May  meeting, which are as follows:- As regards the allegation that  workers in different branches of activity and enterprises, identified by name, have been dismissed for having sought to organise or join a trade union, the Committee emphasises the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers should have the right to set up and join trade unions, and that workers should benefit from adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures which may be necessary to remedy the situation, and to keep it informed in this connection.- As regards the allegations of the arrest of trade union leaders for legitimate trade union activities, the Committee recalls that preventive detention implies the risk of a serious interference in the activities of trade unions, and that it must be accompanied by appropriate judicial guarantees implemented within a reasonable period. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply detailed information on the current legal status of the following trade union leaders: Efigenio Lisboa, a peasant trade union leader, Clandelino Benitez, a leader of the ""Munich"" brewery trade union, Carlos Filizzola and Silvio Ferreira, CUT trade union leaders, and Pedro Salceco, a leader of the CAPSA, who are alleged to have been arrested or restricted in their freedom of movement.- As regards the allegations of the army's violent repression of a strike at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injuries on  December , the Committee urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry so as to clarify the facts, identify and punish the guilty parties, and prevent a repetition of such actions. It also requests to be kept informed of the results of any",0,1989,Paraguay
83,"such inquiry.
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint alleging violation of freedom of association against the Government of Paraguay in a communication of  September . It subsequently sent new allegations in communications of  October and  December . Since then, the Government has not furnished any information or observations concerning this complaint.
.At its meeting of February , the Committee, having noted that it had not received observations from the Government in spite of the time elapsed since the complaint was received, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, pursuant to the procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, it would proceed to examine the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the Government's observations were not received in time.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU states that in spite of the optimism to which the inauguration of the new democratic Government had given rise as regards trade union rights and freedoms, acts of anti-union discrimination continue. It specified that these acts affect trade union members and large groups of workers who endeavour to organise or to join a trade union.
.Since the new Government came to power,  workers have been dismissed for having sought to organise or join a trade union, and the ICFTU furnishes the following breakdown:Trade unions and enterprises Number of dismissalsWorkers in the clothing and allied branches,  Employees and workers in trade,  Terminal (city of Este),  Parawood (city of Este),  Food,  Guarani Galleries (in Este),  Transport,  Vargas Pena undertaking,  Heisecke,  La Vencedora,  Polifabril,  Santa Teresa Ceramics,  Box du Paraguay Carton,  Franco Spezzini,  Incol,  Techno Electrics,  Construction,  Barrial Hermanos,  Adolfo Dominguez,  SGCL undertaking, 
.The ICFTU states that the Workers' Unified Confederation (CUT) has explained that these dismissals aimed at repressing workers who exercised their legitimate rights to organise within enterprises, and who sought, through these organisations, to assert their rights and claims. These workers have, in vain, requested to be reinstated. What is more, according to their attorneys,  per cent of them are unable to find new jobs because of the circulation of blacklists among companies.
.Moreover, the ICFTU mentions the illegal detention of two trade union leaders, Efigenio Lisboa and Clandelino Benitez, who played an important role in a strike or labour dispute.
.The former was arrested by the armed forces for having sided with landless peasants on  June  in the city of Este. He was imprisoned at the ""Escorte presidential battalion barracks"", held incommunicado and prevented from consulting an attorney. He was released after  days, but does not enjoy full freedom of movement. The latter, who is general secretary of the ""Munich"" brewery trade union, was also illegally arrested by the police, acting without a warrant, on  August  while travelling to work on a bus.
.Lastly, the owner of the Asuncin brewery and senator of the Colorado Party, Blas Riquelme, and the INDEGA and CAPSA enterprises dismissed the leaders of trade unions which had recently been established in these enterprises. Moreover, the latter of these enterprises refused to negotiate a collective agreement with the workers.
.In another communication of  October , the ICFTU denounces the arrest of trade unionists Carlos Filizzola and Silvio Ferreira, leaders of the CUT, Pedro Salcedo, General Secretary of the CAPSA trade union, on  October , while they were presenting a petition to the President of the Republic, and the violent repression in the Asuncin police station, on  October , of trade union leaders who were demanding the release of their comrades.
.Lastly, on  December , the ICFTU states that its regional affiliate, the Workers' Inter-American Regional Organisation (ORIT) reported that on  December , at  p.m., a strike by the workers of the Itapu (Paraguay) hydroelectric scheme was violently repressed by the Paraguayan army. This action resulted in two deaths and dozens of injuries. Moreover, according to the ICFTU, although the striking workers were not affiliated with the CUT, this organisation called on its affiliate trade unions in Itapu to join the strike movement, which led to a general strike on the company's site. The CUT also decided to call a symbolic protest strike of all of its affiliate trade unions throughout the country over the following days.
.The Committee notes with deep regret that, in spite of the time elapsed since the complaint was filed, and despite repeated requests to the Government for its comments and observations on this case, the Government has not replied to the allegations of the complainant Confederation.
.In these circumstances, and in accordance with the corresponding rule of procedure (see para.  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee finds itself obliged to present a report on the substance of the matter, even in the absence of information requested from the Government.
.In the first place, the Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure set up in the ILO for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote the respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. If the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for their own reputation of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them. (See the Committee's First Report, para. .)
.The Committee notes that the allegations in this matter concern: () the dismissal of  workers for seeking to organise or join a trade union; () the refusal of an enterprise to negotiate a collective agreement with its workers; () the illegal detention of several trade union leaders for having called a strike, participated in a labour dispute, or exercised their right to demonstrate; and () the violent repression by the army of a strike at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and dozens of injuries.
.As regards the allegation of the dismissal of  workers, identified by name, from several enterprises for having sought to organise or join a trade union, the Committee recalls that in ratifying Conventions Nos.  and , the Government undertook to () guarantee the right of workers to set up and join trade unions, and () take measures to protect workers against actions, including dismissal, which entail discrimination based on trade union reasons.
.Consequently, the Committee recalls that the Government is responsible for preventing all acts of anti-union discrimination, and that it must ensure that complaints of anti-union discrimination are examined in the framework of national procedures which should be prompt, impartial and considered as such by the parties concerned. Moreover, the Committee recalls that the practice of blacklisting workers seriously undermines the exercise of trade union rights.
.As regards the allegation that an enterprise refused to negotiate a collective agreement with its workers, the Committee notes that, in ratifying Convention No. , the Government undertook to adopt appropriate measures to promote the development of voluntary collective bargaining procedures between employers and organisations of employers and organisations of workers, as a means of regulating conditions of employment. The Committee also recalls the importance which it attaches to the principle that employers should, for the purposes of collective bargaining, recognise the representative organisations of their employees.
.As regards the allegations that several trade union leaders, identified by name, have been arrested for having exercised legitimate trade union activities, the Committee notes that, according to the statements made by the ICFTU, these trade union leaders, while legitimately exercising their right to strike or demonstrate, were illegally arrested, that although some have been released, they remain subject to restrictions, and that they have not been brought to trial. The Committee has always considered that workers should enjoy the right to strike and the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests. It also emphasises that the preventive detention of trade unionists implies serious interference in trade union activities and should be accompanied by appropriate judicial safeguards which are implemented within a reasonable period.
.As regards the allegations of the violent repression by the army of a strike at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and dozens of injuries on  December , the Committee recalls that a climate of violence, such as that reflected by the violent death or injury of trade unionists, constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of freedom of association. On many occasions, when events have led to the loss of life or serious injury, the Committee has emphasised the importance of instituting independent judicial inquiries to determine the facts, identify and punish the guilty parties, and prevent the repetition of such actions.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply regrets the fact",0,1989,Paraguay
84,"that the Government has not supplied its comments or observations on the serious allegations in this matter.(b) As regards the allegation that  workers in different branches of activity and enterprises, identified by name, have been dismissed for having sought to organise or join a trade union, the Committee emphasises the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers should have the right to set up and join trade unions, and that workers should benefit from adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures which may be necessary to remedy the situation, and to keep it informed in this connection.(c) As regards the allegation that an enterprise refused to negotiate a collective agreement with its workers, the Committee recalls that in ratifying Convention No. , the Government undertook to adopt appropriate measures to promote collective bargaining. It emphasises that employers should, within the framework of collective bargaining, recognise the representative organisations of the workers they employ.(d) As regards the allegations of the arrest of trade union leaders for legitimate trade union activities, the Committee recalls that preventive detention implies the risk of a serious interference in the activities of trade unions, and that it must be accompanied by appropriate judicial guarantees implemented within a reasonable period. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply detailed information on the current legal status of the following trade union leaders: Efigenio Lisboa, a peasant trade union leader, Clandelino Benitez, a leader of the ""Munich"" brewery trade union, Carlos Filizzola and Silvio Ferreira, CUT trade union leaders, and Pedro Salceco, a leader of the CAPSA, who are alleged to have been arrested or restricted in their freedom of movement.(e) As regards the allegations of the army's violent repression of a strike at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injuries on  December , the Committee urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry so as to clarify the facts, identify and punish the guilty parties, and prevent a repetition of such actions. It also requests to be kept informed of the results of any such inquiry.",1,1989,Paraguay
85,".The complaint was submitted by the Trade Union of Employees and Workers in Commerce (SEOC) and the Workers' Trade Union Movement (MIT) in two communications dated  November  and  January  respectively. The Government furnished its observations on  January and  March . The Government sent a further communication on  September .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Assocation and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding in this case since its last examination, in May  (see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session), refer to the refusal by the Ministry of Justice and Labour to grant members of the executive committee of the SEOC credentials enabling them to undertake trade union functions vis--vis the employers in labour disputes, and to the refusal of the Labour Directorate to acknowledge and register the application concerning the amendment of the by-laws of the SEOC. They also refer to the dismissal, for reasons related to trade union activities, of Mr. Milcades Paredes, leader of the National Union of Workers in the Metal and Allied Trades (SINOMA) in December , and of trade unionists Gilberto Melo Garca, Jos Garcete, Gilberto Moreno, Victoriano Fleitas, Oscar Gmez, Alcades Soria and Vicente Segovia.
.The Committee, at its meeting in May , invited the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to promote the necessary procedures to obtain the reinstatement of the eight trade unionists dismissed by the Transporte Fnix S.A. enterprise, and emphasises that in accordance with Article  of Convention No. : ""Workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment.""(b) The Committee requests the Government to provide quickly information on the allegations presented by the Trade Union of Employees and Workers in Commerce.
.In a communication dated  September  the Government states that in accordance with resolution No. , issued on  March  by the Labour Directorate, the Trade Union of Employees and Workers in Commerce (SEOC) was duly registered and has full freedom as regards its union activities.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Milcades Paredes, leader of the National Union of Workers in the Metal and Allied Trades (SINOMA) and other workers, the Government states that cases of dismissal, on whatever grounds, do not come within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and Labour. The compulsory reinstatement of the dismissed union leader is a matter for the judicial authorities, in accordance with section  of Act No. /. Nevertheless, it is the policy of the Ministry of Labour to act as an intermediary in disputes of this kind entailing a certain degree of gravity. The Government adds that the case relating to the dismissal of Mr. Paredes, entitled ""Milcades Paredes and others versus Fnix S.A., No.  Public Transport Route: reinstatement"", is at the stage of producing evidence before the Labour Court of First Instance (Second Session), secretariat No. . It adds that as soon as the decision is handed down a copy will be forwarded.
.The Government concludes by reaffirming that the new Government has an attitude of total respect towards freedom of association. Proof of this can be seen in the increasing number of new trade unions registered with the Labour Directorate, especially within the last four months (the Government attaches figures concerning the  trade unions that have been recognised by the Labour Directorate since  March  and lists the  trade union organisations which, according to the register, were active on  February ).
.As regards the allegation concerning the refusal to grant credentials enabling the executive of the SEOC to carry out trade union functions, the Committee, while noting the Government's information that the said union was registered on  March  and is now totally free to carry out its trade union activities, cannot but recall that the conditions for registering a trade union should not amount to the requirement of prior authorisation by the authorities for a trade union to be set up or to function.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Milcades Paredes, leader of the National Union of Workers in the Metal and Allied Trades, and of trade unionists Gilberto Melo Garca, Jos Garcete, Gilberto Moreno, Victoriano Fleitas, Oscar Gmez, Alcades Soria and Vicente Segovia, the Committee notes the Government's information that the application for reinstatement of these persons is now at the stage of producing evidence. In this connection, the Committee wishes to inform the Government that the existence of basic legislative provisions prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination is not sufficient unless these provisions are accompanied by effective procedures ensuring their application in practice. Thus, for example, it may often be difficult - if not impossible - for a worker to furnish proof of an act of anti-union discrimination of which he has been the victim. This shows the full importance of Article  of Convention No. , which provides that machinery appropriate to national conditions shall be established, where necessary, to ensure respect for the right to organise. This means that besides preventive machinery to forestall anti-union dismissals (such as, for example, the obtaining of prior authorisation from the labour inspectorate before carrying out the dismissal of a trade union leader), a further means of ensuring effective protection could be to make it compulsory for employers to prove that the motive for their decision to dismiss a worker has no connection with the latter's trade union activities. (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, third edition, , paras.  and .)
.The Committee can only request the Government to strengthen the machinery to enable trade unionists dismissed on account of their trade union activity to obtain reinstatement.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to strengthen the machinery to enable trade unionists dismissed on account of their trade union activity to obtain reinstatement.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation concerning: Milcades Paredes, Gilberto Melo Garca, Jos Garcete, Gilberto Moreno, Victoriano Fleitas, Oscar Gmez, Alcades Soria and Vicente Segovia.
.The complaint appears in communications from the Trade Union ofEmployees and Workers in Commerce and the Workers' Trade Union Movement (MIT)dated  November  and  January , respectively. The Governmentreplied in communications of  January and  March .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of theRight to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise andCollective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In general, the Committee must regret that the Government has notreplied in greater detail to the allegations in this case.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Milcades Paredes, a trade union leaderof the National Metal and Allied Workers' Trade Union, and that of sevenmembers of that trade union for demanding payment of the Christmas bonus fromthe owner of the Transporte Fenix S.A. enterprise (covering the No.  routeof the public transport system), the Committee observes that the Governmenthas merely sent a copy of Act No.  of  December  (concerningprotection of trade union leaders), and stated that the reinstatement ofworkers holding trade union office falls under the competence of the courts.Since the Government has not denied that the dismissals in question were dueto trade union activities as alleged by the complainant organisation, theCommittee requests the Government to promote necessary procedures to obtainthe reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists, and emphasises that inaccordance with Article  of Convention No. , ""Workers shall enjoy adequateprotection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of theiremployment.""
.The Committee requests the Government to quickly provide information onthe allegations presented by the Trade Union of Employees and Workers inCommerce.

86,".The Committee has examined Case No. , submitted by the International Union of Food and Allied Workers Associations (IUF) and the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), on two occasions and presented interim reports (see th and th Reports, paras. - and -, respectively, approved by the Governing Body at its th (May-June ) and th (November ) Sessions).
.As regards Case No. , submitted by the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP), the Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). Subsequently the WCOTP submitted new allegations in communications of  June and  September .
.The complaint in Case No.  was presented in a communication from the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), dated  November .
.At its meeting of November , the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government for its observations on Cases Nos. ,  and  (see th Report, para. ). Specifically, the Committee noted that, despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the complaints and the seriousness of the allegations contained therein, the Government had not transmitted the observations or information which had been requested. The Committee drew the attention of the Government to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of these cases at its next meeting, even if the observations requested from the Government had not been received in due time. Consequently, the Committee urged the Government to transmit its observations as soon as possible.
.The Committee has not received the observations and information which it had requested from the Government concerning these three cases.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations in this case concern the existence of two executive committees for the trade union of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. (Paraguay Cotton Company, CAPSA) (one of which, according to the complainant, was set up and is influenced and directed by the enterprise, and has been recognised by the Labour Directorate); the dismissal of several trade union leaders, including Pedro Salcedo; police interference in several meetings called by Mr. Salcedo and the declaration that a strike called by the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo was illegal. According to the Government, the Labour Directorate was awaiting a court decision regarding the legitimacy of one of the two executive committees, for the purpose of registering it. Nevertheless, the refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dated back to  and, according to the complainant, it was in that year that the Labour Directorate recognised the other executive committee. The Conciliation and Arbitration Board of the Ministry of Labour ordered the negotiation of a new collective agreement and specified that the other executive committee was to represent workers in the negotiations. More specifically, as concerns the strike that began during the harvest on  August  and was followed by  per cent of workers in the CAPSA enterprise, the complainant reports that the strike was suspended at the request of the enterprise on  September when the Conciliation and Arbitration Board declared the strike illegal.
.In its previous examination of this case, the Committee formulated the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):(b) The Committee requests the Government rapidly to inform it of the outcome of the current legal proceedings concerning the recognition of the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo, the reinstatement of dismissed union leaders, the refund of trade union contributions retained by the employer since  and the recognition of the other executive committee by the Labour Directorate. It recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that it has stated on numerous occasions that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to supply information and its observations on the application concerning the banning of the strike by workers in the CAPSA company, together with any information on developments in the labour dispute within this company.
.Previous examination of the case
.At its meeting of November , the Committee formulated the following recommendations concerning outstanding allegations (see th Report, para. ):(c) As regards the transfer and reclassification of the General Secretary of the OTEP, Mr. Juan Gabriel Espnola, and the dismissal of teachers Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma owing to their trade union activities, the Committee urges the Government once more to send its observations on these allegations, and in particular to state whether administrative resolution No.  concerning Mr. Espnola has been revoked or reviewed in the light of the written objections presented by Mr. Espnola before the Ministry of Education and Culture. It also requests the Government to inform the Committee of the reasons which led to the dismissal of trade unionists Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma.(d) The Committee deeply regrets the detention, psychological pressures and threats against trade unionist Cira Novara and her subsequent dismissal and requests the Government to inform it of the specific events and acts on which the charges are based, to state whether a judicial hearing has been instituted, and if so, to specify its outcome.
.Subsequent developments in the case
.Following the Committee's examination of this case in November , the WCOTP sent a communication dated  June  alleging that the ""National Teachers' Co-ordinating Committee"" (which brings together the Paraguyan teachers' organisations) called on teachers to strike throughout the nation on  July  in support of wage demands, in a context in which teachers are denied freedom of association and the right to engage in collective bargaining and to strike. In response, the Ministry of Education and Culture threatened to dismiss and disqualify teachers participating in such a strike, in violation of Convention No. . The text of the communication by the Ministry of Education and Culture was as follows:The Ministry of Education and Culture informs all teachers, heads of households and the population at large that, in response to the concerns expressed by the country's teachers, and in particular to their wish for an overall improvement in their conditions of life, as well as the progress of education in the country, it is working to reach such objectives through the appropriate legal channels.However, at the same time, it reminds the petitioners of the provisions contained in article  of the national Constitution, which states that: ""All Paraguyan citizens have the right to hold public office and employment with no conditions other than fitness for the position in question. Public officials and employees are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes, as well as from collectively leaving their posts."" Furthermore, article  states that: ""All residents are required to comply with and obey this Constitution and the laws, decrees, resolutions and other provisions which the public authorities may issue in accordance with their mandate.""Likewise, the Ministry recalls the provisions of Act No.  on the status of public officials, and in particular the following sections: ""Section : Public officials may not adopt collective resolutions against provisions issued by the competent authorities."" ""Section : Public officials are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes. For the purposes of this Act, a work stoppage is considered as a collective suspension of services, and a strike as a collective absence from work. Strikes shall also include the collective refusal of public officials, or individual refusals which take place within an interval of ten days by more than five officials in the same unit."" ""Section : Public officials who infringe the provisions of the foregoing section will be disqualified from holding public employment for a period of two to five years. Public officials who are found guilty of threatening work stoppages or strikes will be subject to dismissal."" ""Section : Public officials are prohibited from using the premises or property of the administration for any purpose other than the performance of their specific tasks.""Thus, given the rule of law, the Ministry warns those concerned that the above-mentioned sanctions and legal provisions will be applied in the event of any transgressions of said provisions.
.In its communication of  September  the WCOTP alleges that the Caaguaz regional branch of the Teachers' Organisation of Paraguay (OTEP) has been persecuted and harassed. The secretary of the Organisation, Hilda Montiel de Ros, has been suspended from the Francisco Solano Lpez School for having defended the OTEP before the school's students and teachers against accusations made by the school's director. In spite of the fact that these explanations were well received by the students and teachers, on  August ",-1,1988,Paraguay
87,"the school's director relieved this teacher of her functions accusing her of insubordination and rebellion, and requested the Ministry of Education and Culture to fill the vacancy. According to the allegations, this dismissal is unacceptable, inasmuch as the school's director has neither the authority nor the competence to act in this manner, since such procedures fall to the competence of the Ministry. According to the complainant, this case must be viewed against the background of administrative corruption, warnings and the suspensions of certain members of the OTEP. On  August  a delegation composed of teachers from the region, students, heads of households and the attorney for the Organisation's regional branch presented a formal complaint before the Ministry of Education. They were assured that a solution would be found to the problem of the teacher, Mrs. Hilda Montiel de Ros.
.The International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW) alleges in its communication of  November  that three members of the ""ONONDIVEPA"" National Peasants' Union, Messrs. Arcadio Flores, Jos Melgarejo and Aurelio Pereira had been detained without a warrant on  November  by members of the armed forces in Colonia Torybet, and that their current whereabouts are unknown.
.Moreover, IFPAAW alleges that on  November members of the third cavalry division in Curuguaty, Department of Canendiy, brutally beat a group of  peasants. On  November some  members of the army fired on a group of  peasants in Tava-I and Almeida, Guauauvi district, Department of San Pedro, and imprisoned most of them in the Curuguaty post. These are armed assaults on groups of peasants who have peacefully occupied uncultivated land in order to draw the Government's attention to the growing problems of over , peasants who still have no land, in spite of the Government's creation of the Rural Development Co-ordinating Committee.
.The Committee deeply deplores the fact that the Government has not sent any of the information requested by the Committee and that, owing to the time elapsed, the Committee has been forced to examine the cases without the benefit of the Government's replies to the allegations in question. The Committee must recall the considerations presented in its First Report (para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ), which it has had to repeat on several occasions: the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, as the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be brought against them.
.Given the seriousness of the allegations in these cases which concern, inter alia, the detention of trade unionists, various acts of anti-union discrimination and serious legal restrictions on the trade union rights of public officials and employees, the Committee deplores the Government's absence of co-operation with the Committee's procedures. The Committee urges the Government in the future to send detailed replies to allegations without delay.
.As regards Case No. , the Committee reiterates the conclusions which it formulated at its November  meeting, namely, that the lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the recognition of the executive committee of the trade union of Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. and the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by that enterprise constitute a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned. Bearing in mind that the authorities' refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dates back to , the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to ensuring that legislation will facilitate the expeditious disposition of proceedings involving labour-related matters. Moreover, since the Government has provided no information concerning the declaration of illegality of the strike which, according to the complainants, was followed by  per cent of the workers of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. enterprise, the Committee again emphasises that the right to strike constitutes an essential means for workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests, and that limitations on, or the prohibition of strikes may only apply in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (those where an interruption could endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). It considers that this definition does not cover this present case.
.As regards Case No. , the Committee emphasises that the complainant organisation has alleged that teachers were dismissed or otherwise persecuted owing to their trade union activities. Consequently, given the Government's failure to reply, the Committee draws its attention to Article  of Convention No. , which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"", and emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.In addition, the Committee deplores that the Ministry of Education and Culture reacted to the call for a national strike on  July  by the National Teachers' Co-ordinating Body to obtain wage increases, by threatening dismissals and disqualifications. In general, on the question of restrictions which may be imposed by legislation on the trade union rights of teachers who are also public officials, the Committee emphasises that workers in the education sector should enjoy the right to establish trade union organisations, to bargain collectively and to resort to strikes (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), paras.  and ; see also the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , paras. ,  and ). The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees these rights to workers in the education sector.
.Lastly, as regards Case No.  concerning the detention and violent assaults by the armed forces on groups of peasants who, according to allegations, were peacefully occupying uncultivated lands, and concerning the detention, without warrant, of Messrs. Arcadio Flores, Jos Melgarejo and Aurelio Pereira, members of the National Peasants' Union, the Committee regrets this climate of violence. It requests the Government to confirm whether Messrs. Flores, Melgarejo and Pereira have been released and requests all parties involved to seek to resolve peacefully disputes arising from agrarian reform and rural development.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deplores the fact that since November  the Government has failed to provide any of the information requested in these three cases. The Committee deplores the Government's lack of co-operation and urges it in the future to submit detailed replies without delay.(b) As regards the proceedings for the recognition of the executive committee of the trade union of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. (Paraguay Cotton Company), and the reinstatement of trade union leaders dismissed since , the Committee again emphasises that the absence of a court ruling over such a long period of time constitutes a denial of justice, and therefore a denial of trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the legislation will facilitate labour-related judicial proceedings.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that workers in cotton companies do not provide an essential service in the strict sense of the term, and consequently that their right to strike should not be subject to serious restrictions or prohibitions, either in law or in practice.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees to workers in the education sector the right to establish trade unions, to bargain collectively and to strike.(e) The Committee draws the Government's attention to Article  of Convention No. , which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"". It emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination and requests the Government to take measures for the reinstatement of the teacher trade unionist, Mrs. Montiel de Ros.(f) Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the trade unionists of the National Peasants' Union, Messrs. Flores, Melgarejo and Pereira have been released, and requests all parties involved to seek to resolve peacefully problems which may arise from agrarian reform and rural development.
.The World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) presented a complaint against the Government of Paraguay alleging the violation of trade union rights in communications of  April,  May and November . The Government has not sent its observations on any of the outstanding allegations, even though it has been requested to do so on several occasions.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication of  April  the WCOTP states that Mr. Juan Gabriel Espnola, the recently elected General Secretary of the Teachers' Organisation of Paraguay",-1,1988,Paraguay
88,"(OTEP), an affiliate of the WCOTP, was transferred from his post as regular teacher in the ""Vicepresidente Snchez"" National School in Asuncin, to the National School of Commerce in La Paloma, some  kilometres from Asuncin. This transfer was ordered by means of resolution No.  of  March , which also reclassified Mr. Espnola as an alternate teacher, although he had been a regular teacher for five years. The WCOTP attaches several documents which evidence the prominent trade union activities of this teacher, who participated actively in the National Minimum Wage Campaign launched by the OTEP in . Mr. Espnola appealed the ministerial resolution on  March  before the Ministry of Education and Culture, arguing that these measures were unjustified.
.In a communication of  May  the WCOTP denounces the dismissal of Antonia Jara Paredes, the Principal of the ""Coronel Feliciano Duarte"" school, and that of Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma, owing to their trade union activities. Both are trade union officials of the OTEP.
.In a communication of November , the WCOTP alleges that on  September , at approximately  p.m., plain clothes policemen entered the house of Mr. Roque Vera and proceeded to detain four persons, including Mrs. Cira Novara, a teacher and an active member of the OTEP. Mrs. Novara was led to the ""Buen Pastor"" penitentiary and charged with subversive activities, under Act No.  on the protection of law and order and the freedom of individuals. The WCOTP states that, according to information it has received, Mrs. Novara was subjected to psychological pressure and received threats of sexual abuse during her detention. Mrs. Novara was released on  October , but was dismissed from her teaching post. The WCOTP states that the authorities consider trade union activities to be ""subversive"" and that this appears to have been the reason for Mrs. Novara's detention.
.In spite of the time which has elapsed since the allegations were submitted, and in spite of various requests for information addressed by the ILO to the Government, no reply has been received.
.Before examining the substance of this case, the Committee considers it necessary to recall the observations it made in its first report (paragraph , approved by the Governing Body in March ), and which it has had occasion to repeat several times. The purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact; the Committee is confident that, if the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed replies to such allegations as are put forward by complainant organisations.
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not sent any of the information requested by the Committee, and that for this reason, owing to the time elapsed, the Committee must proceed to examine the case without the benefit of the Government's observations on the allegations in question.
.As regards the allegation concerning the transfer and reclassification of Mr. Juan Gabriel Espnola, the General Secretary of the Teachers' Organisation of Paraguay (OTEP), by means of a ministerial resolution, and the dismissal of OTEP trade union leaders, Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma, on the grounds of trade union activities, the Committee recalls the principle according to which no worker should be subject to discrimination in his or her employment owing to legitimate trade union activities or membership. Moreover, trade unionists should enjoy adequate protection against any acts of anti-union discrimination not only in respect of their hiring and dismissal, but also in respect of any discriminatory measure taken during their employment, and in particular against transfers, delays in promotion and other prejudicial action (in this connection, see th Report, Case No.  (Uruguay), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (Mali), para. ).
.The Committee again urges the Government to send its observations on these allegations, and in particular to state whether administrative resolution No.  concerning trade union leader Juan Gabriel Espnola has been revoked or reviewed in response to the written objections presented by Mr. Espnola to the Ministry of Education and Culture on  March . It also requests the Government to inform the Committee of the grounds for the dismissal of trade unionists Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma.
.The Committee deeply regrets the detention, psychological pressure and threats against the trade unionist Cira Novara, as well as her subsequent dismissal under Act No.  on the protection of law and order and the freedom of individuals. It recalls that a truly free and independent trade union movement cannot develop in a climate of violence and uncertainty. Moreover, the detention of trade union leaders without specific criminal charges against them involves restrictions on trade union rights (see th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).
.The Committee urges the Government to supply information concerning the specific events and acts on which the charges against Mrs. Novara are based, to state whether there has been a judicial inquiry, and if so, to specify the outcome of the same, as well as the reasons for her dismissal.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not sent any information requested by the Committee, and that for this reason the Committee must, owing to the time elapsed, examine the case without the benefit of the Government's replies to the allegations.(b) The Committee can only draw to the Government's attention the principle that no worker should be subject to discrimination in employment owing to his trade union activities or membership.(c) As regards the transfer and reclassification of the General Secretary of the OTEP, Mr. Juan Gabriel Espnola, and the dismissal of teachers Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma owing to their trade union activities, the Committee urges the Government once more to send its observations on these allegations, and in particular to state whether administrative resolution No.  concerning Mr. Espnola has been revoked or reviewed in the light of the written objections presented by Mr. Espnola before the Ministry of Education and Culture. It also requests the Government to inform the Committee of the reasons which led to the dismissal of trade unionists Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma.(d) The Committee deeply regrets the detention, psychological pressures and threats against trade unionist Cira Novara and her subsequent dismissal and requests the Government to inform it of the specific events and acts on which the charges are based, to state whether a judicial hearing has been instituted, and if so, to specify its outcome.",-1,1988,Paraguay
89,".The complaints are made in communications from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the International Union of Food and Allied Workers Associations (UITA) dated  and  February  respectively. The UITA submitted additional information in a communication of  March . The Government replied in communications of  and  April .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that, in this case, the basic allegation made by the complainant concerns the refusal of the General Labour Directorate to register the executive committee of the CAPSA union considered by the complainant as authentic and headed by Mr. Salcedo, while nevertheless agreeing to register another executive committee (headed by Mr. Ramrez and Mr. Melgarejo) which, in the opinion of the complainant organisation, serves the employers' interests and is the product of connivance between the company and the labour authorities. The Committee takes note of the Government's reply. It notes that it has claimed that there were serious irregularities in the ordinary general assembly at which the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo was elected, and denies that Mr. Salcedo was arrested.
.In this respect, the Committee wishes to emphasise firmly that, irrespective of whether or not the irregularities alleged by the Government took place, when two executive committees each proclaim themselves to be the legitimate one, the dispute should be settled by the judicial authority or an independent arbiter and not by the administrative authority. In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that the General Directorate of Labour, in deciding in favour of the group headed by Mr. Ramrez and Mr. Melgarejo, has engaged in anti-union interference in violation of Article  of Convention No.  which stipulates that the public authorities must refrain from any interference that would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities. The Committee urges the Government to leave the task of settling this type of situation to the judicial authorities in the future.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government has not commented specifically on the following allegations concerning acts of anti-union persecution against the union group led by Mr. Salcedo and acts favouring the creation of a union movement with ties to the employer: first, the dismissal of union leaders and members of the group headed by Mr. Salcedo (although some have since been reinstated); secondly, the action taken, especially through the police, to prevent five regular assemblies from being convened by Mr. Salcedo, and the detention of the group's leaders for a number of days. In addition, it notes that a small number of workers are said by the complainant organisation to have attended the general assembly called by Mr. Melgarejo.
.In this respect, the Committee must deplore the fact that the general assemblies called by Mr. Salcedo were repeatedly prevented by the police and that members of the executive committee were detained. It also regrets the dismissals alleged in this case and stresses that the legislation should provide for sufficiently effective civil remedies and penal sanctions so as to deter acts of anti-union discrimination and of interference in union life and activities.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that, in future, the labour authorities abstain from any act of interference in matters pertaining to the election of union leaders.b) The Committee deeply deplores the detentions and other acts of interference and anti-union discrimination alleged in this case, and requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the legislation guarantees adequate protection against such acts through sufficiently effective civil remedies and penal sanctions.c) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the progress in and results of the legal proceedings set in motion by the CAPSA Union in relation to the questions raised in this case, in particular the dismissal of union members and the refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo.

90,".The Committee has examined Case No. , submitted by the International Union of Food and Allied Workers Associations (IUF) and the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), on two occasions and presented interim reports (see th and th Reports, paras. - and -, respectively, approved by the Governing Body at its th (May-June ) and th (November ) Sessions).
.As regards Case No. , submitted by the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP), the Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). Subsequently the WCOTP submitted new allegations in communications of  June and  September .
.The complaint in Case No.  was presented in a communication from the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), dated  November .
.At its meeting of November , the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government for its observations on Cases Nos. ,  and  (see th Report, para. ). Specifically, the Committee noted that, despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the complaints and the seriousness of the allegations contained therein, the Government had not transmitted the observations or information which had been requested. The Committee drew the attention of the Government to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of these cases at its next meeting, even if the observations requested from the Government had not been received in due time. Consequently, the Committee urged the Government to transmit its observations as soon as possible.
.The Committee has not received the observations and information which it had requested from the Government concerning these three cases.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations in this case concern the existence of two executive committees for the trade union of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. (Paraguay Cotton Company, CAPSA) (one of which, according to the complainant, was set up and is influenced and directed by the enterprise, and has been recognised by the Labour Directorate); the dismissal of several trade union leaders, including Pedro Salcedo; police interference in several meetings called by Mr. Salcedo and the declaration that a strike called by the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo was illegal. According to the Government, the Labour Directorate was awaiting a court decision regarding the legitimacy of one of the two executive committees, for the purpose of registering it. Nevertheless, the refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dated back to  and, according to the complainant, it was in that year that the Labour Directorate recognised the other executive committee. The Conciliation and Arbitration Board of the Ministry of Labour ordered the negotiation of a new collective agreement and specified that the other executive committee was to represent workers in the negotiations. More specifically, as concerns the strike that began during the harvest on  August  and was followed by  per cent of workers in the CAPSA enterprise, the complainant reports that the strike was suspended at the request of the enterprise on  September when the Conciliation and Arbitration Board declared the strike illegal.
.In its previous examination of this case, the Committee formulated the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):(b) The Committee requests the Government rapidly to inform it of the outcome of the current legal proceedings concerning the recognition of the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo, the reinstatement of dismissed union leaders, the refund of trade union contributions retained by the employer since  and the recognition of the other executive committee by the Labour Directorate. It recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that it has stated on numerous occasions that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to supply information and its observations on the application concerning the banning of the strike by workers in the CAPSA company, together with any information on developments in the labour dispute within this company.
.Previous examination of the case
.At its meeting of November , the Committee formulated the following recommendations concerning outstanding allegations (see th Report, para. ):(c) As regards the transfer and reclassification of the General Secretary of the OTEP, Mr. Juan Gabriel Espnola, and the dismissal of teachers Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma owing to their trade union activities, the Committee urges the Government once more to send its observations on these allegations, and in particular to state whether administrative resolution No.  concerning Mr. Espnola has been revoked or reviewed in the light of the written objections presented by Mr. Espnola before the Ministry of Education and Culture. It also requests the Government to inform the Committee of the reasons which led to the dismissal of trade unionists Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma.(d) The Committee deeply regrets the detention, psychological pressures and threats against trade unionist Cira Novara and her subsequent dismissal and requests the Government to inform it of the specific events and acts on which the charges are based, to state whether a judicial hearing has been instituted, and if so, to specify its outcome.
.Subsequent developments in the case
.Following the Committee's examination of this case in November , the WCOTP sent a communication dated  June  alleging that the ""National Teachers' Co-ordinating Committee"" (which brings together the Paraguyan teachers' organisations) called on teachers to strike throughout the nation on  July  in support of wage demands, in a context in which teachers are denied freedom of association and the right to engage in collective bargaining and to strike. In response, the Ministry of Education and Culture threatened to dismiss and disqualify teachers participating in such a strike, in violation of Convention No. . The text of the communication by the Ministry of Education and Culture was as follows:The Ministry of Education and Culture informs all teachers, heads of households and the population at large that, in response to the concerns expressed by the country's teachers, and in particular to their wish for an overall improvement in their conditions of life, as well as the progress of education in the country, it is working to reach such objectives through the appropriate legal channels.However, at the same time, it reminds the petitioners of the provisions contained in article  of the national Constitution, which states that: ""All Paraguyan citizens have the right to hold public office and employment with no conditions other than fitness for the position in question. Public officials and employees are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes, as well as from collectively leaving their posts."" Furthermore, article  states that: ""All residents are required to comply with and obey this Constitution and the laws, decrees, resolutions and other provisions which the public authorities may issue in accordance with their mandate.""Likewise, the Ministry recalls the provisions of Act No.  on the status of public officials, and in particular the following sections: ""Section : Public officials may not adopt collective resolutions against provisions issued by the competent authorities."" ""Section : Public officials are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes. For the purposes of this Act, a work stoppage is considered as a collective suspension of services, and a strike as a collective absence from work. Strikes shall also include the collective refusal of public officials, or individual refusals which take place within an interval of ten days by more than five officials in the same unit."" ""Section : Public officials who infringe the provisions of the foregoing section will be disqualified from holding public employment for a period of two to five years. Public officials who are found guilty of threatening work stoppages or strikes will be subject to dismissal."" ""Section : Public officials are prohibited from using the premises or property of the administration for any purpose other than the performance of their specific tasks.""Thus, given the rule of law, the Ministry warns those concerned that the above-mentioned sanctions and legal provisions will be applied in the event of any transgressions of said provisions.
.In its communication of  September  the WCOTP alleges that the Caaguaz regional branch of the Teachers' Organisation of Paraguay (OTEP) has been persecuted and harassed. The secretary of the Organisation, Hilda Montiel de Ros, has been suspended from the Francisco Solano Lpez School for having defended the OTEP before the school's students and teachers against accusations made by the school's director. In spite of the fact that these explanations were well received by the students and teachers, on  August ",-1,1988,Paraguay

On  August  a delegation composed of teachers from the region, students, heads of households and the attorney for the Organisation's regional branch presented a formal complaint before the Ministry of Education. They were assured that a solution would be found to the problem of the teacher, Mrs. Hilda Montiel de Ros.
.The International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW) alleges in its communication of  November  that three members of the ""ONONDIVEPA"" National Peasants' Union, Messrs. Arcadio Flores, Jos Melgarejo and Aurelio Pereira had been detained without a warrant on  November  by members of the armed forces in Colonia Torybet, and that their current whereabouts are unknown.
.Moreover, IFPAAW alleges that on  November members of the third cavalry division in Curuguaty, Department of Canendiy, brutally beat a group of  peasants.

.The Committee on Freedom of Association last examined this case at its meeting in May . (See the Committee's th Report, paragraphs -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).)
.Since the last examination of the case, the Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  September . The Paraguayan Cotton Company Workers' Union (CAPSA) sent further information in a letter dated  September  and the International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) sent a letter dated  September  in support of the allegations and requests made by the CAPSA trade union.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,",-1,1988,Paraguay
92," (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations mainly concern the refusal by the General Labour Directorate to register the executive committee of the CAPSA trade union, headed by Mr. Pedro Salcedo, considered by the complainant organisation to be the genuine executive. Instead, the Labour Directorate registered another executive committee, headed by Mr. Juan Ramn Ramrez, which according to the complainant organisation serves the employers' interests. The allegations also referred to the dismissal of a number of union leaders, including Pedro Salcedo, and to police intervention in five meetings called by Mr. Salcedo, preventing them from continuing.
.In May , the Committee invited the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that in future the labour authorities refrain from any act of interference in matters pertaining to the election of union leaders.(b) The Committee deeply deplores the detentions and other acts of interference and anti-union discrimination alleged in this case and requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the legislation guarantees adequate protection against such acts through sufficiently effective civil remedies and penal sanctions.(c) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the progress in and results of the legal proceedings set in motion by the CAPSA union in relation to the questions raised in this case, in particular the dismissal of union members and the refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo.
.In a letter dated  September  the Government states that Mr. Pedro Salcedo, General Secretary of the CAPSA trade union was indeed dismissed. He appealed to the courts to be reinstated. The relevant case (entitled Gumercindo Notario, Pedro Salcedo and others versus CAPSA) has now reached the final stage of the proceedings and is before the Labour Court of Appeal awaiting its final ruling, which will be communicated to the ILO.
.Concerning the alleged refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Pedro Salcedo, the Government states that the allegation is false and that the truth is that there are two trade union executives within the company, one headed by Mr. Juan Ramn Ramrez and the other by Mr. Pedro Salcedo. Both executives applied for registration in letters to the Labour Directorate dated  and  March  respectively. The legal advisers to the Labour Directorate, in Opinion No. /IV/, recommended that no decision should be taken until the National Audit Office (""Tribunal de Cuentas""), the first court of the judicial authorities, gave a ruling as to the legality of one or other of them. The Labour Directorate, sharing the views of its advisers, duly adopted those concerned accordingly. The Government states that it will inform the ILO of the final decision in the matter.
.In a letter dated  September , the Paraguayan Cotton Company Workers' Union states that on  March  the union held its general meeting to discuss its balance sheet and annual report and to elect new officers. The list of elected officers was sent (in accordance with the Labour Code) to the Labour Directorate.
.The CAPSA union states that so far the judicial authorities have taken no decision in the cases concerning recognition of the executive committee headed by Pedro Salcedo; the reinstatement of five dismissed leaders; the refund by the company of the money held as trade union contributions since February ; and the complaint against the Labour Directorate for unlawful recognition of the other executive committee. Nevertheless, on  May , the judicial authorities decided to grant the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo possession of the trade union premises which, until then, had been occupied by the other executive.
.The CAPSA union states that in view of this situation and the number of unresolved problems the workers decided at a meeting on  August  to call a strike as from  August. The claims made by the union headed by Pedro Salcedo included a demand that the employers negotiate on the dismissals and suspensions that the company wanted to make and that the latter hold discussions with the union, as well as a demand that the company reinstate the dismissed trade union leaders and refund the trade union contributions that had been deducted by it since February . The strike (which was supported by  per cent of the workers of CAPSA) was suspended following an injunction (""recurso de amparo"") applied for by the company and a telegram from the Ministry of Labour requesting that the strike be called off so that a tripartite meeting - Ministry-union-company - could be held within  hours. The meeting took place on  September  before the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of the Ministry of Labour. At the meeting the company representatives stated that although the problem of recognising one or other executive committee was before the courts, they recommended resolving the issue by the merger of the two committees. According to the complainant, the real executive committee confined itself to presenting the claims which justified the strike, while the representative of the Ministry granted the employers a specified period of time in which to reply. On  September, at a further meeting, the company rejected the union's claims. Subsequently the Conciliation and Arbitration Board decided: to declare the strike illegal and to put an end to individual contracts of employment and negotiate a new collective agreement; in these negotiations the workers were represented by the other executive, which is considered by the workers - who gave massive support to the strike - as being set up, influenced and manipulated by the company.
.In conclusion, the complainant states that this series of arbitrary acts, contradictions and delays is prejudicial to the workers' legitimate interests, their rights and trade union freedom and, consequently, infringes the international labour Conventions ratified by Paraguay. It therefore requests the ILO to consider the possibility of sending representatives to carry out an on-the-spot investigation into the allegations since, in view of the seasonal nature of the activity, time is an essential factor.
.The Committee observes that the allegations in this case refer basically to the existence of two executive committees of the CAPSA trade union, one of which, according to the complainant, was set up by and is influenced and manipulated by the company; this is the one recognised by the Labour Directorate. The allegations also concern the dismissal of a number of trade union leaders, including Pedro Salcedo; police disruption of a number of meetings convened by Mr. Salcedo; and the banning of a strike called by the executive committee headed by him. The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the Labour Directorate is awaiting the court ruling as to the legality of one or other of the two executive committees before it can follow up the applications for registration. The Committee nevertheless observes that the refusal the register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo goes back to  and that, according to the complainant, that was the year in which the Labour Directorate recognised the other executive committee. Furthermore the Committee notes that the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of the Ministry of Labour had decided that a new collective agreement should be negotiated and that the workers should be represented in these negotiations by the other executive committee.
.With regard to the existence of two executive committees within the trade union, one of which is allegedly manipulated by the employer, and the dismissal of five trade union leaders including Mr. Pedro Salcedo, the Committee recalls the need to lay down explicity in legislation remedies and penalties for acts of anti-union discrimination and acts of interference by employers in workers' organisations in order to ensure the effective application of Article  of Convention No.  which requires that workers' and employers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. (See th Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Costa Rica), paragraph .)
.As regards the allegations of pressure or favouritism, the Committee has stated on numerous occasions that by according favourable or unfavourable treatment to a given organisation as compared with others, a government may be able to influence the choice of workers of the organisation which they intend to join. In addition, a government which deliberately acts in this manner violates the principle, laid down in Convention No. , that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict the rights provided for in the Convention or impede their lawful exercise. (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, third edition, , para. .)
.The Committee requests the Government rapidly to inform it of the outcome of the current legal proceedings concerning the recognition of the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo, the reinstatement of dismissed leaders, the refund of trade union contributions retained by the employer since  and the recognition of the other executive committee by the Labour Directorate in",0,1988,Paraguay
93,". The Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.
.As regards the strike which began during the harvest on  August  with the support of  per cent of the workers of the CAPSA undertaking, the Committee notes that according to the complainant the strike was suspended by an injunction (""recurso de amparo"") applied for by the company and that on  September the Concilation and Arbitration Board declared the strike illegal.
.The Committee considers that the complaints referring to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they concern the exercise of trade union rights; it considers that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their economic, social and occupational interests. (See Digest of decisions, paras.  and .) Consequently the Committee requests the Government to supply information and its observations on the allegation concerning the banning of this strike.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee recalls the need for legislation to lay down explicitly remedies and penalties for acts of interference by employers in workers' organisations in order to ensure the effective application of Article  of Convention No. .(b) The Committee requests the Government rapidly to inform it of the outcome of the current legal proceedings concerning the recognition of the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo, the reinstatement of dismissed union leaders, the refund of trade union contributions retained by the employer since  and the recognition of the other executive committee by the Labour Directorate. It recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that it has stated on numerous occasions that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. Consequently the Committee requests the Government to supply information and its observations on the allegation concerning the banning of the strike by workers in the CAPSA company, together with any information on developments in the labour dispute within this company.
.The complaints are made in communications from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the International Union of Food and Allied Workers Associations (UITA) dated  and  February  respectively. The UITA submitted additional information in a communication of  March . The Government replied in communications of  and  April .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that, in this case, the basic allegation made by the complainant concerns the refusal of the General Labour Directorate to register the executive committee of the CAPSA union considered by the complainant as authentic and headed by Mr. Salcedo, while nevertheless agreeing to register another executive committee (headed by Mr. Ramrez and Mr. Melgarejo) which, in the opinion of the complainant organisation, serves the employers' interests and is the product of connivance between the company and the labour authorities. The Committee takes note of the Government's reply. It notes that it has claimed that there were serious irregularities in the ordinary general assembly at which the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo was elected, and denies that Mr. Salcedo was arrested.
.In this respect, the Committee wishes to emphasise firmly that, irrespective of whether or not the irregularities alleged by the Government took place, when two executive committees each proclaim themselves to be the legitimate one, the dispute should be settled by the judicial authority or an independent arbiter and not by the administrative authority. In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that the General Directorate of Labour, in deciding in favour of the group headed by Mr. Ramrez and Mr. Melgarejo, has engaged in anti-union interference in violation of Article  of Convention No.  which stipulates that the public authorities must refrain from any interference that would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities. The Committee urges the Government to leave the task of settling this type of situation to the judicial authorities in the future.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government has not commented specifically on the following allegations concerning acts of anti-union persecution against the union group led by Mr. Salcedo and acts favouring the creation of a union movement with ties to the employer: first, the dismissal of union leaders and members of the group headed by Mr. Salcedo (although some have since been reinstated); secondly, the action taken, especially through the police, to prevent five regular assemblies from being convened by Mr. Salcedo, and the detention of the group's leaders for a number of days. In addition, it notes that a small number of workers are said by the complainant organisation to have attended the general assembly called by Mr. Melgarejo.
.In this respect, the Committee must deplore the fact that the general assemblies called by Mr. Salcedo were repeatedly prevented by the police and that members of the executive committee were detained. It also regrets the dismissals alleged in this case and stresses that the legislation should provide for sufficiently effective civil remedies and penal sanctions so as to deter acts of anti-union discrimination and of interference in union life and activities.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that, in future, the labour authorities abstain from any act of interference in matters pertaining to the election of union leaders.b) The Committee deeply deplores the detentions and other acts of interference and anti-union discrimination alleged in this case, and requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the legislation guarantees adequate protection against such acts through sufficiently effective civil remedies and penal sanctions.c) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the progress in and results of the legal proceedings set in motion by the CAPSA Union in relation to the questions raised in this case, in particular the dismissal of union members and the refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo.

94,".The Committee examined Case No.  at its meetings of November  and November  (see th Report, paras.  to , and st Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th and st Sessions (November  and November )).
.The complaint in Case No.  is contained in a communication from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the World Federation of Industrial Workers (WFIW), dated  April . The Government replied in a communication of  October .
.At its February  meeting, the Committee noted that the Government had not supplied full information concerning all of the pending allegations, in spite of the time elapsed since the last examination of Case No. , and since the presentation of allegations in Case No. ; the Committee accordingly informed the Government that it would submit a report on the substance of the cases at its next meeting in accordance with its procedure (th Report, para. ), even if the observations requested from the Government had not been received.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) Noting that the legislation does not give adequate protection against actions of anti-trade union discrimination, the Committee draws the legislative aspect of the cases to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, and requests the Government to take measures with a view to adopting legislative provisions which effectively protect trade unionists and workers against dismissals based on trade union activities.b) The Committee requests the Government to respect in the future, the principles outlined in the foregoing paragraphs concerning trade union autonomy in the drafting of trade union by-laws and in the election of executive boards, and non-interference in trade union meetings, and to take measures to remove the requirement for administrative authorisation to hold trade union meetings.",0,1986,Paraguay
95,".The Committee has already examined this case on four occasions, the last being at its November  meeting, when it presented an interim report. (See th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session.) Since then the Government has not furnished any information or observations concerning this complaint. On the other hand, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) sent new allegations in a communication of  December .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations which remained outstanding in this case related to the detention of trade union activists and leaders whose names are supplied by the complainants, to violent repression of peaceful trade union demonstrations, and to acts of interference and pressure exerted against trade union organisations and their leaders.
.In particular the complainants referred to the climate of violence and repression affecting the trade union movement in ,  and  in the hospital, banking, transport, press, teaching and agricultural sectors. The Government had partially responded to the various outstanding questions.
.Nevertheless, at its November  Session, the Governing Body approved the following interim conclusions of the Committee:(a) The Committee notes with interest that the Government has replied to certain allegations, but regrets that it has as yet supplied no observations on several of the serious allegations made against it by the complainants.(b) Consequently, on the factual issues, the Committee once again requests the Government to state whether it is correct that members of the pro-Government party assaulted doctors and nurses on the hospital premises who were treating persons injured by the forces of order when a trade union demonstration was repressed on  May , as affirmed by the ICFTU in a communication of  May , and if so to state whether a judicial inquiry has been instituted following this repression to determine who is responsible.(c) The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the ICFTU's allegations dated  April  and  May  respectively concerning the imprisonment in March  of Raquel Aquino, a leader of secondary-school students, in the Pastor prison and the arrest, on  May , of agricultural workers' leaders Marcelino Corazn Medina, Pedro Gamana, Carmelino Torales, Acadio Flores and Teodoro Gonzlez. In particular, it requests the Government to state precisely on what grounds they were imprisoned, to furnish the text of the court judgements concerning them if they have been tried, and to specify whether these persons have since been released.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the outcome of the appeal against dismissal lodged by the trade union leader Sebastin Rodrguez, former General Secretary of the Bus Drivers' Union (route No. ) who is said to have been dismissed in  for trade union reasons.(e) On the legal issues, as regards the denial to public employees of the right to organise in trade unions and the restrictions on their freedom to negotiate their conditions of employment collectively, the Committee requests the Government to ensure the amendment of Act No.  in respect of the public service (sections  and ) so as to include specific legislative provisions on the right to organise of public employees and to introduce machinery for the settlement of collective disputes in the public service in which the persons concerned will have confidence.(f) As regards the ban on strikes by doctors and nurses employed in a public hospital, the Committee requests the Government to ensure the adoption of specific provisions to compensate, by introducing appropriate conciliation and arbitration procedures, for the fact that there is no right to strike in this essential service.(g) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case regarding Conventions Nos.  and .
.Since then, the Government has furnished no reply on these various points.
.On the other hand, in a telegram of  December , the ICFTU reports the arrest of other trade union leaders identified by name: Ronal Orrego, Oscar Acosta, Edilberto Vargas, Gabriel Espinola, Celso Veazquez, Juan Galiano, Marina Arron, Juanita Arracela and Teresa Godoy.
.The Committee is aware of the fact that the violations of freedom of association in this case are alleged to have taken place between  and , under the former Government.
.Nevertheless, the Committee notes with regret that, in spite of the time which has elapsed since the last examination of this case, and in spite of the ILO's repeated requests addressed to the former Government and to the present Government for their comments concerning this complaint, no reply has been received.
.In these circumstances, and in accordance with the procedural rules (see paragraph  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee must, as with Case No.  which it examined in May-June  (see nd Report, paras.  to ), submit a report on the substance of the matter, even in the absence of information from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government once again that the purpose of the whole procedure set up in the ILO for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. If the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for their own reputation of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them (see First Report of the Committee, para. ).
.As regards the substance of the case, the Committee notes that the Government has not refuted the allegations of the complainant confederations, and considers that, in these circumstances, the principles of freedom of association concerning the safety and freedom of trade unionists have not been respected.
.The Committee recalls that actions which can be attributed to a former government continue to engage the responsibility of a new government, and that any lack of diligence by a State to prevent violations of human rights and trade union rights is contrary to the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by a country.
.Consequently, the Committee again appeals to the present Government to ensure respect of freedom of association in law and in practice. In this regard, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relations with civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference in , particularly its statement that the absence of civil liberties makes the concept of trade union rights meaningless.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply regrets that, in spite of the time elapsed since the last examination of this case, the Government has not furnished any comments or observations on the serious allegations outstanding in this matter.(b) The Committee recognises that the violations of freedom of association alleged in this complaint took place between  and  under the former government. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls that actions attributed to a former government continue to engage the responsibility of a new government.(c) Consequently, the Committee appeals to the Government particularly to ensure respect of freedom of association in law and in practice.(d) In particular, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of all judicial inquiries which have may have taken place following the repression of a trade union demonstration at the Clinicas Hospital in May . It also requests the Government to furnish information concerning the fate of several trade unionists who have been indentified by name by the complainant organisations, and arrested in  and , namely, Raquel Aquino, Marcelino Corazn Medina, Pedro Gamana, Carmelino Torales, Acadio Flores, Teodoro Gonzlez, Ronal Orrego, Oscar Acosta, Edilberto Vargas, Gabriel Espinola, Celso Velazquez, Juan Galiano, Marina Arron, Juanita Arracela and Teresa Godoy.(e) On the legal issues, the Committee again requests the Government to ensure the amendment of Act No.  regarding the Public Service so as to guarantee trade union rights and the right of collective bargaining to workers in the public health sector, as well as to take measures for the adoption of specific provisions to compensate the denial of the right to strike in public hospitals.(f) The Committee again draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case, in the context of Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Paraguay.
.The Committee has already examined this case on four occasions, the last being at its November  meeting, when it presented an interim report (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )). Since then the Government transmitted certain information and observations in communications of  January and  September . The ICFTU sent new allegations in communications of  and  December  and  January and",0,1985,Paraguay
96," February .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations which remain outstanding in this case relate to the assault by members of the pro-government party against doctors and nurses at the Clnicas Hospital who were attending to persons who had been injured during a trade union demonstration held on  May ; the detention of trade union leaders Raquel Aquino (March ), Marcelino Corazn Medina, Pedro Gamana, Carmelino Torales, Arcadio Flores and Teodoro Gonzlez ( May ); the dismissal, for trade union reasons, of trade union leader Sebastin Rodrguez in ; and to certain legislative questions which had been brought to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.As regards the above-mentioned outstanding allegations, the Governing Body, at its November  meeting, adopted a number of recommendations at the invitation of the Committee:(a) The Committee notes with interest that the Government has replied to certain allegations, but regrets that it has as yet supplied no observations on several of the serious allegations made against it by the complainants.(b) Consequently, on the factual issues, the Committee once again requests the Government to state whether it is correct that members of the pro-government party assaulted doctors and nurses on hospital premises who were treating persons injured by the forces of order when a trade union demonstration was repressed on  May , as affirmed by the ICFTU in a communication of  May , and if so to state whether a judicial inquiry has been instituted following this repression to determine who is responsible.(c) The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the ICFTU's allegations dated  April  and  May  respectively concerning the imprisonment in March  of Raquel Aquino, a leader of secondary-school students, in the Pastor prison and the arrest, on  May , of agricultural workers' leaders Marcelino Corazn Medina, Pedro Gamana, Carmelino Torales, Arcadio Flores and Teodoro Gonzlez. In particular, it requests the Government to state precisely on what grounds they were imprisoned, to furnish the text of the court judgements concerning them if they have been tried, and to specify whether these persons have since been released.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the outcome of the appeal against dismissal lodged by the trade union leader Sebastin Rodrguez, former General Secretary of the Bus Drivers' Union (Route No. ) who is said to have been dismissed in  for trade union reasons.
.In its telegram of  December , the ICFTU alleges that on  December  the following trade union leaders were detained in different parts of the country: Oscar Acosta, Secretary General of the Journalists' and Radio Caritas Trade Union; Marina Arrn, trade union leader of the Royal Bank of Paraguay; Elsa Mereles, President of the Asuncin Clnicas Hospital Workers' and Nurses' Association. The ICFTU affirms that these trade union leaders were detained without just cause three days before the so-called ""March for Life"", a demonstration convened by the Inter-Trade Union Workers' Movement (MIT), was to be held.
.In another telegram of  December  the ICFTU expresses its concern over a new series of arrests mainly involving the leaders of the MIT. The persons concerned are: Ronald Orrego, Edilberto Vargas, Gabriel Espnola, Celso Velzquez, Juan Galiano, Juanita Arracela and Teresa Godoy. These persons are being detained in the prisons of the National Guard.
.In a telegram of  January  the ICFTU alleges that the ""Hoy"" publishing house dismissed all trade union leaders and delegates belonging to the Asuncin Journalists' Trade Union. These dismissals took place while negotiations were being held with the trade union concerning the introduction of new technologies. The trade unionists are: Eduardo Arce, Ramn Casco, Estela Rufenelli, Marit Ocampos, Teresa Godoy, Idilio Mndez, Hugo Villalba and five other workers.
.In a communication of  February  the ICFTU expresses its concern over the police harassment of the Construction Workers' Trade Union (SINATRAC) since  January, which has paralysed that organisation's trade union activities. The ICFTU states that repression against workers is getting worse and is taking the form of beatings, detentions, bureaucratic obstacles in public institutions and ""visits"" to trade union premises without warrants. It also adds that on  October  Messrs. Nazario Valiente, Juan Manuel Villalba, Gerardo Mercedes Brites, Higinio Candia, Gilberto Domnguez and Basilio Pereira, members of the SINATRAC, were clubbed and threatened by members of the police force as they were leaving the union's premises.
.The ""visits"" to trade union premises in October and November  were carried out by police officers who proceeded to interrogate trade union officials about the operations, time and place of meetings and names of persons who had visited such premises. Moreover, a high-level official of the Police Investigation Department also visited trade union premises where meetings were being held by various union executive committees, and conducted interrogations without furnishing any explanation.
.In a telegram dated  January  the Government refers to the dismissal of workers of the ""Hoy"" publishing house, and in this connection states that the complainant has made tendentious allegations with a view to implicating the Government; in fact, the dismissal of these workers was the result of a managerial decision taken unilaterally by a private enterprise, which informed the Labour Directorate on  January  of its decision to terminate the employment contract of these workers. The Government's communication states that, to date, none of the workers concerned has appealed to the labour administration bodies to denounce his or her dismissal or any violation of freedom of association.
.In its communication of  September  the Government states that since  May , the Government has been headed by General Andrs Rodrguez, who was elected as constitutional President of the Republic of Paraguay. The arbitrary administrative actions carried out by the officials of the previous government reflect procedures, attitudes and events that belong to the past, a past which both the people and the Government of Paraguay hope never to see again. The Government assures the ILO that the new national Government guarantees the full freedom of the trade union movement, as well as its security, in accordance with the national Constitution, the Labour Code and the Conventions and Recommendations ratified by Paraguay.
.Specifically in connection with this case, the Government's communication states that no trade union leader is currently being detained, and that on the contrary, the trade unionists who are alleged to have been persecuted and detained by the previous regime, such as Marcelino Corazn Medina, enjoy their full freedom. This trade unionist, in particular, enjoys full freedom of action and expression as a leader of workers and peasants, and more recently, as a political activist in the Workers' Party, which has been recognised and registered in the Central Electoral Council.
.As regards the situation of doctors and nurses of the Clnicas Hospital, the Government states that their situation has been completely rectified. The reasons which led to their struggle with the previous regime have been given full consideration by the new Government, which ordered the complete restoration of the old building, and provided the hospital with all infrastructures necessary for its operations. In addition, it has met their demands for higher wages. To date, the Government adds, there is no discontent among the hospital's employees; they enjoy full freedom and guarantees in the exercise of their activities. The Government adds that, at the present time, all ""illegal"" restrictions imposed by the previous regime, such as detentions and torture, are being denounced and investigated by the courts on an individual basis and in accordance with the law. The complaints presented to the ILO concern events which took place during the previous regime, and the new Government has no responsibility in this connection. However, any cases brought before the competent authorities of the country which may affect trade unionists will be duly examined.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Sebastin Rodrguez, former General Secretary of the Bus Drivers' Union (Route No. ) of Fernando de la Mora, the Government states that the Labour Court ordered his reinstatement. Recently, the Labour Directorate, by means of Resolution No.  of  March , approved the registration of the new executive committee of the trade union headed by Mr. Sebastin Rodrguez.
.The Committee notes that the Government has sent some of the information requested by the Committee; it also notes that since  May  there is a new Government in Paraguay, which affirms its total commitment to freedom of association. However, the Committee wishes to point out that when examining allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights by one government, the Committee has indicated that there existed a link of continuity between successive governments of the same State, and that while a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a former government, it is clearly responsible for any continuing consequences which these events may have",0,1985,Paraguay
97,"had since its accession to power. Where a change of regime has taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which the events on which the complaint is based may have had since its accession to power, even though those events took place under its predecessor.
.The Committee notes that some of the outstanding allegations in this case relate to allegations of assaults by members of the pro-government party against doctors and nurses at the Clnicas Hospital, while they were treating persons who had been injured, apparently by law enforcement personnel, during the trade union demonstration held on  May . They also relate to the detention of trade union leaders Raquel Aquino in March , Marcelino Corazn Medina, Pedro Gamana, Carmelino Torales, Arcadio Flores and Teodoro Gonzlez on  May , Oscar Acosta, General Secretary of the Jounalists' and Radio Caritas Trade Union, Marina Arrn, trade union leader of the Royal Bank of Paraguay, and Elsa Merelas, President of the Asuncin Clnicas Hospital Workers' and Nurses' Association, on  December , and the arrest in December  of the following trade union leaders (mostly belonging to the MIT): Ronald Orrego, Edilberto Vargas, Gabriel Espnola, Celso Velzquez, Juan Galiano, Juanita Arracela and Teresa Godoy, who are being held in the prisons of the National Guard.
.In this connection the Committee takes note of information furnished by the Government to the effect that the situation of the doctors and nurses of the Clnicas Hospital has been completely rectified, and that at present, they enjoy full freedom and guarantees in the exercise of their activities. As regards the outstanding allegations concerning the detention of many trade unionists, the Committee notes that the Government states that no trade unionists are currently being held, and that trade unionists who are alleged to have been persecuted and detained by the former regime have been released unconditionally. It observes that the Government cites the specific case of trade union leader Marcelino Corazn Medina, who is active as a leader of workers and peasants, and a member of the Workers' Party. Nevertheless, the Committee requests the Government to furnish specific information on the release of trade unionists Raquel Aquino, Pedro Gamana, Carmelino Torales, Arcadio Flores, Toedoro Gonzlez, Oscar Acosta, Marina Arrn, Elsa Mereles, Ronald Orrego, Edilberto Vargas, Gabriel Espinola, Celso Velzquez, Juan Galiano, Juanita Arracela and Teresa Godoy.
.Moreover, the Committee notes that other outstanding allegations relate to the dismissal, for trade union reasons, of the trade union leader Sebastin Rodrguez in , and the dismissal in January  of the trade union leaders and delegates of the Asuncon Journalists' Trade Union, Eduardo Arce, Ramn Casco, Estela Rufenelli, Marit Ocampos, Teresa Godoy, Idilio Mndez and Hugo Villalba of the ""Hoy"" publishing house. Furthermore, the Committee takes note of information provided by the Government to the effect that the reinstatement of the trade union leader Sebastin Rodrguez has been ordered by the Labour Court, and that Resolution No.  of  March , issued by the Labour Directorate, provides for the registration of the new executive committee of the Bus Drivers' Union (Route No. ) of Fernando de la Mora. Likewise, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government according to which the trade union leaders and delegates of the Asuncin Journalists' Trade Union who were dismissed by the ""Hoy"" publishing house have not filed any proceedings for their reinstatement before the competent labour authorities. The Committee asks the Government to provide explanations on the procedures which exist to protect workers against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Another of the outstanding allegations refers to the acts of violence and death threats of  October  against Messrs. Nazario Valiente, Juan Manuel Villalba, Gerardo Mercedes Brites, Higinio Candia, Gilberto Domnguez and Basilio Pereira, members of the SINATRAC, as they were leaving their trade union's office. In this connection the Committee notes that the Government has failed to send specific observations on this point. The Committee wishes to point out that in the event of assaults on a person's physical or moral integrity, it considers that the government concerned should undertake an independent judicial investigation as soon as possible, since this represents an especially appropriate means for clarifying the facts, determining responsibility, punishing the guilty and preventing the repetition of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to state whether any judicial inquiry is in progress, and to specify the results of the same.
.As regards the allegations of surprise ""visits"", without warrants, by police officers and officials of the Department of Investigation to trade union premises during trade union meetings, the Committee can only deplore this attitude. It recalls that freedom from government interference in the proceedings of trade union meetings is an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of the right of assembly, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, unless the exercise of this right would threaten public order or endanger its maintenance (see th Report, Case No.  (Ecuador), para. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with interest that the Government affirms its commitment to respect for freedom of association. It recalls, nevertheless, that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments of the same State and that the Government is responsible for the consequences of events which took place prior to its accession to power.(b) As regards the allegations of assaults against the doctors and nurses at the Clnicas Hospital while they were treating persons who had been injured, apparently by law enforcement personnel, during the trade union demonstration held on  May , the Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government, to the effect that the situation of the doctors and nurses at the Clnicas Hospital has been completely rectified, and that they now enjoy full freedom and guarantees in the exercise of their activities.(c) As regards the alleged dismissal of trade union leaders, the Committee asks the Government to provide explanations on the procedures which exist to protect workers against acts of anti-union discrimination.(d) As regards the numerous detentions of trade union leaders (namely Raquel Aquino, Pedro Gamana, Carmelino Torales, Arcadio Flores, Teodoro Gonzlez, Oscar Acosta, Marina Arrn, Elsa Mereles, Ronald Orrego, Edilberto Vargas, Gabriel Espnola, Celso Valzquez, Juan Galiano, Juanita Arracela and Teresa Godoy), the Committee, while noting the Government's statements to the effect that no trade unionists are currently being detained, requests the Government to supply specific information on the release of the above-mentioned trade unionists.(e) As regards the allegations concerning acts of violence and death threats of  October  against Messrs. Mazario Valiente, Juan Manuel Villalba, Gerardo Mercedes Brites, Higinio Candia, Gilberto Domnquez and Basilio Pereira of the Construction Workers' Trade Union, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent specific observations on this matter. The Committee considers that in the event of assaults on the physical or moral integrity of individuals, as in the present case, the government concerned should immediately institute an independent judicial inquiry with a view to clarifying the facts, determining responsibility, punishing those responsible and preventing the repetition of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to state whether any judicial inquiry has been instituted, and to specify the outcome of the same.(f) As regards the allegations of surprise ""visits"", without warrants, by the police and officials of the Department of Investigation to trade union premises during trade union meetings, the Committee can only deplore this attitude and recall that freedom from government interference in the proceedings of trade union meetings is an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of the right of assembly; the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, unless the exercise of this right would disturb the peace or pose a serious or imminent threat to its maintenance.
.The Committee has already examined this case on three occasions, thelast being at its February  meeting, when it presented an interim report.(See th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its thSession.) Since then the Government transmitted certain information andobservations in a communication dated  April , received in the ILO only
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of theRight to Organise Convention,  (No ), and the Right to Organise andCollective Bargaining Convention,  (No ).
.The Committee takes note of all the information and observationsfurnished by the Government on some of the allegations still outstanding inthis case.
.The Committee nevertheless observes that the Government has notcommented in detail on several serious allegations made against it by thecomplainants, especially concerning the incidents said to have taken place atthe Clinicas Hospital on  May , that it has not denied that some membersof the Colorado party, on hospital premises, struck doctors and nurses whowere tending patients injured by the forces of order when a trade uniondemonstration was repressed; moreover,",0,1985,Paraguay
98,"the Government has furnished noinformation on the allegation concerning the arrest in March  of RaquelAquino, a secondary-school students' leader, said to have been detained in thePastor prison for having expressed her solidarity with the trade unionmovement.
.Finally the Government has not commented in detail on the ICFTU'sallegations dated  May  that several agricultural workers' leaders(whose names are given), including Marcelino Corazn, were again arrested in
.As regards the points on which the Government has supplied detailedreplies, the Committee observes, firstly, concerning the agricultural workers'leader Marcelino Corazn Medina, that the Government recognises that he wasprosecuted in  and  for infringing Act No.  concerning the defenceof public peace and individual freedom but has not supplied information on theactual offences he is said to have committed. The Government merely statesthat this person is a notorious agitator who tries to pass himself off as atrade unionist in a fictitious trade union organisation.
.In a number of cases where the complainants alleged that workers ortrade union leaders had been arrested for trade union activities, and thegovernment replies amounted to general denials or were simply to the effectthat the arrests were made on the grounds of subversive activites, for reasonsof internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has followed therule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further andas precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly inconnection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a resultthereof and the result of such proceedings, in order to be able to make aproper examination of the allegations. (See Digest of decisions and principlesof the Freedom of Association Committee of the Governing Body of the ILO,para. .)
.In the present case, since Act No.  concerning the defence of publicpeace and individual freedom permits the imposition of prison sentences foroffences based on one's opinion, and in view of the fact that, according tothe ICFTU's allegations, the agricultural workers' leader Marcelino CoraznMedina and four of his companions were again arrested on  May , theCommittee requests the Government to supply detailed information on the actualcharges brought against these leaders, to communicate the court judgements inthe case with the grounds adduced therefore, if they have been sentenced, andto state if they have now been released.
.The Committee observes, secondly, that the Government has not commentedin detail on the allegation that Mr. Sebastin Rodrguez, former GeneralSecretary of the Bus Drivers' Union (Route No. ) was arrested in , buthas confined itself to stating that this person is not detained, that he isnot employed in the undertaking and that he no longer belongs to the union.The Government does, however, acknowledge the fact that he was dismissed andhas appealed against his dismissal to the courts.
.The Committee recalls, in general, that no person should bediscriminated against in his employment because of his trade union membershipor lawful trade union activities and that appropriate measures should beadopted to guarantee the free exercise of trade union rights, accompanied bymeasures for the protection of workers against acts of anti-uniondiscrimination in their employment.
.Since the Government states that this person was dismissed and hasappealed against his dismissal to the courts, the Committee requests theGovernment to keep it informed of the outcome of this appeal.
.Concerning the strike which took place at the Clinicas Hospital, theCommittee notes the Government's statement that the workers in this hospitalare only public employees who do not enjoy the right to organise and itsexplanation that these persons had asked for pay increases in the course ofpublic demonstrations, thus contravening Act No.  in respect of the publicservice instead of availing themselves of the citizens' right of petition.
.The Committee considers that this aspect of the case raises twoquestions: firstly that of the right to organise of public employees. On thispoint, the Committee recalls that in accordance with Convention No. ratified by Paraguay, public employees, like any other workers, should havethe right to organise for trade union purposes (Article  of the Convention).Moreover, according to Convention No. , only public servants engaged in theadministration of the State can be excluded from the right to negotiateconditions of employment collectively (Article  of the Convention). Theemployees of a public hospital, namely the doctors and nurses working there,cannot be considered to be ""public servants engaged in the administration ofthe State"".
.Consequently, the Committee - as has the Committee of Experts on theApplication of Conventions and Recommendations - once again requests theGovernment to ensure the amendment of its legislation, especially Act No. respecting the public service (sections  and ) which allows publicemployees the right to associate only for cultural and social purposes andforbids them to adopt collective resolutions against measures taken by thecompetent authorities. The Committee invites the Government to adopt specificprovisions granting the right to organise to public employees and to set upmachinery for settling collective disputes in the public service in generaland in the hospital sector in particular in which the persons concerned willhave confidence.
.Secondly, there is the question of the right of the employees of apublic hospital to go on strike. In this respect the Committee observes,according to the allegations, that the persons concerned were prosecuted forhaving resorted to a strike to secure pay increases while they were carryingout their duties in a public hospital. The Committee has already had theoccasion to state that the right to strike may indeed be restricted or evenprohibited in the public service (public employees being those who act asagents of the public authorities) or in essential services in the strict senseof the term (i.e. services whose interruption would endanger the life,personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). In previouscases the Committee has considered the hospital sector to constitute anessential service. (See th Report, Case No.  (India), para. , andCase No.  (Norway), para. .)
.Nevertheless, the Committee has stated on many occasions that where theright to strike has been restricted or refused in a service considered to beessential, workers in this service should enjoy adequate protection so as tocompensate for the restrictions imposed on their freedom of action as regardsdisputes in the said service. In this particular case, the restriction of theright to strike of doctors and nurses in the Clinicas Hospital should beoffset by appropriate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitrationprocedures in which the persons concerned can take part at every stage and inwhich the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented, as theCommittee had the occasion to state in a previous case. (See th Report,Case No.  (Japan), para. .)
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invitesthe Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes with interest that the Government has replied tocertain allegations, but regrets that it has as yet supplied no observationson several of the serious allegations made against it by the complainants.b) Consequently, on the factual issues, the Committee once again requeststhe Government to state whether it is correct that members of thepro-Government party assaulted doctors and nurses on hospital premises whowere treating persons injured by the forces of order when a trade uniondemonstration was repressed on  May , as affirmed by the ICFTU in acommunication of  May , and if so to state whether a judicial inquiry hasbeen instituted following this repression to determine who is responsible.c) The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the ICFTU'sallegations dated  April  and  May  respectively concerning theimprisonment in March  of Raquel Aquino, a leader of secondary-schoolstudents, in the Pastor prison and the arrest, on  May , of agriculturalworker's leaders Marcelino Corazn Medina, Pedro Gamana, Carmelino Torales,Acadio Flores and Teodoro Gonzlez. In particular, it requests the Governmentto state precisely on what grounds they were imprisoned, to furnish the textof the court judgements concerning them if they have been tried, and tospecify whether these persons have since been released.d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the outcomeof the appeal against dismissal lodged by the trade union leader SebastinRodrguez, former General Secretary of the Bus Drivers' Union (route No. )who is said to have been dismissed in  for trade union reasons.e) On the legal issues, as regards the denial to public employees of theright to organise in trade unions and the restrictions on their freedom tonegotiate their conditions of employment collectively, the Committee requeststhe Government to ensure the amendment of Act No.  in respect of the publicservice (sections  and ) so as to include specific legislative provisionson the right to organise of public employees and to introduce machinery forthe settlement of collective disputes in the public service in which thepersons concerned will have confidence.f) As regards the ban on strikes by doctors and nurses employed in a publichospital, the Committee requests the Government to ensure the adoption ofspecific provisions to compensate, by introducing appropriate conciliation andarbitration procedures, for the fact that there is no right to strike in thisessential service.g) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on theApplication of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects ofthis case regarding Conventions Nos.  and .
.The Committee has already examined this case",-1,1985,Paraguay
99,"on two occasions, most recently at its May  meeting, when it submitted interim conclusions. (See st Report, paras. -.) Due to the lack of a reply from the Government to its repeated requests, the Committee at its November  meeting addressed an urgent appeal to it for its observations. The Committee also recalled that, in accordance with the procedural rule set out in paragraph  of its th Report, in accordance with the procedural rule set out in , it would present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting even if the Government's observations had not been received in time. (See para.  of the rd Report.) Subsequently, in a communication dated  October , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has presented new allegations. The Government has supplied neither observations nor comments.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The outstanding allegations in this case relate to the detention of trade union activists and leaders who are named by the complainants, to the violent repression of peaceful trade union demonstrations and to various acts of interference with and pressure exerted against trade union organisations and their leaders.
.In particular the complainants referred to the climate of violence and repression affecting the trade union movement during  and  in the hospitals, press, teaching and agricultural sectors.
.They referred to the questioning of doctors during a strike which took place on  April  at the Jos Bellasa Hospital, to the ban on May Day celebrations in , to the subsequent violent repression and to the fact that a large number of persons were injured by the forces of order and taken to hospital, to the attacks perpetrated on  May by some  militants of the Colorado party who were authorised to enter the hospital premises and who are said to have struck doctors and nurses who were attending the injured, to the destruction of the anduti radio station by the same group on the grounds that this radio supported the workers and their organisations during the trade union demonstrations. The complainants subsequently stated that the doctors who had been arrested during the strike were released for lack of evidence of their having committed an offence.
.Furthermore the complainants described the attack by the police on the headquarters of the Federation of Bank Employees (FETRABAN) in April  and again in March , and the detention for a number of days in March  of the General Secretary of the Workers' Inter-Trade Union Movement (MIT), Mr. Victor Baez, during a meeting of his organisation. Mr. Baez was subsequently released.
.The complainants also alleged that in March  Raquel Aquino, leader of secondary-school students, was arrested for having expressed her solidarity with the trade union movement. In addition, a leader of the MIT was obliged to give up her job as philosophy teacher at the National Ladies' College and was not allowed to protest this.
.Lastly, the complainants denounced the arrest in  at Ononnondivepa of the rural trade union leaders Marcelino Corazn, Medina and Bernardo Tonales and the General Secretary of the Paraguay Cotton Company Workers' Trade Union (CAPSA) the day before the union's general assembly.
.In view of the seriousness of the allegations to which the Government had not replied, the Committee, at its May  meeting, expressed its serious concern at the large number of arrests of trade union leaders and members. It deplored the fact that the Government had replied in respect of only a few of the allegations made against it and urged the Government to reply concerning all of the serious allegations presented by the complainant organisations.
.Since then the Government has supplied no reply to the Committee's requests.
.In a communication dated  October , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions stated that on  October  the police used violence to prevent the holding of a union meeting of the National Union of Construction Workers, violently charging and injuring a large number of them who were transported urgently to assistance centres.
.Before examining the substance of this case, the Committee regrets having to draw the Government's attention to the considerations it set out in its First Report (para. ), namely that the purpose of the whole procedure that has been instituted is to ensure respect for trade union rights in law and in fact and that the Committee is convinced that while the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them.
.In these circumstances, the Committee once again deplores the fact that the Government has not replied to the serious allegations made by the complainants, some presented as far back as two years ago, and that because of the time which has elapsed, the Committee is obliged to examine the case without being able to take the Government's observations or comments into account.
.The Committee notes that the allegations in this case relate essentially to the arrest of trade unionists, the ban on May Day celebrations and the occupation of trade union premises to prevent the holding of union meetings.
.Since the Government has not denied these allegations, the Committee can only conclude that the principles of freedom of association have been seriously infringed in these various incidents.
.As regards the arrest of trade unionists whose names were supplied by the complainants, the Committee recalls that measures of preventive detention imply serious interference by the Government in trade union activities which can give rise to criticism unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period of time. Furthermore the Committee recalls that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no charge is made involves restrictions on freedom of association. Consequently the Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned are given appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies. (See th Report, Case No.  (India), para. , and Case No.  (Japan), para. .)
.As regards the ban on the celebration of May Day and the acts of violence perpetrated by political groups against workers, including doctors on hospital premises where injured people were being treated, the Committee expresses its very deep concern with regard to such allegations. Since the Government has not refuted them, the Committee must insist on the importance of the principle according to which the right to organise public meetings and processions on the occasion of May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights. (See in particular th Report, Case No.  (Turkey), para. ). Furthermore the Committee strongly condemns the acts of violence said to have been perpetrated on hospital premises against doctors who were treating the injured persons taken there after the confrontations on May Day.
.As regards the attacks on trade union premises and the arrest of trade union leaders before the holding of union meetings, the Committee notes once again that the Government has not denied these allegations. It recalls that the arrest of trade union leaders with the aim of preventing the holding of a union meeting constitutes a serious violation of the exercise of trade union rights. (See th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee strongly regrets that the Government has not replied to the repeated requests for information made to it. It expresses its serious concern at the allegations concerning repression of the trade union movement in  and  and, in particular, the arrest of trade union activists and leaders, whose names have been supplied by the complainants, the ban on peaceful trade union demonstrations on May Day which were violently put down, and the interference in the affairs of trade union organisations and pressure brought to bear on them and on union members.b) The Committee recalls that a free and independent trade union movement cannot develop in an atmosphere of insecurity and fear.c) The Committee urges the Government to take measures to ensure that the authorities concerned are given appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger for trade union activities represented by such measures as the arrest of trade unionists, the banning of trade union demonstrations on May Day and of the holding of trade union meetings.d) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee respect for freedom of association in law and in fact, in accordance with the obligations arising from Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Paraguay, and to keep it informed of these measures in particular to state whether judicial inquiries have been undertaken following the repression which took place on hospital premises on  May , in order to determine who is responsible and to punish the guilty parties.
.The Committee examined this case at its November ",0,1985,Paraguay
100,"meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )).
.Following the examination of this case in November , new allegations were received in communications from the following organisations: the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( December ;  April,  May,  October and  December ; , , and  March and  April ); the Latin American Central of Workers ( May and  November ); and the Workers' Inter-trade Union Movement - Paraguay ( March ).
.The Government sent certain observations in communications dated  June  and  February .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case (November ), the Committee noted that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina (Chairman of the Committee of Agricultural Producers) had been released, and requested the Government to send its observations on the alleged torture of this trade union leader during his detention in September , and to indicate the concrete facts on which his detention was based, as well as observations on the alleged detention of Mr. Sebastin Rodrguez, General Secretary of the Drivers' Union of Line , who according to the ICFTU, was still imprisoned in October  after more than  days, for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues (see st Report, paras.  and ).
.In its communication of  May , the ICFTU adds that on  May the MIT had called for a peaceful public demonstration, but that the workers wishing to attend the meeting were violently turned back by the police. The ICFTU states that on  May some  militants of the Partido Colorado (in the Government) assaulted the physicians and nurses permitted to tend to the wounded; this group, whose access to the hospital was authorised by the police, proceeded to destroy hospital installations. Later, the same group totally destroyed the facilities of Radio andut (which had allowed workers and their organisations to voice their opinions). These events took place in the presence of the police, who failed to intervene. The ICFTU also requests the unconditional release of the agricultural trade union leader Marcelino Corazn Medina (arrested during the May Day demonstration).
.The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) refers to some of the allegations presented by the ICFTU, adding that the judicial authorities, having found no evidence of criminal responsibility, released the doctors who had been arrested during the hospital workers' demonstration of  April  (which had been violently repressed). It also points out that the police repression of the May Day commemoration resulted in a large number of injured persons.
.In its communications of  October and  December , the ICFTU alleges that Herminia Feliciangeli and Benjamn Livieres of the Commerce Trade Union and the Journalists' Trade Union, respectively, were arrested on  October. The ICFTU also reports the arrest of Sonia Aquino, a leader of the Journalists' Trade Union, who has disappeared and states that fears are held for her life. On  November Carlos Filizzola, a doctor and a leader of the Hospital Trade Union, was arrested in front of his house. In its communication of  November , the CLAT states that the above-mentioned Herminia Feliciangeli and Benjamn Livieres were charged with participating in public demonstrations and trade union activities, such as distributing information in the workplace; they have been tried pursuant to Act No.  on ""defence of the public order and the freedom of persons"".
.In its communication of  March , the Workers' Inter-trade Union Movement (MIT) alleges that Margarita Capurro de Seiferheld, a leader of the MIT, has been told to resign from her position as philosophy teacher at the National Girls' School, or otherwise face summary administrative proceedings filed by the Ministry of Education and Culture; she was further warned not to contest the charges, since she lives alone and has a daughter whom no one would care for in her absence.
.In its communication of  March , the ICFTU alleges that Vctor Bez, General Secretary of the MIT and the FETRABAN, was violently arrested by the police on  March, after the headquarters of the FETRABAN had been surrounded by the police for several hours during the course of a meeting of the MIT leaders. In a subsequent communication of  March , the ICFTU reports that Vctor Bez was released on  March .
.In its communication of  April , the ICFTU alleges that Pedro Salcedo, General Secretary of the Paraguay Cotton Company Workers' Trade Union (CAPSA), was arrested the day before the trade union's general assembly. The police prevented this meeting from taking place by roping off the premises and arresting workers as they arrived, although they were later released. The ICFTU adds that the agricultural trade union leaders Marcelino Corazn Medina and Bernardo Tonales were arrested in Ononondivepa while engaged in trade union activities. Lastly, the ICFTU states that Raquel Aquino, a leader of secondary school students, has been arrested since mid-March for sympathising with the trade union movement.
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that Marcelino Corazn Medina was released on  June .
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Benjamn Livieres and Herminia Feliciangeli, the Government states in its communication of  February  that these persons have been released and are free to carry out their activities without any restriction what so ever. They had been tried by the courts on the grounds indicated in the court's proceedings (the Government states that it has sent photocopies of the relevant court documents but these have not been received by the ILO). The Government adds that Mr. Filizzola is currently free, that he was not arrested or detained without contact as alleged by the complainants, but was detained in accordance with court orders based on the procedure in force (the Government states that it has sent photocopies of the relevant court documents, but these have not been received by the ILO).
.In the first place, the Committee expresses its serious concern at the high number of arrests of trade union members and leaders, identified by name, and at the nature of the other allegations relating to the violent repression of peaceful trade union demonstrations, and to the various acts of interference with and violence and pressure against trade union organisations and their leaders. The Committee deplores the fact that the Government has replied only to a limited number of these allegations, despite the time that has elapsed since they were made.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leaders Benjamn Livieres, Herminia Feliciangeli and Carlos Filizzola were released after the relevant court proceedings were instituted. The Committee observes that the Government states that it has sent copies of the pertinent court documents, but these have not been received by the ILO. The Committee likewise notes that the complainants have reported the release of the doctor trade unionists Jos Bellasai, Ursino Barrios, Anbal Carrillo and Juan Masi, as well as that of Vctor Bez, General Secretary of the MIT-P. In these circumstances, since it appears that no charges have been held against these individuals, the Committee must express its serious concern over these arrests, and draws the Government's attention to the principle that measures designed to deprive trade union leaders and members of their freedom, entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that such measures, when based on trade union reasons, constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association. (See for example, rd Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. .)
.Lastly, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the agricultural trade union leader Marcelino Corazn Medina was released on  June . The Committee notes, however, that according to the allegations, Mr. Corazn Medina was again arrested on  May  and then again in April , and that the Government has not sent its comments in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee expresses its serious concern at the large number of arrests of trade union members and leaders.b) The Committee deplores the fact that the Government has replied only to a limited number of allegations, despite the time that has elapsed since they were submitted, and urges the Government to send its observations on all of the serious allegations presented by the complainants concerning the arrest of trade union leaders, the violent repression of peaceful trade union demonstrations and the various acts of interference with, violence and pressure against trade union organisations and their leaders.c) In view of the conclusions concerning the arrest of certain trade union leaders, the Committee requests the Government henceforth to keep it in mind that measures designed to deprive trade union leaders and",0,1985,Paraguay
101,"members of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in union activities and that such measures, when based on trade union reasons, constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented the complaints corresponding to Cases Nos.  (communications dated  and  May and  and  October ),  (communication dated  April ),  (communications dated  and  September ), and  (communication dated  June ). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No.  in a communication dated  April .
.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).
.The Government representative at the st Session of the International Labour Conference (June ) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. ,  and .
.At the st Session (Geneva, ) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos.  and  (both ratified by Paraguay).
.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated  June  to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from  to  September  in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on  September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE). The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively  and  October , presented new allegations in connection with Case No. . These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated  October , the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about  days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line ) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  October  in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.
.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.
.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.
.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  September  in Paraguay. The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos.  and .
.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October ), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).
.As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality, the Committee observes that in  the Labour Directorate notified the trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance such as the existence of another association for the same purposes. The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government's position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since  for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.
.As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the ""Amrica Textil"" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the contents of the allegations and the Government's statements. While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting  workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Amrica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.
.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no undertaking called ""FRISA",-1,1985,Paraguay
102,"S.A."" and that Radio anduti was closed down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for political reasons.
.The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour Appeals Court, by decision of  December , decided in favour of the claims of the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil on the matters in dispute regarding the renewal of the collective agreement.
.As regards the dismissal of trade unionists Duarte, Virgili and Cceres, the Committee notes the information provided in the report of the representative of the Director-General. In view of the fact that this case is pending judgement in court, the Committee adjourns examination of this matter until judgement is pronounced and requests the Government to transmit a copy of the judgement as soon as it is handed down.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organisation has alleged that, between  August and  September , Melanio Morel, Gregorio Ojeda, Pedro Zrate, Carlos Castillo and Nicasio Guzmn, all of whom are trade union leaders or trade unionists belonging to the National Union of Construction Workers (SINATRAC) were detained while setting up a trade union in the ACEPAR iron and steel plant. The Committee also observes that three of these persons met with the representative of the Director-General and stated the following: () they had intended to set up a works committee in the undertaking which was building the ACEPAR plant; () on  August , as they were preparing for an assembly which they had called at the bus stop near the ACEPAR plant, and after they had been warned by the police that they should not hold the assembly, they were detained by members of the armed forces; and () they had not been brought to trial.
.The Committee notes that, according to the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour with whom the representative of the Director-General met, ACEPAR is a semi-public undertaking located in the military zone and run by military personnel. Moreover, according to the ministry authorities, the assembly which had been called was unauthorised and therefore could not be held. The organisers of the assembly had consequently been detained by the armed forces. They were later released without having been brought to trial.
.Although the Committee considers the fact that the legislation of a country, in order to prevent disruption of the public order, requires administrative authorisation for the organisation of meetings in public places does not run counter to the principles of freedom of association, it wishes to draw attention to the fact that given the absence of criminal acts in the present case, the mere fact of having organised a trade union assembly should not have resulted in the detention of the trade union leaders and trade unionists involved. Therefore, the Committee regrets the detention of these trade union leaders and trade unionists and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ). Furthermore, in view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than  days, and that none of the trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee would emphasise the principle that any person who is detained should immediately be brought before the competent court.
.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the detainees themselves, they were not dismissed, as they do not work in an employment relationship but as a crew engaged under a contract for services, although since being detained they have been unable to obtain contracts with building enterprises, only with individuals. The Committee also notes that, according to the authorities, the persons concerned do not appear to be actually working in the construction industry.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organisation mainly objects to the recognition by the Ministry of Labour on  October  of the executive committee elected at an assembly to reorganise the National Union of Construction Workers (SINATRAC), held on  October  and led by the Secretary-General of that organisation, Milciades Gimnez Daz, a supporter of government policy.
.The Committee also observes that, some months earlier, on  March , a split occurred in the executive committee of SINATRAC, dividing it into two different factions: one headed by Milciades Gimnez Daz, Secretary-General of SINATRAC, and the other by Lino Gmez, Deputy Secretary-General of SINATRAC. Each faction organised an assembly to elect a new executive committee, as the term of office of the existing committee was due to expire on  October . Thus, the faction led by Milciades Gimnez Daz called an assembly on  October , while the faction led by Lino Gmez called another for  October , although the latter was postponed by the police and was held on  October .
.On  October , as stated, the Government recognised the executive committee elected at the assembly of  October  led by Milciades Gimnez Daz. However, when it was informed of the executive committee elected on  October  at the assembly led by Lino Gmez, the competent authority of the Ministry of Justice and Labour notified Lino Gmez on  November  of the text of a decision of the legal consultant's office stating that recognition could not be granted since ""by Resolution No.  dated  October of the current year the Labour Directorate registered the National Union of Construction Workers, whose executive committee is currently in office, and its term of office is due to expire in  according to its statutes"". A subsequent decision issued by the legal consultant's office, notified by the Director of Labour on  February , stated that an appeal could be lodged through the administrative disputes procedure.
.The Committee concludes that the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, aware of the existence of two assemblies to elect a new executive committee, appear to have based their recognition of one of the committees on considerations of time alone, that is, on the fact that the executive committee elected at the assembly led by Milciades Gimnez Daz was the first to apply for recognition. The Committee observes that the competent authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, referring to the allegations, told the representative of the Director-General that the situation was sometimes confusing, in the general context of the internal disagreement among the members of the executive committee of SINATRAC. According to the ministry authorities, once Lino Gmez had been informed of the decision to recognise the executive committee elected on  October , he could have lodged an administrative appeal against that decision.
.The Committee considers that, irrespective of whether such an appeal was possible (which Lino Gmez's group denies), the decision of  October  of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the executive committee elected by the assembly of  October  constitutes a decision that was arbitrary and taken in too great haste. The Ministry was fully aware that another duly convened assembly was to be held a few days later (on  October) for the same purpose. The Committee would like to point out that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation they should be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.
.The Committee observes that the representative of the Director-General was able to note the police surveillance and shadowing to which Ricardo Esperanza Leiva, former leader of the Liebig Refrigeration Union and leader of the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE), is being subjected. The Committee requests the Government to alter what it calls the methods of protecting the life and safety of Mr. Leiva so that, if considered objectively, there can be no confusion with police surveillance.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged torture of this trade union leader indicating what were the concrete facts leading to his detention, as well as on the alleged detention of Sebastin Rodrguez, Secretary-General of the Drivers' Union of Line .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:The Committee notes that a direct contacts mission visited the country from  to  September .Case No. (a) The Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(b) In view of the fact that, according to the Government, there is no reason from the legal standpoint why the Union of Journalists of Paraguay should not be set up, the Committee hopes that this union will apply for and be granted legal personality",-1,1985,Paraguay

The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No.  in a communication dated  April .
.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).
.The Government representative at the st Session of the International Labour Conference (June ) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. ,  and .
.At the st Session (Geneva, ) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos.  and  (both ratified by Paraguay).
.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated  June  to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from  to  September  in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on  September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE). The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively  and  October , presented new allegations in connection with Case No. . These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated  October , the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about  days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line ) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  October  in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.
.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.
.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.

He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated  October , the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about  days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line ) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  October  in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.
.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.
.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.
.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  September  in Paraguay. The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos.  and .
.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October ), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).
.As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality, the Committee observes that in  the Labour Directorate notified the trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance such as the existence of another association for the same purposes. The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government's position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since  for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.
.As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the ""Amrica Textil"" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the contents of the allegations and the Government's statements. While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting  workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Amrica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.
.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no undertaking called ""FRISA S.A."" and that Radio anduti was closed down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for political reasons.
.The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour Appeals",-1,1984,Paraguay
108,"Court, by decision of  December , decided in favour of the claims of the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil on the matters in dispute regarding the renewal of the collective agreement.
.As regards the dismissal of trade unionists Duarte, Virgili and Cceres, the Committee notes the information provided in the report of the representative of the Director-General. In view of the fact that this case is pending judgement in court, the Committee adjourns examination of this matter until judgement is pronounced and requests the Government to transmit a copy of the judgement as soon as it is handed down.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organisation has alleged that, between  August and  September , Melanio Morel, Gregorio Ojeda, Pedro Zrate, Carlos Castillo and Nicasio Guzmn, all of whom are trade union leaders or trade unionists belonging to the National Union of Construction Workers (SINATRAC) were detained while setting up a trade union in the ACEPAR iron and steel plant. The Committee also observes that three of these persons met with the representative of the Director-General and stated the following: () they had intended to set up a works committee in the undertaking which was building the ACEPAR plant; () on  August , as they were preparing for an assembly which they had called at the bus stop near the ACEPAR plant, and after they had been warned by the police that they should not hold the assembly, they were detained by members of the armed forces; and () they had not been brought to trial.
.The Committee notes that, according to the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour with whom the representative of the Director-General met, ACEPAR is a semi-public undertaking located in the military zone and run by military personnel. Moreover, according to the ministry authorities, the assembly which had been called was unauthorised and therefore could not be held. The organisers of the assembly had consequently been detained by the armed forces. They were later released without having been brought to trial.
.Although the Committee considers the fact that the legislation of a country, in order to prevent disruption of the public order, requires administrative authorisation for the organisation of meetings in public places does not run counter to the principles of freedom of association, it wishes to draw attention to the fact that given the absence of criminal acts in the present case, the mere fact of having organised a trade union assembly should not have resulted in the detention of the trade union leaders and trade unionists involved. Therefore, the Committee regrets the detention of these trade union leaders and trade unionists and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ). Furthermore, in view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than  days, and that none of the trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee would emphasise the principle that any person who is detained should immediately be brought before the competent court.
.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the detainees themselves, they were not dismissed, as they do not work in an employment relationship but as a crew engaged under a contract for services, although since being detained they have been unable to obtain contracts with building enterprises, only with individuals. The Committee also notes that, according to the authorities, the persons concerned do not appear to be actually working in the construction industry.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organisation mainly objects to the recognition by the Ministry of Labour on  October  of the executive committee elected at an assembly to reorganise the National Union of Construction Workers (SINATRAC), held on  October  and led by the Secretary-General of that organisation, Milciades Gimnez Daz, a supporter of government policy.
.The Committee also observes that, some months earlier, on  March , a split occurred in the executive committee of SINATRAC, dividing it into two different factions: one headed by Milciades Gimnez Daz, Secretary-General of SINATRAC, and the other by Lino Gmez, Deputy Secretary-General of SINATRAC. Each faction organised an assembly to elect a new executive committee, as the term of office of the existing committee was due to expire on  October . Thus, the faction led by Milciades Gimnez Daz called an assembly on  October , while the faction led by Lino Gmez called another for  October , although the latter was postponed by the police and was held on  October .
.On  October , as stated, the Government recognised the executive committee elected at the assembly of  October  led by Milciades Gimnez Daz. However, when it was informed of the executive committee elected on  October  at the assembly led by Lino Gmez, the competent authority of the Ministry of Justice and Labour notified Lino Gmez on  November  of the text of a decision of the legal consultant's office stating that recognition could not be granted since ""by Resolution No.  dated  October of the current year the Labour Directorate registered the National Union of Construction Workers, whose executive committee is currently in office, and its term of office is due to expire in  according to its statutes"". A subsequent decision issued by the legal consultant's office, notified by the Director of Labour on  February , stated that an appeal could be lodged through the administrative disputes procedure.
.The Committee concludes that the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, aware of the existence of two assemblies to elect a new executive committee, appear to have based their recognition of one of the committees on considerations of time alone, that is, on the fact that the executive committee elected at the assembly led by Milciades Gimnez Daz was the first to apply for recognition. The Committee observes that the competent authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, referring to the allegations, told the representative of the Director-General that the situation was sometimes confusing, in the general context of the internal disagreement among the members of the executive committee of SINATRAC. According to the ministry authorities, once Lino Gmez had been informed of the decision to recognise the executive committee elected on  October , he could have lodged an administrative appeal against that decision.
.The Committee considers that, irrespective of whether such an appeal was possible (which Lino Gmez's group denies), the decision of  October  of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the executive committee elected by the assembly of  October  constitutes a decision that was arbitrary and taken in too great haste. The Ministry was fully aware that another duly convened assembly was to be held a few days later (on  October) for the same purpose. The Committee would like to point out that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation they should be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.
.The Committee observes that the representative of the Director-General was able to note the police surveillance and shadowing to which Ricardo Esperanza Leiva, former leader of the Liebig Refrigeration Union and leader of the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE), is being subjected. The Committee requests the Government to alter what it calls the methods of protecting the life and safety of Mr. Leiva so that, if considered objectively, there can be no confusion with police surveillance.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged torture of this trade union leader indicating what were the concrete facts leading to his detention, as well as on the alleged detention of Sebastin Rodrguez, Secretary-General of the Drivers' Union of Line .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:The Committee notes that a direct contacts mission visited the country from  to  September .Case No. (a) The Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(b) In view of the fact that, according to the Government, there is no reason from the legal standpoint why the Union of Journalists of Paraguay should not be set up, the Committee hopes that this union will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future.(c) The Committee draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.Case",-1,1984,Paraguay

110,".The Committee examined Case No.  at its meetings of November  and November  (see th Report, paras.  to , and st Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th and st Sessions (November  and November )).
.The complaint in Case No.  is contained in a communication from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the World Federation of Industrial Workers (WFIW), dated  April . The Government replied in a communication of  October .
.At its February  meeting, the Committee noted that the Government had not supplied full information concerning all of the pending allegations, in spite of the time elapsed since the last examination of Case No. , and since the presentation of allegations in Case No. ; the Committee accordingly informed the Government that it would submit a report on the substance of the cases at its next meeting in accordance with its procedure (th Report, para. ), even if the observations requested from the Government had not been received.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) Noting that the legislation does not give adequate protection against actions of anti-trade union discrimination, the Committee draws the legislative aspect of the cases to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, and requests the Government to take measures with a view to adopting legislative provisions which effectively protect trade unionists and workers against dismissals based on trade union activities.b) The Committee requests the Government to respect in the future, the principles outlined in the foregoing paragraphs concerning trade union autonomy in the drafting of trade union by-laws and in the election of executive boards, and non-interference in trade union meetings, and to take measures to remove the requirement for administrative authorisation to hold trade union meetings.
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented the complaints corresponding to Cases Nos.  (communications dated  and  May and  and  October ),  (communication dated  April ),  (communications dated  and  September ), and  (communication dated  June ). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No.  in a communication dated  April .
.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).
.The Government representative at the st Session of the International Labour Conference (June ) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. ,  and .
.At the st Session (Geneva, ) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos.  and  (both ratified by Paraguay).
.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated  June  to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from  to  September  in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on  September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE). The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.

.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively  and  October , presented new allegations in connection with Case No. . These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger.

The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged torture of this trade union leader stating what were the concrete facts leading to his detention, as well as on the detention of Sebastin Rodrguez, Secretary-General of the Drivers' Trade Union of Line .
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions dated  April . The Government replied in a communication of  September .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that during collective bargaining between the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil and the employer's representatives of the same bank, Rolando Duarte, Rodolfo Virgili and Guillermo Cceres, all members of the trade union in question, were unfairly dismissed.
.The complainant alleges that alongside these events,  members of the union were threatened with dismissal. Faced with this intimidation, the trade union tried by various legal channels to obtain a solution for those members who had been. dismissed or threatened with dismissal. As these attempts failed, the trade union organised a peaceful march of all its members to attract the attention of the general public and express its disapproval in front of the Brazilian Embassy. This march was prevented and violently put down by the police.
.The complainant also alleges that in spite of the union's repeated demands to the Standing Conciliation and Arbitration Board, the latter has still failed to bring about the renewel of the collective agreement which expired on  January .
.Finally, the complainant encloses a communication from the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil stating that the bank authorities had refused to talk with the trade union, using delaying tactics and thus blocking the way to a peaceful solution to the dispute; furthermore, the Bank had spread rumours to the effect that there was a list of  employees who were to be dismissed.
.The Government states that the Bank of Brazil had informed the Labour Directorate of the dismissal of Rolando Duarte, Adolfo Virgili and Guillermo Cceres, stating that they had been duly paid off. In view of this situation, the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil and the Paraguayan Federation of Bank Employees, representing their dismissed members, expressed their total' disagreement with the Bank's action. The Labour Directorate attempted to open the way for all possible discussions, acting within the field of competence conferred upon it by law, but, unfortunately, in spite of these good offices, the parties were unable to reach an agreement. Having thus exhausted all the channels offered them by the administrative labour authorities, those workers who considered that their rights had been infringed turned, in accordance with the law, to the Courts.
.The Government adds that there had been no further accusations against the Bank in question and that the latter had not taken any other measures affecting the trade union or any of its members. In any case, in any situation in which the interests of the working class are involved and especially when these are related to maintaining good relations between employers and workers, the national government takes it upon itself to ensure that the labour provisions in force are applied.
.The Government also states that before the dismissals took place, as a procedure was underway to clarify a provision related to one of the clauses contained in the existing collective labour agreement between the Bank of Brazil and the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil, the file was submitted to the Standing Conciliation and Arbitration Board for its consideration. After being examined by the Board, all the records of the case were submitted to the Labour Court, where this question is at present being discussed; it is up to the Court to rule in favour of one of the parties.
.Finally, the Government states that, alongside the legal proceedings carried out by the administrative authorities, the trade union organised peaceful marches with its members; it states that the union was able to carry out this type of action whenever it wished, in complete freedom, without any interference whatsoever from the authorities. The Government states that the allegation that these marches were prevented and violently put down by the police is totally unfounded and constitutes an absurd lie. The Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil used all the means at its disposal to express its concern about the decision taken against the workers in question by the Bank of Brazil.
.With respect to the alleged unfair dismissal of Rolando Duarte, Rodolfo Virgili and Guillermo Cceres, members of the Trade Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil, whilst the latter was in the process of collective bargaining, the Committee notes that in spite",0,1984,Paraguay
113,"of the Labour Directorate's good offices between the trade union and the bank, no agreement could be reached. The Committee also notes that having exhausted all channels with the administrative authorities, those concerned turned to the courts. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial appeal concerning the dismissal of Rolando Duarte, Rodolfo Virgili and Guillermo Cceres.
.With respect to the allegation that  members of the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil were threatened with dismissal, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this Bank had taken no measures against the members of the trade union. The Committee also notes that according to the documentation sent by the complainant, these threats were allegedly in the form of rumours circulated by the Bank. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.With respect to the allegation that the police had violently put down a peaceful demonstration in front of the Brazilian Embassy to protest against the dismissal of the three persons to whom reference has already been made, the Committee notes that the Government categorically denies these facts. In view of the contradiction of the complainant's allegations in the Government's reply, the Committee is not in a position to formulate-any conclusions on the matter.
.Finally, the Committee notes the Government's explanations concerning the delay of almost two years in renewing the collective labour agreement between the Bank of Brazil and the trade union. The Committee notes that the points of contention were first submitted to the Standing Conciliation and Arbitration Board and then to the Labour Court, which will rule in favour of one of the parties. In this respect, noting that the complainant stated that the authorities in the Bank of Brazil refused to talk with the trade union and used delaying tactics, on which the Government made no comment, the Committee can only express the hope that the Labour Court will shortly decide the points of contention concerning the collective agreement in question. It draws attention to the obligation on both employers and trade unions to bargain in good faith to come to an agreement and stresses that satisfactory labour relations depend primarily on the attitudes of the parties towards each other and on their mutual confidence [see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Japan) para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the decision taken by the Labour Court on this case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and, in particular the following conclusions.(a) The Committee expresses the hope that the Labour Court will shortly decide the points of contention in connection with the renewal of the collective agreement between the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil and this same bank, which expired on  January . It draws attention to the obligation on both employers and trade unions to bargain in good faith to reach an agreement and stresses that satisfactory labour relations depend primarily on the attitudes of the parties towards each other and on their mutual confidence. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the Labour Court's decision on this case.(b) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial appeal concerning the dismissal of Rolando Duarte, Adolfo Virgili and Guillermo Cceres, members of the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil.(c) The Committee is of the opinion that the remaining allegations do not call for further examination.",1,1984,Paraguay
114,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented the complaints corresponding to Cases Nos.  (communications dated  and  May and  and  October ),  (communication dated  April ),  (communications dated  and  September ), and  (communication dated  June ). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No.  in a communication dated  April .
.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).
.The Government representative at the st Session of the International Labour Conference (June ) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. ,  and .
.At the st Session (Geneva, ) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos.  and  (both ratified by Paraguay).
.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated  June  to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from  to  September  in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on  September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE). The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively  and  October , presented new allegations in connection with Case No. . These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated  October , the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about  days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line ) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  October  in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.
.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.
.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.
.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  September  in Paraguay. The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos.  and .
.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October ), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).
.As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality, the Committee observes that in  the Labour Directorate notified the trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance such as the existence of another association for the same purposes. The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government's position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since  for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.
.As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the ""Amrica Textil"" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the contents of the allegations and the Government's statements. While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting  workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Amrica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.
.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no undertaking called ""FRISA S.A."" and that Radio anduti was closed down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for political reasons.
.The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour Appeals",-1,1983,Paraguay
115,"Court, by decision of  December , decided in favour of the claims of the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil on the matters in dispute regarding the renewal of the collective agreement.
.As regards the dismissal of trade unionists Duarte, Virgili and Cceres, the Committee notes the information provided in the report of the representative of the Director-General. In view of the fact that this case is pending judgement in court, the Committee adjourns examination of this matter until judgement is pronounced and requests the Government to transmit a copy of the judgement as soon as it is handed down.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organisation has alleged that, between  August and  September , Melanio Morel, Gregorio Ojeda, Pedro Zrate, Carlos Castillo and Nicasio Guzmn, all of whom are trade union leaders or trade unionists belonging to the National Union of Construction Workers (SINATRAC) were detained while setting up a trade union in the ACEPAR iron and steel plant. The Committee also observes that three of these persons met with the representative of the Director-General and stated the following: () they had intended to set up a works committee in the undertaking which was building the ACEPAR plant; () on  August , as they were preparing for an assembly which they had called at the bus stop near the ACEPAR plant, and after they had been warned by the police that they should not hold the assembly, they were detained by members of the armed forces; and () they had not been brought to trial.
.The Committee notes that, according to the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour with whom the representative of the Director-General met, ACEPAR is a semi-public undertaking located in the military zone and run by military personnel. Moreover, according to the ministry authorities, the assembly which had been called was unauthorised and therefore could not be held. The organisers of the assembly had consequently been detained by the armed forces. They were later released without having been brought to trial.
.Although the Committee considers the fact that the legislation of a country, in order to prevent disruption of the public order, requires administrative authorisation for the organisation of meetings in public places does not run counter to the principles of freedom of association, it wishes to draw attention to the fact that given the absence of criminal acts in the present case, the mere fact of having organised a trade union assembly should not have resulted in the detention of the trade union leaders and trade unionists involved. Therefore, the Committee regrets the detention of these trade union leaders and trade unionists and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ). Furthermore, in view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than  days, and that none of the trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee would emphasise the principle that any person who is detained should immediately be brought before the competent court.
.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the detainees themselves, they were not dismissed, as they do not work in an employment relationship but as a crew engaged under a contract for services, although since being detained they have been unable to obtain contracts with building enterprises, only with individuals. The Committee also notes that, according to the authorities, the persons concerned do not appear to be actually working in the construction industry.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organisation mainly objects to the recognition by the Ministry of Labour on  October  of the executive committee elected at an assembly to reorganise the National Union of Construction Workers (SINATRAC), held on  October  and led by the Secretary-General of that organisation, Milciades Gimnez Daz, a supporter of government policy.
.The Committee also observes that, some months earlier, on  March , a split occurred in the executive committee of SINATRAC, dividing it into two different factions: one headed by Milciades Gimnez Daz, Secretary-General of SINATRAC, and the other by Lino Gmez, Deputy Secretary-General of SINATRAC. Each faction organised an assembly to elect a new executive committee, as the term of office of the existing committee was due to expire on  October . Thus, the faction led by Milciades Gimnez Daz called an assembly on  October , while the faction led by Lino Gmez called another for  October , although the latter was postponed by the police and was held on  October .
.On  October , as stated, the Government recognised the executive committee elected at the assembly of  October  led by Milciades Gimnez Daz. However, when it was informed of the executive committee elected on  October  at the assembly led by Lino Gmez, the competent authority of the Ministry of Justice and Labour notified Lino Gmez on  November  of the text of a decision of the legal consultant's office stating that recognition could not be granted since ""by Resolution No.  dated  October of the current year the Labour Directorate registered the National Union of Construction Workers, whose executive committee is currently in office, and its term of office is due to expire in  according to its statutes"". A subsequent decision issued by the legal consultant's office, notified by the Director of Labour on  February , stated that an appeal could be lodged through the administrative disputes procedure.
.The Committee concludes that the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, aware of the existence of two assemblies to elect a new executive committee, appear to have based their recognition of one of the committees on considerations of time alone, that is, on the fact that the executive committee elected at the assembly led by Milciades Gimnez Daz was the first to apply for recognition. The Committee observes that the competent authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, referring to the allegations, told the representative of the Director-General that the situation was sometimes confusing, in the general context of the internal disagreement among the members of the executive committee of SINATRAC. According to the ministry authorities, once Lino Gmez had been informed of the decision to recognise the executive committee elected on  October , he could have lodged an administrative appeal against that decision.
.The Committee considers that, irrespective of whether such an appeal was possible (which Lino Gmez's group denies), the decision of  October  of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the executive committee elected by the assembly of  October  constitutes a decision that was arbitrary and taken in too great haste. The Ministry was fully aware that another duly convened assembly was to be held a few days later (on  October) for the same purpose. The Committee would like to point out that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation they should be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.
.The Committee observes that the representative of the Director-General was able to note the police surveillance and shadowing to which Ricardo Esperanza Leiva, former leader of the Liebig Refrigeration Union and leader of the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE), is being subjected. The Committee requests the Government to alter what it calls the methods of protecting the life and safety of Mr. Leiva so that, if considered objectively, there can be no confusion with police surveillance.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged torture of this trade union leader indicating what were the concrete facts leading to his detention, as well as on the alleged detention of Sebastin Rodrguez, Secretary-General of the Drivers' Union of Line .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:The Committee notes that a direct contacts mission visited the country from  to  September .Case No. (a) The Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(b) In view of the fact that, according to the Government, there is no reason from the legal standpoint why the Union of Journalists of Paraguay should not be set up, the Committee hopes that this union will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future.(c) The Committee draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.Case",-1,1983,Paraguay

.The complaint is contained in communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  and  May ; additional information was submitted in communications dated  October and  December . The Government replied in a communication dated  September .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  and  May , the complainant alleges that, through the Ministry of Labour and Political Police, the Government of Paraguay has engaged in repressive activities against the trade union organisations which have set up the Trade Union Solidarity Movement (MSS), which published its constitution and objectives on  September  in a paid advertisement in the daily newspaper ""ABC Color"". The complainant adds that, under the pretense that they are advocating ""a vast plan of Marxist agitation"", the police have been arresting many members of this trade union organisation, the MSS, and carrying out arbitrary searches and unlawful acts of repression in the middle of the night.For example, they have arrested Rubn Lisboa (a leader of the Banco del Brasil Trade Union and Federation of Bank Employees (FETRABAN)), Abel Grange (a shop employee), Gustavo Codas (an ABC Color journalist and member of the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP)), Roberto Villalba, Stella Rufinelli, Margarita Musse, Margarita Elas, Sonia Duque de Arriaza, Sonia Aquino, Desiderio Arzamendia, Benjamn Livieres, Silvano Presentado Acosta, Eulalia Leguizamn, Damin Vera (all employees of the Paraguayan Data Bank (BPD), an advisory institution specialising in the analysis and compilation of national data), Rubn Mir, Javier Joy Salomoni, Fernando Rodrguez Alcal, Juan Carlos Oviedo and Mara Herminia Feliciangeli (university leaders).
.The complainant further alleges that the Minister of the Interior has threatened to send the union leaders, university leaders and journalists who are members of the SPP into exile.
.The complainant states, moreover, that ABC Color, which published the notice announcing the setting up of the MSS, has been systematically threatened and that its free circulation has been restricted and unlawfully hindered by the police who hold up the vehicles distributing the newspaper every day. On  May , police officers surrounded the newspaper's premises early in the morning and seized the copies that were to be sent to the interior of the country.
.In its communications dated  October and  December , the complainant indicates that the MSS members cited in its earlier communication are still being held in custody and that their state of health is extremely alarming as a few weeks before they went on an indefinite hunger strike.
.The complainant states that for the past four years the Union of Journalists of Paraguay has been seeking legal personality through the Ministry of Justice and Labour but that its efforts have been in vain because of the systematic refusal of the authorities to grant the Union legal authorisation. Regarding the Union's leaders, the complainant notes that the Secretary, Mr. Codas Friessmand, is still in asylum in the Venezuelan embassy from where he has been unable to obtain a safe conduct to leave the country and that the Secretary-General, Mr. Alcibiades Gonzlez del Valle, an ABC Color journalist, was arrested on  September ""on orders from above"" and, once in prison, was accused of infringing Act No.  on ""the defence of democracy"". Furthermore, on  July  Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo Director of ABC Color, was arrested for allowing publication of and comments on the events which give rise to the present complaint to the Committee on Freedom of Association. Moreover, Dr. Jorge Alvarenga and Dr. Carlos Cuevas, of the University Hospital, were arrested by the police during a round-table discussion on ""Trade unionism and repression""; some days later Dr. Alvarenga was expelled from the country, while Dr. Cuevas is still in prison.
.The complainant further alleges that, in the La Americana S.A. textile company, a large number of workers have been arbitrarily dismissed following the submission by the trade unions of a list of demands. At the FRISA S.A. company, where the trade unions requested payment of wages due since June , the undertaking reacted by threatening the mass dismissal of  workers.
.Finally, the complainant alleges that Radio anduti (ZP ) was closed down for transmitting messages from the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile on  August . At the same time, the National Telecommunications Administration (ANTELCO), a State institution, banned the commentator and director of the radio station, Humberto Rubin, from exercising his profession.
.Referring to the alleged arrests, the Government states that on  August  the judge of the Criminal Court of First Instance ordered the release of Antonio Pez, Hans Grossen, Raquel Rojas de Carmona, Sonia Duque de Arriaza, Fernando Esteban Rodriguez Alcal Zuccolillo, Javier Antonio Joy Salomoni, Jos Rubn Mir and Eulalia Leguizamn, eight of the  persons charged with infringing Act No.  on the defence of law and order and freedom of the individual, which outlaws communism in Paraguay and provides for the trial and punishment of any person charged with subversive behaviour. The acting magistrate accepted the plea of the counsel for the defence and therefore ordered their release. The Government observes that the persons released were not directly involved in running the Paraguayan Data Bank, whose activities the police deemed to be subversive and a threat to the security of the State. Of those cited, Antonio Pez, Fernando E. Rodrguez Alcal Zuccolillo and Javier A. Joy Salomoni own two printing works where some of the publications of the Paraguayan Data Bank were printed.
.Concerning the  other persons charged (Sonia Cristina Aquino, Rubn Lisboa, Benjamn Ramos Livieres, Victoria Abel Granje, Silbano Presentado Acosta, Desiderio Arzamendia, Juan Francisco Arrn Suhurt, Agustn Chamorro, Roberto Villalba Esquivel, Ernest Grossen, Margarita Mussi and Josefina Frasqueri), the examining magistrate confirmed their prison sentences and they therefore remained in state penitentiaries. Subsequently, on  September , nine of those arrested for infringing the aforementioned Act and implicated in the Paraguayan Data Bank trial were released by the Criminal Appeals Court. As to the three other persons arrested (Ernest Grossen, Desiderio Arzamendia and Roberto Villalba Esquivel), the Criminal Appeals Court of Feria overturned the decision of the lower court judge on  January  and granted their release.
.The Government adds that on  January  the judge of the Criminal Court of First Instance of Feria revoked the prison sentence handed down on Mara Elizeche, Mnica Prez Cayetano Quatrolucchi and Luis Ernesto Heisecke, who had been subsequently charged along with the others.
.Consequently, continues the Government, all  persons initially",1,1983,Paraguay
117,"detained, plus four other subsequently charged with infringing Act No. , have now been released by order of the competent judge.
.Finally, the Government states that Gustavo Codas, who was dismissed some time ago from the newspaper where he was employed, is a fugitive from Paraguayan justice who escaped trial by seeking asylum in the Venezuelan embassy which he subsequently fled, thereby abusing the right of asylum and protection granted by the embassy.
.Regarding the alleged arrest of  members of the Trade Union Solidarity Movement (MSS) on the grounds that they were advocating a vast plan of Marxist agitation, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, one of them (Gustavo Codas) is a fugitive from Paraguayan justice who escaped trial and that  others were charged with infringing Act. No.  on the defence of law and order and freedom of the individual, which outlaws communism in Paraguay and provides for the punishment of any behaviour deemed to be subversive. According to the Government, these  persons were released by the judicial authorities; two on  January , five on  August  and six on  September .
.The Committee observes that the Government has not indicated the specific facts justifying the arrest and trial of these  trade unionists but has merely indicated that they were charged with infringing Act No.  on the defence of law and order and freedom of the individual which outlaws communism and provides for the punishment of any behaviour deemed to be subversive. In these circumstances, since the Government has not explicitly denied the complainant's contention that the arrests are part of a campaign of repression following the setting up of the MSS and since the judicial authorities have not upheld any of the charges brought against them, the Committee deeply regrets that they were deprived of their freedom for more than a year in most cases and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for trade union reasons constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association [see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the arrest of Stella Rufinelli, Margarita Elas, Damin Vera, Juan Carlos Oviedo and Maria Herminia Feliciangeli following the setting up of the MSS of which they are said to be members.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the remaining allegations: the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for the past four years in its attempts to obtain legal personality; the threatened exile of the leaders and members of the SPP; the arrest and trial of the leader of the SPP, Alcibiades Gonzlez del Valle; the arrest of Aldo Zuccalillo, Director of ABC Color, for allowing the publication of matters of trade union interest; the threats against, harassment of and restrictions imposed on this newspaper for publishing the setting up of the MSS; the arrest of Dr. Jorge Alvarenga and Dr. Carlos Cuevas during a round-table discussion on ""Trade unionism and repression""; the arbitrary dismissal of workers from the La Americana S.A. textile company following the submission by the trade unions of a list of demands; the threatened dismissal of  workers of the FRISA S.A. company following the request by the trade unions for payment of unpaid wages; the closing down of Radio anduti for transmitting messages from the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile and the ban on the commentator and director of the radio station from exercising his profession. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these matters without delay.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) Regarding the arrest of  members of the Trade Union Solidarity Movement as part of a campaign of repression following the setting up of this organisation, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, one of the persons concerned is a fugitive from justice who has not been arrested and  others were released without the judicial authorities upholding any charges against them. The Committee deeply regrets that these  trade unionists were deprived of their freedom for more than a year in most cases and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for trade union reasons constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the arrest of Stella Rufinelli, Margarita Elas, Damin Vera, Juan Carlos Oviedo and Maria Herminia Feliciangeli following the setting up of the MSS of which they are said to be members.(b) The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the' remaining allegations: the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for the past four years in its attempts to obtain legal personality; the threatened exile of the leaders and members of the SPP; the arrest and trial of the leader of the SPP, Alcibiades Gonzlez del Valle; the arrest of Aldo Zuccalillo, director of ABC Color, for allowing the publication of matters of trade union interest; the threats against, harassment of and restrictions imposed on this newpaper for publishing the setting up of the MSS; the arrest of Dr. Jorge Alvarenga and Dr. Carlos Cuevas during a round-table discussion on ""Trade unionism and repression""; the arbitrary dismissal of workers from the La Americana S.A. textile company) following the submission by the trade unions of a list of demands; the threatened dismissal of  workers of the FRISAI S.A. company following the request by the trade unions for payment of unpaid wages; the closing down of Radio Nanduti fort transmitting messages from the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile and the ban on the commentator and director of the radio station from exercising his profession. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these matters without delay.",0,1983,Paraguay
118,".The international Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented its complaint in a communication dated  February , to which was attached a letter from the Paraguayan. Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE) addressed to the Director-General and dated  December . The Government replied in a communication dated  September .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that the workers engaged in the construction of the Itaip hydroelectric dam have no trade union organisation and that every attempt to create one is repressed, in criminal violation of Conventions Nos.  and .
.The complainant adds that the labour standards governing safety and health contained in the ILO's Conventions are not applied and raises a series of issues regarding the workers' housing and the existence of hospitals, teaching institutions, nurseries and mother craft training centres.
.In its lengthy communication of  September , the Government categorically denies the allegations of the complainant and states that the working conditions afforded the workers concerned are perfectly decent and comprehensive. The Government goes on to refer to the relevant laws and regulations and describes in detail the conditions of work, safety and health under which the construction of the Itaip hydroelectric dam is being conducted and the facilities that are available to the workers.
.With regard to the alleged violation of the Conventions relating to freedom of association, the Government states that freedom of association does exist and that the trade union rights of workers recruited in the country are embodied in Paraguay's Labour Code. The Government further points out that the employees in Itaip have an association that is registered with the Ministry of Labour and that  trade unions of workers of various occupations with official union status, and the Regional Confederation of Workers of Alto Paran and Caaguaz, operate in the area.
.Finally, the Government states that neither direct nor indirect means of repression have been employed to prevent the organisation of trade unions or to hinder their activities and that, if the complaint makes no reference to any specific instance of a violation of Conventions NOS.  and , it is because no such violation has occurred.
.The Committee observes that the complainant has referred inter alia to the violation of ILO Conventions relating to occupational safety and health and that the Government has categorically denied these allegations. However, as it is restricted by its terms of reference to the examination of complaints arising from the violation of trade union rights, the Committee considers that it is not within its purview to express an opinion on this point.
.As to the allegation concerning the violation of Conventions Nos.  and , the Committee observes that, although the complainant alleges in general terms that workers employed on the Itaip hydroelectric dam do not have any trade union organisation and that any attempt to create one is repressed by criminal means, no indication has been given of any specific instances where such repression has occurred. Consequently, inasmuch as the complaint makes no mention of any specific instance of a violation of trade union rights in spite of the fact that the complainant was invited to submit additional information, and inasmuch as the Government denies the allegations and states that there is in fact a registered association for the Itaip workers, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1981,Paraguay
119,".In a letter dated  December  the Latin. American Central of workers submitted a complaint against the Government of Paraguay. The Government sent its comments in a letter dated  February .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Latin American Central of Workers alleged that on  December  the Government of Paraguay arrested the trade unionist Emigdio Colman.
.In its letter the Government stated that because of his political record a militant activist in the Christian Democratic Party, Mr. Colman was unable to complete the legal papers he needed to travel to the city of Caracas, Venezuela, where he was invited by CLAT to take part in a meeting of Latin American workers and the celebration of the th anniversary of the founding of the Latin American Central of Workers in December . In these circumstances, the Government reports, Mr. Colman appealed to the Venezuelan Embassy in Asuncin, where he obtained a Venezuelan emergency passport on which he then travelled. The Government adds that Mr. Colman was detained for investigation on  December  and released on  December .
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government to the effect that Mr. Colman was released.
.In connection with the situation arising from the procedure for obtaining Mr. Colman's exit permit to go to a meeting of CLAT in Venezuela, which is set out in the Government's letter, the Committee recalls that in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , workers associations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers. This principle implies the right of representatives of national trade union organisations to maintain contact with the international organisations with which they are affiliated, to take part in the work of these organisations and to receive the benefits implied by such affiliation. The Committee recalls that or a previous occasion it noted that unless the formalities required of trade unionists to leave the country, are imposed on objective grounds they may involve the risk of infringing the principle of the right of national workers' associations to send representatives to international trade union congresses. In the present case the Government's statement that ""because of his political background Mr. Emigdio Colman was unable to complete the legal documentation required to travel to the city of Caracas"" does not appear properly to explain the criteria used to prevent Mr. Colman from completing the legal documents required for the journey.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that since the person concerned has been released and subject to the principles and considerations set out in the preceding paragraph, the case does not call for further examination.",0,1979,Paraguay
120,".By a telegram dated  December , the World Confederation of Labour presented a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Paraguay. The contents of this communication were transmitted to the Government, and at the request of the WCL the Director-General personally sent a telegram to the Government, which forwarded its observations on  March .
.Paraguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCL's communication stated that the police had arrested  trade union officials in Paraguay. These included Rodolfo Romero, Emilio Valenti, Victoriano Centurin, Florencio Rivero and Fulgencio Barreiro. According to other information communicated by the WCL, the officials arrested on  December  were the leaders of the National Central of Workers in Urban Sectors (CNTU). The two first named occupied respectively the posts of Director of the WCL's Regional Training institute and official in charge of training for peasants.
.In its communication the Government states that the persons named in the complaint were deprived of their liberty for breaches of Act No. /, respecting the defence of democracy and the public peace. They were prosecuted, and in February  they were all set at liberty after final judgements had been pronounced.
.The Committee notes with interest that the trade unionists mentioned in the WCL's complaint have been released in pursuance of court decisions. The Committee must, however, express its regret that the Government has supplied no information as to the precise grounds on which the persons in question were originally arrested.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest that the trade unionists mentioned in the complaint are now at liberty;(b) to decide that, in view of this fact, no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of the case.",0,1977,Paraguay
121,".The Committee last examined this case in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Eight to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still outstanding refer to the arrest of Domingo Melchor and Santiago Roln Centurin, brothers of the assassinated trade unionist Martino Roln Centurin, the proceedings instituted against Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan, and the alleged torture of a number of trade unionists in custody.
.The Government informed the Committee that a warrant for Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan's arrest was issued on  December  for contravening Act No. / respecting the preservation of the public peace and personal freedom. The Government also stated that Mr. Ojeda Falkan was interrogated on  March . The Government has sent no information on the brothers of Martino Roln Centurin or on the allegations concerning the torture and ill-treatment suffered by trade unionists in custody.
.In its last examination of the case, the Committee observed that there was considerable delay before the decision to issue a warrant for the arrest of Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan and his interrogation: by a magistrate. The Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, expressed the hope that Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan would soon be judged and that the Government would communicate, as soon it was pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. Also on the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body requested the Government to provide information concerning the situation of the brothers of Martino Roln Centurin and its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody.
.At its meetings in February, May and November , the Committee had to postpone its examination of this case, as it had not received the information requested of the Government. At its meeting in February  the Committee again postponed its examination of the case for the same reason. Accordingly, the Governing Body notified the Government that in conformity with the procedure of the Committee, the latter might present a report on the substance of the matter at its next session, even if the observations of the Government were not received by that date. The Committee has not yet received this information.
.In these circumstances, and before examining the substance of the case, the Committee considers it necessary to recall the considerations set forth in its First Report, which it has repeated on various occasions, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.The Committee expresses its deep concern that the Government has not sent the observations which have been requested of it on repeated occasions and that, given the time which has elapsed, it is compelled to examine the case without having received them.
.As regards the allegations relating to Domingo Melchor and Santiago Roln Centurin and Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan, the Committee recalls that it has emphasised that the detention of trade union officials, even for reasons of internal security, may constitute a grave interference with trade union rights unless accompanied by the appropriate judicial safeguards. In many cases where allegations that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested or sentenced on account of trade union activities have been refuted by governments or met with statements that the arrest or detention was made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further information as precise as possible concerning the alleged measures, and in particular concerning the judicial proceedings taken, and to supply the texts of sentences pronounced, together with the reasons adduced therefore, to enable it to examine the allegations with full knowledge of the facts.
.As regards the allegations of ill-treatment of workers in custody, the Committee recalls the importance it has always attached to the right of trade unionists, as of all other persons, to enjoy the guarantees afforded by due process of law in accordance with the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its deep concern that, despite the requests made, the Government has not sent the information requested and that the Committee has been obliged to examine the case without having received these observations;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above, and in particular to the principle that the detention of trade union officials may constitute a grave interference with trade union rights unless attended by the appropriate judicial safeguards;(c) to urge the Government to keep the Committee informed of the situation of the Roln Centurin brothers and the proceedings against Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan, and to communicate the text of the judgement given, with the reasons adduced therefore;(d) to urge the Government to send the Committee its observations on the allegations of ill-treatment of trade unionists in custody.
.The Committee already examined this case in November  when it submitted interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (November ).
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants stated that the Christian-inspired trade union movement was being systematically persecuted in Paraguay. They also claimed that torture was being shamelessly practised and expressed the view that a skirmish in April  between the armed forces and a group of guerilleros had been used as a pretext for attacking any organisation working to bring about social reform and an improvement in the miserable lot of the peasants.
.The allegations outstanding refer, first of all, to the peasants' trade union leaders Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez who, the complainants alleged, had been arrested and tortured at the beginning of may . They added that another active peasants' trade unionist, Severo Delgado, had, about the same time, been sought by the police who had raided his house; he had managed to escape to Brazil together with other persons. The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) also mentioned the disappearance, on  April , of the peasants' trade union leader, Martin Roln Centurin. The complainants had reason to believe that he was alive and in custody at a National Guard barracks and had been subjected to torture; he had never been charged with any offence nor brought to trial nor convicted. The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) specified that the person in question had been wounded on the day of his arrest while trying to defend his home. He was in solitary confinement and in a piteous state. The three brothers of Martin Roln Centurin were also in custody: Domingo at the Investigation Department (where there were said to be torture chambers), and Melchor and Santiago, against whom legal proceedings were pending, at Emboscada Penitentiary.
.The Government stated that there had at no time been any infringement of freedom of association; no genuine trade union leader, past or present, had ever been hindered in the performance of his functions. As for the others, the Government stated that it had no knowledge of their whereabouts and refuted the allegations made, claiming that those who were active and knowledgeable in the labour field and who acted within the framework of the Constitution and the national law, had never mentioned having difficulties of any kind whatsoever inside or outside their unions. As to Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez, they were still in Emboscada Prison, awaiting trial by the ordinary courts on charges of contravening Act No.  respecting the preservation of the public peace and personal freedom. These facts showed clearly, continued the Government, that these persons did not belong to any trade union or suchlike organisation operating lawfully in Paraguay.
.The Committee considered that it needed further information on these various points and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body requested the Government, in particular:- to supply detailed information as to the specific acts Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jose Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez were said to have committed and to communicate, as soon as they were pronounced, the texts of the judgements handed down in respect of these persons and the reasons adduced therefor;- to supply also information as to the situation of Severo Delgado and Martin Roln Centurin, and the latter's brothers, and the specific acts of which they were accused, to state",0,1976,Paraguay
122,"whether legal proceedings had been instituted against them and, if so, to communicate the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefor;- to provide its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody.
.The Government replied in a letter dated  September . It states that a warrant for Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan's arrest was issued on  December ; he is being charged in the ""Carlos Guillermo Braas and others"" case for contravening the aforementioned Act No. /. He is accused of involvement with a subversive group known as the military Political Organisation (OPM), which has been engaged in clandestine activities in the country. The discovery of one of its cells by the police, continues the Government, led to an armed confrontation at the beginning of April . Three members of the OPM, including Martin Roln Centurin, were wounded and later died; two police officers were also wounded. Jose Gill Ojeda Falkan is being held in Emboscada Prison. In March , he was interrogated and the report of his interrogation has been placed in his file. The Government notes that its information concerning Martin Roln Centurin derives from a report of the penal court of first instance.
.The Government goes on to say that Jos Parra Gaona, Pedro Fretez and Severo Candia Delgado were released from custody on  December ,  April  and  March , respectively. It concludes that none of the people referred to have been brought to trial for exercising trade union activities since none of them belong to any legally constituted union organisation.
.On the latter point, the Committee wishes to emphasise, as it did when it previously examined this case, that the fact that national organisations of workers have not been officially recognised is no justification for the rejection of allegations if it is clear from the complaints that these organisations have at least a de facto existence.
.The Committees notes the information supplied by the Government on the circumstances of the death of Martin Roln Centurin. It also takes note of the release from custody of Jose Parra Gaona, Pedro Fretez and Severo Candia Delgado. The fact remains, however, that Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez at least, after their arrest at the beginning of May , were imprisoned for many months without it being apparent from available information that they had been tried. Moreover, the Government has not indicated the specific acts for which they were imprisoned. Admittedly, the mere fact of carrying on a trade union activity or holding responsibilities in a trade union does not imply any immunity from ordinary penal legislation. However, unless it is duly established in a court of law that they have contravened this legislation, the prolonged detention of trade unionists is liable to appear as a hindrance to the normal operation of a union organisation and as a means of intimidating its militants and even its rank-and-file members.
.In the case of Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, too, there was considerable delay between the decision to issue a warrant for his arrest and his interrogation by a magistrate. In fact, legal proceedings against him are still pending. The Committee trusts that he will soon be judged by an ordinary court and that the Government will communicate the text of the judgement handed down and the reasons adduced therefor so that the Committee can be sure that the person concerned is not being held for legitimate union activities.
.The Government, finally, has not provided its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note with interest the release of Jos Parra Gaona, Pedro Fretez and Severo Candia Delgado, while drawing the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph ;(b) to take note with regret the incidents described by the Government in its communication which led to the death of Martin Roln Centurin; to request the Government once again to provide information concerning the situation of the brothers of Mr. Centurin and to state whether legal proceedings have been instituted against them;(c) to express the hope that Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan will soon be judged and that the Government will communicate, as soon as it is pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down and the reasons adduced therefor;(d) to request the Government once again to provide its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody;(e) to take note of this interim report.
.The complaints of the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) are contained in two letters dated respectively  July and  July . The CLAT supplied further information in communications dated  July  and  July . The WCL also provided additional information in a letter dated  August .
.The Government communicated certain observations by a letter dated  August . As authorised under the procedure, the Director-General, considering - without going into the substance of the issue - that this letter did not contain sufficient information to enable the Committee to examine the case, wrote on behalf of the Committee directly to the Government pointing out that it would be desirable for it to supply more specific information concerning the points raised by the complainants. In May , this information still not having been received despite repeated requests, the Committee appealed to the Government to supply the information requested as a matter of urgency. The Government replied by a letter dated  September .
.Paraguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The CLAT, acting on behalf of its affiliated organisation, the National Central of Urban Workers (CNTU), stated in its communications of July  that the leaders of the trade unions connected with the CLAT, as well as the peasants' movement, were being subjected to attacks and persecution. It mentioned in particular the names of the following leaders, who, it claimed, had been arrested and tortured at the beginning of may :- Emigdio Colman Nuez, General Secretary of the CNTU, arrested with his -year old son;- Oscar Vicente Rodas, leader of the urban sector, joiner, arrested with his -year old daughter and his -year old son;- Julian Flor, Jos Ojeda, Jos Parra, Fretez and other leaders of the peasants' movement.The complainant also mentioned the closing down of the John XXIII People's Institute, founded by the Christian Central of workers - now the CNTU - for the benefit of the country's youth..The CLAT also described incidents which had occurred during the same period in the town of Pedro Juan caballero, involving trade union leaders: Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln had been arrested and taken to the offices of the government delegation, where they were held for  days; Severo Delgado, an active peasants' trade unionist, was wanted by the police, who raided his house; he managed to escape to Brazil together with other persons. The CLAT expressed the opinion that the Christian inspired trade union movement was being systematically persecuted in Paraguay. It also claimed that torture was being shamelessly practised.
.The CLAT also described incidents which had occurred during the same period in the town of Pedro Juan caballero, involving trade union leaders: Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln had been arrested and taken to the offices of the government delegation, where they were held for  days; Severo Delgado, an active peasants' trade unionist, was wanted by the police, who raided his house; he managed to escape to Brazil together with other persons. The CLAT expressed the opinion that the Christian inspired trade union movement was being systematically persecuted in Paraguay. It also claimed that torture was being shamelessly practised.
.The WCL also referred in its letter of  July  to the arrest on  and  May  of a number of the persons mentioned by the CLAT. It drew attention to the violence and repression being unleashed against trade unionists, especially leaders and militants in the peasants' sector. It expressed the view that a skirmish in April  between the armed forces and a group of guerrilleros had been used as a pretext for attacking any organisation working to bring about social reform and an improvement in the miserable lot of the peasants.
.The CLAT added in its letter of  July  - claiming to speak on behalf of the Christian agrarian leagues of Paraguay - that the peasants' trade union leader Martino Roln Centurin had disappeared mysteriously on  April , no doubt arrested by the National Guard. The complainants had reason to believe that he was alive and in custody at a National Guard barracks, and had been subjected to torture. He had never been charged with any offence, nor brought to trial, nor convicted. The WCL's communication of ",0,1976,Paraguay
123,"August  referred to the same facts. It specified that the person in question had been wounded on the day of his arrest while trying to defend his home. He was in solitary confinement and in a piteous state. The WCL further stated that the three brothers of Martin Roln Centurion were also in custody: Domingo at the Investigation Department (where there were torture chambers), and Melchor and Santiago, against whom legal proceedings were pending, at Emboscada Penitentiary.
.In its first communication dated  August , the Government stated that the Ministry of Justice and Labour had always upheld the rights of all workers and that the Government was ready to dialogue with lawfully established trade unions, which enjoyed guarantees in conformity with the Government's economic and social policy. The right to associate was recognised in the National Constitution, but its exercise had to be regulated by administrative rules to ensure that no harm was done to the national community. The Government went on to state that the unions cited by the complainants were totally unknown to the Ministry, with which the lawfully recognised organisations were registered. The latter would be justified in complaining to international bodies if it could be proved that their rights were being violated. Statements by illegal organisations of the kind involved in the present case - which had never been recognised, and had moreover never applied for recognition - were pure inventions submitted solely for the purpose of giving a false impression of the real situation in the country, for the furtherance of contemptible interests contrary to the general interests of the nation. At no time, added the Government, had there been any infringement of freedom of association; no genuine trade union leader, now or in the past, had ever been hindered in the performance of his functions. As for the others, the Government stated that it had no knowledge of their whereabouts and refuted the allegations made, claiming that those with a full knowledge of the facts who were active in the labour field, within the framework of the Constitution and the national law, had never mentioned having any difficulties of any kind whatsoever inside or outside their unions.
.The Government specified, in its letter of  September , that Messrs. Emigdio Colman Nuez, Julian Flor Lugo and Oscar Vicente Rodas had been arrested because they were believed to have participated in subversive activities; all three had now been released - the first two in , and the third in March . As for Messrs. Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez, they were still in Emboscada Prison, awaiting trial in the ordinary courts on charges of contravening Act No.  respecting the preservation of the public peace and personal freedom. These facts showed clearly, continued the Government, that these persons did not belong to any trade union or suchlike organisation operating lawfully in Paraguay.
.As concerns the closing down of the John XXIII Institute, the Government stated that this had been decided upon by the competent ministry because the persons in charge had failed to comply with the legal requirements with respect to the operation of intermediate-level educational institutions. The decision was based on section (c) of Decree No.  of  February , which stipulates that an establishment may not operate with less than a minimum of  pupils per course - a requirement that the institute in question was unable to meet; it was notified of the decision on  February . In conclusion, the Government repeated its statement that freedom of association prevailed in Paraguay.
.Before examining the specific allegations made in this case, the Committee wishes to recall that in determining whether or not an organisation is occupational in character it has never considered itself bound by any national definition of what constitutes an occupational organisation; it has stated, for example, that failure by an organisation to file its rules in accordance with national legislation would be no adequate reason for declaring a complaint irreceivable, since the principles of freedom of association demand that workers should not have to obtain prior authorisation before establishing organisations of their own choosing to further and defend their interests. In the present instance, the fact that the national organisations of workers cited have not been officially recognised is no justification for the rejection of the allegations - which have moreover been presented by the CLAT and by the WCL - since it is clear from the complaints that these organisations have at least a de facto existence.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government on the substance of the case. However, the Government has furnished no particulars as to the reasons for the arrest of Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln, the measures taken against Severo Delgado or the fate of Martino Roln Centurin and his brothers. Nor has it communicated its observations in reply to the allegations to the effect that a number of the trade unionists named by the complainants have been subjected to ill-treatment.
.As regards the John XXIII Institute, the complainants have not furnished evidence to prove that the closing down of this intermediate-level educational institution, as it has been defined by the Government, constituted interference with the exercise of trade union rights.
.While the Committee notes the release of Emigdio Colman Nuez, Julian Flor, Lugo and Oscar Vicente Rodas, and of Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln, it wishes nevertheless to point out, as it has done many times in the past, that the detention by authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights; the government concerned should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the dangers of detention for trade union activities.
.As concerns Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez, who are still in prison awaiting trial, the Government had not supplied any information as to the actual facts which led to their arrest. In this connection, it should be recalled, as the Committee has already done, particularly in other cases relating to Paraguay, that where complainants allege that workers or trade union leaders have been arrested for trade union activities, and the replies of the government concerned amount to general denials of the allegations or are simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for crimes under the ordinary law, the Committee follows the rule that the government concerned should be requested to submit further information, as precise as possible, about the arrests and the reasons for them; it has requested, in particular, information concerning any legal proceedings instituted and their outcome, so that it can have all the facts before it when examining the allegations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph , that the allegations relating to the closing down of the John XXIII Institute do not call for further examination;(b) to note with interest the release of Emigdio Colman Nuez, Julian Flor Lugo and Oscar Vicente Rodas, and of Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln, but to recall that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve severe restrictions of trade union rights;(c) to request the Government, for the reasons stated in paragraph , to supply detailed information as to the specific acts Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jose Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez are said to have committed, and to communicate, as soon as they are pronounced, the texts of the judgements handed down in respect of these persons and the reasons adduced therefor;(d) to request the Government to supply also information as to the situation of Severo Delgado and Martino Roln Centurin, and the latter's brothers, and the specific acts of which they are accused, to state whether legal proceedings have been instituted against them and, if so, to communicate the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefor;(e) to request the Government to provide its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody;(f) to take note of this interim report.",0,1976,Paraguay
124,".The Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unions submitted a complaint on  August  with the backing of the World Confederation of Labour (communication dated  August of that year). It was alleged that on  August , Angel Riveros, Secretary-General of the Confederation of Christian Workers and President of the Regional Federation of Christian Agricultural Leagues of the Department of Caaguaz, together with Juan Flix Martinez, Organisational Secretary of the Christian Peasant Federation of Paraguay, had been arrested.
.On  February , the World Confederation of Labour submitted a fresh allegation to the effect that Agripino Silva, a young Paraguayan trade unionist, responsible for the workers' education activities of the Confederation of Christian Workers, had been arrested on  January of that year. In another communication dated  March , the World Confederation of Labour affirmed that Efigenio Fernndez, General Secretary of the Confederation of Christian Workers, had been arrested on  March .
.In a communication sent on  February , the Government said, with reference to Angel Riveros and Juan Flix Martinez, that the names of the supposed leaders of the Confederation of Christian Workers appeared on the police records of the Departmental Authorities of Caaguaz, where they were arrested on  July  and released on  July . It added that the arrests did not result from trade union activities but from action involving breaches of law and order. Furthermore, the Paraguayan Ministry of Justice and Labour had no knowledge of the existence of the trade union offices supposedly held by the complainants, or of the alleged trade union organisations they claimed to represent.
.At its meeting in May , the Committee decided to ask the Government to comment on the specific charges brought against Riveros and Martinez, and to say whether they had been brought to justice. The Government was also asked to comment on the alleged detention of Agripino Silva and to indicate what his position was in the eyes of the law.
.The Government having failed to reply although repeatedly invited to supply comments and information, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, as well as to provide information about the allegation concerning Efigenio Fernndez, the Committee made an urgent appeal at its meeting in November . No answer having been received, it informed the Government, at its meeting in February , that under the procedure in force, the Committee was entitled to submit a report on the substance of the matter at its next session, even if the information asked for had not been received. Since this information was still not forthcoming, the Committee submitted its report to the Governing Body at its th Session (- June ). Paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st Report (approved by the Governing Body at that session) discuss the allegations and contain the Committee's recommendations.
.In accordance with those recommendations, the Governing Body recalled that as far as the arrest of trade unionists was concerned, in a number of cases where the complainants alleged that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests had been made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for crimes under ordinary law, the Committee followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further information, as precise as possible, about the arrests and the reasons for them, adding that if in certain cases the Committee had reached the conclusion that allegations relating to measures taken against trade unionists did not call for further examination, this was only after it had received sufficient information from the governments showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures had in no way been occasioned by trade union activities, but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.The Governing Body also deplored the fact that despite reiterated appeals, the Government had not provided the information requested about the serious allegations made by the complainants, thus preventing the Committee from reaching its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.Lastly, the Governing Body asked the Director-General to make suitable approaches to the Government with a view to obtaining the information sought with regard to the trade unionists in question.
.Accordingly, the Director-General made repeated attempts to secure this information, while the Committee itself made further pressing appeals to the Government with the same end in view.
.Finally, the Government wrote on  December  to say that although the persons mentioned were not registered as trade union leaders with the Ministry of Justice and Labour, Angel Riveros and Juan Flix Martinez had been arrested on  July  and released on  July of that year; Agripino Silva had been arrested on  January  and released on  February ; and Efigenio Fernndez, arrested on  March , had been released on  March . All these men, according to the Government, had been arrested for breaches of the peace.
.The Committee takes due note of this communication, though it regrets that the Government has failed to provide detailed information about the specific charges brought against these persons, to enable it to reach its conclusions with an adequate knowledge of the facts.
.In any event, in view of the time which has elapsed since the events referred to by the complainants and the Government, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that the arrested trade unionists referred to in the complaints were released in July , February  and March ; and(b) in these circumstances, to decide that these cases do not call for further examination on its part.
.In a communication dated  August , the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) submitted certain allegations of infringements of trade union rights in Paraguay. The World Confederation of Labour (WCL), in a letter dated  August , supported this complaint. The Government, to which the text of the abovementioned communications had been sent, furnished certain observations in a letter dated  February . In a further communication dated  February  the WCL submitted fresh allegations.
.The WCL, in a communication dated  March , submitted additional allegations. The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which has not submitted any observations thereon.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Despite repeated requests to the Government by the Committee to supply more specific information concerning the allegations referred to in paragraph  above, and information concerning the allegations referred to in paragraph  above, the Government has, so far, failed to do so. Accordingly, at its session in November , the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information which the Committee had requested (th Report, paragraph ). No reply having been received to this appeal, the Committee, at its session in February , and in accordance with the rule of procedure contained in paragraph  of its th Report, informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the matter at its present session even if the information requested had not been received. This information has still not been received.
.In these circumstances, before examining the allegations, the Committee considers it appropriate to recall the observation which it made in paragraph  of its First Report, namely, "" the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward "".Allegations concerning the Arrest of the Trade Unionists Angel Riveros, Juan Flix Martinez and Agripino Silva
.In its letter of  August , the CLASC states that the Government has infringed trade union rights and interfered in the exercise of trade union activities. According to this complaint, Mr. Angel Riveros, Alternate Secretary-General of the Confederation of Christian Workers (CCT) and President of the Regional Federation of Christian Agricultural Leagues of the Department of Caaguaz, and Mr. Juan Flix Martinez, Organisation Secretary of the Christian Peasant Federation of Paraguay (FCC) were arrested at their homes. The CLASC adds that  hours after their arrest it was impossible to establish where they were imprisoned or to ascertain the actual grounds for their arrest. Steps were taken to secure this information, which was essential before any legal action could be taken on their behalf. According to the CLASC, the fact that the trade union leaders were hidden away and the lack of information as to their whereabouts are obvious proof of the infringements previously referred to. In its communication of  August , the World Confederation of",-1,1969,Paraguay
125,"Labour supports the complaint and requests the intervention of the ILO "" in order to obtain enlightenment as quickly as possible upon the fate met with by these trade union officials, and their speedy release if they are still being kept in custody by the police of that country "".
.In its communication of  February , the World Confederation of Labour states that according to information received, Mr. Agripino Silva, "" a young Paraguayan trade unionist, responsible for the workers' education activities of the CCT (Confederation of Christian Workers) "" was arrested and imprisoned by the police on  January . The complainant organisation refers to "" oppression and persecution "" perpetrated for years by the Government against the working masses, and states that "" the arbitrary and unjust arrest and imprisonment of Agripino Silva for his trade union activities is further glaring evidence of such practices "". The complainant organisation requests the ILO to intervene so that this trade unionist may be released immediately to resume his trade union activities in accordance with the International Labour Conventions and so that the Conventions may be respected and applied by the Government.
.In its communication of  February , the Government transmitted information on the allegations relating to Angel Riveros and Juan Flix Martinez, which had been provided by the Ministry of Justice and Labour. According to this information, the names of the supposed leaders of the Confederation of Christian Workers appear on the police records of the Departmental Authorities of Caaguaz, where these persons were arrested on  July  and released on  July  "". The Government added that they were not arrested on account of their trade union activities but in connection with breaches of law and order. Trade union activities in Paraguay, stated the Government, were well safeguarded but the safeguards could not be invoked to justify non-observance of regulations on law and order. The trade union situation in the country was not what the Ministry of Justice and Labour would like it to be, owing to the absence of agricultural undertakings grouping a sufficient number of workers to enable trade unions or workers' associations to be formed. Rural activities were not carried on within large undertakings. Small family holdings were more common, farmed by the owners with the help of their relatives. The Ministry of Justice and Labour stated that it had no knowledge of the existence of the trade union offices mentioned in the complaint or of the supposed trade union organisations the complainants claimed to represent. The Ministry "" is satisfied with the development of the growing trade union movement in Paraguay and considers that this development cannot be impeded by complaints of non-existent infringements of freedom of association "".
.At its session in May  the Committee decided to request the Government to supply information concerning the actual offences imputed to Messrs. Riveros and Martinez which would have constituted breaches of public order and to indicate whether these persons were brought before the competent judicial authority. It also requested the Government to transmit its observations concerning the detention of Agripino Silva and to state the legal position of this person.Allegations concerning the Arrest of Efigenio Fernndez
.In its communication dated  March , the World Confederation of Labour referred to the arbitrary arrest of Efigenio Fernndez, Secretary-General of the Paraguayan Christian Workers' Confederation, and acting member of the Executive Committee of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions. Mr. Fernndez, state the complainants, was arrested in San Joaquin on  March  while accompanying an official of the Ministry of Agriculture at the founding of a peasant co-operative. As stated above, no reply has been received from the Government concerning these allegations.
.The Government having failed to supply the information requested from it concerning the allegations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observation made by the Committee as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to recall that, in cases involving the arrest of trade unionists, on various occasions, when governments have countered allegations according to which trade union leaders or workers had been arrested for trade union activities by stating that the persons in question had actually been arrested for subversive activities, for reasons of national security or for having committed common offences, the Committee has always followed the rule consisting in requesting the government concerned to supply further information as soon as possible with regard to the relevant arrests and the exact grounds on which they were made, adding that, if in some cases the Committee has decided that allegations concerning the arrest or detention of trade unionists did not require further examination, it has only done so after receiving information from the Government that proved conclusively that these arrests or detentions had no connection with trade union activities, but were occasioned by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature;(c) to recall the importance which should be attached to the principle that all arrested persons should be subject to normal judicial procedure in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in accordance with the principle that it is a fundamental right of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the American Convention on Human Rights;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights;(e) to deplore the fact that, despite repeated requests for information, the Government has not submitted the information sought by the Committee on the serious allegations made by the complainants, thereby making it impossible for the Committee to formulate its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts; and(f) to request the Director-General to maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain the information requested from it concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraphs  and  above who were arrested.",-1,1969,Paraguay

128,".The Committee examined this case previously at its November  Session, when it presented to the Governing Body certain conclusions, contained in paragraphs - of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (November ).
.In that report the Committee submitted its final recommendations on one aspect of the case, namely the allegations relating to the detention of some leaders of a trade union. Still awaiting examination is another aspect of the case, concerning allegations of the taking over of the same trade union, in connection with which the Government was asked for additional information. The paragraphs which follow will deal only with this second aspect of the case.
.In a communication dated  June  the Government supplied the additional information that had been requested.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the Committee's opinion it is of paramount importance that in such circumstances measures for the dismissal, suspension or disqualification of trade union officials as a penalty provided by law should not become enforceable except on the basis of a firm sentence on the part of the competent judicial authority or, in any case, after the period allowed for the submission of an appeal has elapsed without such an appeal having been made. Moreover, although knowledge of the law is normally taken for granted, it would be desirable when notifying the persons concerned of the administrative resolution, to inform them at the same time that they may submit an appeal through the administrative disputes procedure.
.In the present case the question of an appeal to their judicial authorities does not seem to have been raised.
.In any case, taking into account that the taking over of the union had already been annulled and that the sanction of disqualification imposed on various trade union leaders for five years was repealed after two years, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to the principles mentioned in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee and subject to the considerations contained in paragraphs  to  above, that the allegations pending in this case and consequently the case as a whole do not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  February  from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (C.L.A.S.C.). The text was forwarded to the Government with a letter dated  February , together with the text of a statement made on  January  by the Christian Federation of Labour (Paraguay), which is affiliated to the C.L.A.S.C, and which had sent a signed copy of the statement to the I.L.O.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the C.L.A.S.C alleged that the workers and the executive Committee of the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Store had been the victims of an attack on freedom of association. The strike that they had declared to obtain better working conditions had been repressed by the Government. The C.L.A.S.C added that the Government had decided to take over the union, and had therefore dismissed the executive that had been elected by the workers themselves and installed in its place persons appointed by the labour authorities as administrators. Since the workers did not accept the coercive measure of the Government or the violation of freedom of association, the labour authorities ordered the imprisonment of the legitimate officers of the union. The C.L.A.S.C concluded by requesting the I.L.O. to intervene in defence of trade union rights and Conventions Nos.  and .
.In the document sent by the Christian Federation of Labour (Paraguay) dated  January , it is indicated, among other things, that as a result of strikes carried out by the union in the undertaking, the National Directorate of Labour, meeting a request by the employers, decided to take over the union and entrust its administration to three members of the Paraguayan Federation of Labour (C.P.T.). The document in question also stated that since the executive of the union had not complied meekly with the orders of the administrators, these administrators had succeeded in having the officers of the union deprived of civil rights for five years.
.It was also stated that, at the assembly held on  January  to elect new officers, the Paraguayan Federation of Labour had appointed the chairman and secretaries of the meeting, which had to be suspended on account of the general indignation of the members of the union and the certainty that the candidate who, according to the allegation, was nominated by a political organisation and by the undertaking would be rejected. The former officers were arrested. When the assembly was resumed on  January, some  persons "" who did not work in the Cold Store and who were not and never had been members of the Union "" created disturbances "" in collusion with members of the police force and of the C.P.T."" and had a report and a list of candidates approved. Nobody was allowed to speak, no other list was presented, and no vote was taken. According to the complainants, it was by all these means that an attempt was made to prevent the list of candidates supported by the majority of the members and headed by genuine trade union leaders from taking control of the leadership of the union.
.In its letter of  June , the Government encloses a copy of a communication from the Ministry of Justice and Labour, the substance of which is as follows: As a result of complaints received from the International Products Corporation, the labour authorities became aware of the succession of strikes by the workers of the San Antonio Cold Store, who had failed to comply with any of the requirements laid down by the Labour Code (sections ,  and ). In view of this serious situation, the Directorate of Labour asked the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Store for information. The union replied that the previous three strikes had not been authorised by it and that they had been carried out by a decision of the workers and without the knowledge of the union officers. This clear and categorical statement led to the conclusion that the union, having had no part in these serious events, had lost authority over its members, and that it was therefore necessary to take over the union with a view to restoring normal conditions and bringing labour-management relations back to the right channels. The Labour Directorate, by virtue of resolution No.  of  July , declared that the union was taken over.
.The communication from the Ministry of Justice and Labour states that the taking over was carried out without interference by the administrative authorities, this task being entrusted to the C.P.T, to which the union was affiliated, and that it was this Federation that had appointed the committee of administration. The administrators' report stated that there had been irregular administration and mismanagement of the funds of the union, which had lost all authority and control over its members. For these reasons, the administrators convened a general assembly, with all the necessary formalities, at which the members appointed their officers freely and democratically without any coercion.
.The Ministry states categorically that there was no interference by the labour authorities in the assembly. It says that those who complained that force had been used to impose the election of sham trade union leaders were not telling the truth, since it was the Federation to which the union belonged that has been entrusted with its administration, and that there was no truth in the accusation that the labour authorities had ordered the imprisonment of the union leaders, such a measure being outside their powers.
.The Ministry of Justice and Labour states that reports obtained from the National Directorate of Technical Affairs of the Ministry of the Interior indicate that the workers Mauro Ramirez Arias, Cecilio Rojas Bedoya, Antonio Pereira Ayala and Csar Rufino Bedoya had been arrested on  January  for questioning in connection with the commission of subversive activities in the San Antonio area, and that they had been released on  January. On  January, the date of the assembly, no worker of the Cold Store was still under detention.
.The Government asserts that labour-management relations are now fully normal. It also denounces "" pseudo-union activities of a communist nature that are carried on in the name of Christian democracy in all the freely functioning unions, with the obvious purpose of destroying and dividing the working class "".Allegations relating to the Arrest of Union Leaders
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statement that no leader of the union in question has been arrested at the",0,1967,Paraguay
129,"instigation of the labour authorities. However, from the other information contained in the detailed reply of the Government, and in particular from that supplied by the Ministry of the Interior, it appears that Messrs. Ramirez, Rojas, Pereira and Bedoya were detained for some  days for suspected subversive activities and that they were released some days before the assembly at which the new executive of the union was elected.
.The Committee wishes to recall that in previous cases in which it was alleged that trade union leaders had been preventively detained, it has considered that measures of preventive detention may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights which it would seem necessary to justify by the existence of a serious emergency and which would be open to criticism unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period, and that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the observance of human rights and especially the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee has also pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights. In these cases, the Committee has recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities
.In the present case, the available information does not show that the men were detained as a result of legal proceedings. Nevertheless, as they have since been released, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, subject to the considerations referred to in the preceding paragraph, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations relating to the Taking Over of a Union
.From the information supplied to the Committee, it appears that the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Store was taken over from July  to January . According to the statement of the Government, the reasons for this measure were the fact that the workers had declared several strikes without observing the requirements laid down in the Labour Code, these decisions being also taken independently of the union and the need to bring labour-management relations back to the right channels. In its reply, the Government also mentions certain acts of mismanagement of union funds, but this question, on which no details are supplied, appears to have been raised a posteriori, that is, in the report of the administrators.
.One of the provisions of the Labour Code, to which the Government refers, lays down that before the workers belonging to a union can declare a strike, the decision shall be agreed to by two-thirds of the members, after discussion at a general meeting, and secret ballot under the supervision of the competent labour authority (section  (b)). It should also be pointed out that, in accordance with section , whenever a strike is declared by a number of workers less than that indicated above, the competent authority shall declare that a state of strike does not exist, and order any workers who have left their employment to report back for work within the next  hours, under pain of termination of their contract of employment. Under section  of the Code, failure to comply with the other previous conditions as to form results in the workers concerned being disciplined by the non-payment of their wages during the period of the strike.
.The question raised in the complaint does not, however, refer to the application of provisions relating to strikes but to the alleged violation of the independence of the union, to measures taken against the leaders in office at the time, and to the actions of the administrators, who, according to the complainants, had lent themselves to manoeuvres designed to impose the appointment of an executive lacking the support of the majority of the members.
.The C.L.A.S.C states, in effect, that the taking over resulted in the dismissal of the previous executive, and the Christian Federation of Labour mentions the deprivation of civil rights for five years imposed on the members thereof. Further, at the meeting convened by the administrators, at which persons having no connection with the union had taken part by force, the members had not been able to present other candidates, to speak, or to vote.
.The Government replies to this that the administrative labour authority did not interfere in matters concerning the union, that the assembly was convened in accordance with all the formalities, and that the members elected their officers freely, democratically, and without coercion.
.It will be realised that the only respect in which all this information is consistent is in so far as it refers to the taking over of the union itself and to the fact that the Paraguayan Federation of Labour was entrusted with the task by the Government. This latter fact, although it gives a special nature to the case, cannot in itself be sufficient reason for regarding the examination of the allegations as closed. It should be recalled that in an earlier case, in which the Committee considered that the complainants had not furnished proof that the government concerned had intervened directly in trade union life, the Committee emphasised nevertheless that freedom of association should be ensured in fact as well as in law and drew the attention of the government to the desirability of taking appropriate measures, if necessary, to ensure the free exercise of the right to organise of workers and employers even in their relations with other organisations or third parties. In the present case the Government itself states that it entrusted the task of taking over the organisation in question to the Paraguayan Federation of Labour.
.The C.L.A.S.C refers to the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), both of which have been ratified by Paraguay. The only allegation to which the second of these Conventions can have any relevance is that referring to the support said to have been given by the undertaking to a candidate for office on the new executive of the union. Under Article , paragraph , of Convention No. , workers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference such as those designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations. The complainants, however, give no details to support this allegation,
.On the other hand, the very fact of the taking over, the preventive detention of the officers of the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Store shortly before the trade union elections and the detailed allegations that this taking over prevented the members of the union from taking part freely in the assembly and, in particular, in the election of its officers-allegations of which the Government denies the truth-do have a connection with Article  of Convention No. , which provides, inter alia, that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.Lastly, the Committee has received no information from the Government on the allegation that the former officers have been deprived of civil rights for five years. If this measure has been taken, it would be important, for the further examination of the case, to know whether it is still in force and on what legal provisions it is based.
.For the above reasons, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to emphasise the importance it has always attached to the provision of Article  of Convention No.  referred to above, and also to ask the Government for information on the point mentioned in paragraph .
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations concerning the detention of various officers of the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Stores, subject to the principles set forth in paragraph  above, to note that the persons concerned have been released and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) in respect of the allegations concerning the taking over of this trade union:(i) to emphasise once again the importance that it has always attached to the provision contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), in accordance with which workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to",1,1967,Paraguay
130,"formulate their programmes and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(ii) to request the Government to be good enough to state as soon as possible whether there is a measure in force, as the complainants say, depriving the former members of the executive of the union of civil rights and to indicate the legal provisions on which any such measure is based;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested from the Government in clause (b) (ii) of this paragraph.",-1,1967,Paraguay
131,".By a communication dated  May  the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) lodged a complaint alleging violation of freedom of association by the Government of Paraguay. This communication was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations on  August .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.C.L.A.S.C alleges that Mr. Efigenio Fernndez, General Secretary of the Christian Workers' Association (C.C.T.), was arrested on  May  after protesting on behalf of C.C.T against the arrest of Mr. Fulgencio Bareiro Rodas, Executive Secretary of C.L.A.S.C for the Atlantic region. The complaint states that Mr. Bareiro Rodas was arrested in connection with a telegram he had received from an organisation of Cuban workers in exile, that Mr. Fernndez was still under arrest at the time of the complaint and that no news had been received of him since his arrest.
.With regard to Mr. Bareiro Rodas, Executive Secretary of C.L.A.S.C for the Atlantic region, the Government explains in its communication of  August  that his arrest was ordered with a view to investigating the wording of a telegram he had received referring to "" mobilisation of organisations "". The Government believed that this expression might be interpreted in the sense of a rising by the trade unions with a view to overthrowing the established order. The Government further states that Mr. Bareiro Rodas was immediately released and it quotes the wording of the telegram, which was sent from Caracas and was signed by Mr. Eduardo Garcia, who is Executive Secretary of C.L.A.S.C for the Caribbean region according to the information available to the International Labour Office. The wording of the telegram as quoted by the Government is as follows:Please mobilise C.L.A.S.C organisations in zone to demand stoppage indiscriminate bombardment Dominican civilian population guarantee human rights and restoration of democracy and liberty and prevent unilateral intervention by United States.
.The Committee believes it may understand that as soon as the authorities were convinced that the telegram was not intended for the purpose originally suspected they immediately released Mr. Bareiro Rodas. The text as transcribed does not relate specifically to trade union matters but rather to political action in regard to which the Committee is not competent.
.In these circumstances the Committee, considering that the evidence submitted does not show that the measures taken by the authorities with regard to Mr. Bareiro Rodas constitute violation of freedom of association, recommends that the Governing Body decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.With regard to Mr. Fernndez the Government states that he was arrested on the grounds of contempt of authority, as described in section  of the Penal Code, and was released on  May .
.Since the complainants state that Mr. Fernndez was arrested on  May , he would seem to have been under arrest for some ten days. The Committee concludes that the charges referred to in the previous paragraph were not maintained.
.In numerous cases in the past the Committee has pointed out that in all cases in which trade union leaders are preventively detained these measures may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights; that it would appear necessary that they should be justified by a serious emergency; that, unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period, they are open to criticism; and that it should be the policy of every government to ensure that human rights are properly safeguarded, particularly the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee has also pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note that Mr. Fernndez has been released and to decide, therefore, while pointing out to the Government that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In view of the above, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the arrest of Mr. Fulgencio Bareiro Rodas, to note that this trade union leader has been released, and to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the arrest of Mr. Efigenio Fernndez, to note that this trade union leader has been released, and to decide, therefore, while pointing out to the Government that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1965,Paraguay
132,".The Committee previously examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (nd Report, paragraphs -).
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its session in May  the Committee had recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to forward its observations concerning one aspect of the complaint which remained outstanding, namely the allegations relating to the presence of police at trade union meetings. In this connection, the complainants had alleged that, to hold a trade union meeting, permission must be obtained from the police, who send an agent to attend the meeting and demand a copy of the minutes. In support of this allegation, the complainants supplied a copy of an application made on  January  by the Union of Printing Trade Workers of Paraguay to the Chief of Police of Asuncin, requesting permission to hold its ordinary General Assembly.
.Since May  the Committee has repeatedly postponed its examination of the case as no observations on this outstanding aspect of the case have been received from the Government. At its session in May  the Committee took note of a communication from the Government indicating that the matter in question was under examination by the competent national authorities. No observations, however, have yet been received from the Government on this matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee wishes to draw attention to the fact that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact and that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part will recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward. In the present case, the complainants have presented allegations which, in the opinion of the Committee, are sufficiently substantiated to warrant further inquiry. Such detailed allegations against a government should be met by detailed observations by the government concerned, in order to enable the Committee to reach definitive conclusions thereon. The Committee can only regret that, despite repeated requests, no reply on the allegations remaining outstanding has yet been received from the Government, thereby preventing the Committee from reaching conclusions in this case.
.With regard to the substance of the allegations, the Committee has frequently recalled that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. A situation in which prior permission was required for the holding of a trade union meeting, the presence of the police at such meetings and the requirement to furnish copies of the minutes of such meetings would clearly be incompatible with this principle.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret that, despite the many requests made since , the Government has not transmitted its observations concerning the allegations relating to the presence of police at trade union meetings;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations expressed in paragraph  above;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; and(d) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions dated  May . It was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  May . At its meetings in May , November  and February  the Committee repeatedly postponed examination of the case as no observations had been received from the Government.
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations relating to the registration of the Union of Salary and Wage Earners in Commerce:(i) to take note of the fact that the organisation in question has been registered since the complaint was submitted;(ii) to draw the Government's attention none the less to the importance which should be attached to the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Paraguay, to the effect that workers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof (Article  of the Convention), and to the principle that the right of workers to establish freely organisations of their own choosing (Article  of the Convention) cannot be considered to exist until such time as it is fully recognised and observed both de facto and de jure;(b) in respect of the allegations relating to the presence of police at trade union meetings, to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations upon these allegations;(c) to take note of the present interim report on the understanding that the Committee will report further on receipt of the observations to be requested from the Government under subparagraph (b) of this paragraph.",0,1965,Paraguay
133,".At its th Session (November ) the Committee continued its examination of this case, on which it had previously submitted two interim reports to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, respectively, and laid before the Governing Body its conclusions and recommendations which are contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. That report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The Committee notes with interest the adoption of these two codes and recognises that the provisions devoted to employers' and workers' organisations constitute a significant step forward in Paraguayan legislation as concerns the protection of freedom of association and trade union rights, and that these provisions are in part based on the generally accepted principles relating to freedom of association and trade union rights as contained in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Nevertheless, the Committee observes that some of the legislative provisions would seem to call for careful examination by the Government in order to bring them more fully into conformity with the terms of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which the Government has decided to ratify.
.Among these provisions are the exclusion from the scope of section  of the Labour Code of officials, salaried employees and manual workers employed by state undertakings, municipal authorities or autonomous corporations. It would, therefore, be desirable for the trade union rights of the above categories of workers to be expressly recognised in the Labour Code or in the legislation establishing such official institutions.
.It would also be desirable to review the provisions of the Code concerning the types of trade unions which may be set up (section ), the number of members of the trade union who must be present at a general meeting in order to constitute a quorum (section  (f)), prohibition of the right to debate or take part in political affairs (section ), and cancellation of registration of trade unions by administrative authority (section ). All the above-mentioned provisions raise different problems which call for study by the Government. Recognising that the I.L.O has previously granted technical assistance to Paraguay in connection with labour legislation, the Committee hopes that, if the Government should require further technical assistance to examine these points, the I.L.O will do everything in its power to grant such assistance.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its interest in the recent adoption of the Labour Code and the Labour Disputes Procedure Code, in force from  February , which constitute a significant step forward in Paraguayan legislation as concerns the protection of freedom of association and trade union rights;(b) to express its satisfaction concerning the recent adoption of Act No.  whereby the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), is approved and ratified, and to express the hope that the Government will forward a formal instrument of ratification to the Director-General of the I.L.O at an early date, so that ratification may be duly registered;(c) to suggest to the Government that it may consider the advisability of further examining the provisions of the Labour Code and, in particular, the provisions mentioned in paragraphs  and  above, in order to bring them fully into conformity with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting on  February  the Committee continued its examination of this case, on which it had previously submitted an interim report to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and laid before the Governing Body the conclusions and recommendations which are contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. That report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.The only allegations on which the Committee had not submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body are certain allegations relating to the denial of trade union rights in Paraguay. The present report, therefore, is confined to the further consideration of these outstanding allegations.
.Paraguay has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee considers that, on the basis of the above legal text, and without more detailed information than it has as to what the trade union situation is in actual fact and as to how the legislation itself is applied in practice, it is not possible for it to express with certainty a conclusion as to how far the right of association can be exercised in freedom by the workers in Paraguay. The question would seem to depend in part on how certain of the legal provisions referred to above operate-especially section  (f) of Legislative Decree No.  which provides for control or supervision of trade unions by the Department of Labour and for the approval of their Constitutions and rules by the Department in agreement with the Executive Power; in the enactment forwarded there is no indication as to the criteria which have to be applied, for instance, in approving or disapproving the rules of a trade union, which would appear to indicate that approval is a matter within the discretion of the administrative authorities. In this connection the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has pointed out that the right of organisations to draw up their Constitutions and rules in freedom would appear to be considerably restricted in the case, for example, of countries in which Constitutions and rules must be submitted for previous approval by the authorities, whose power of decision does not appear to be limited by any specific rules."" Further, the Committee does not have before it any evidence as to how far means may exist whereby the exercise of the right of association of individual workers is protected and the free functioning and internal administration of workers' organisations is ensured.
.The Committee observes, however, that the Government states unequivocally that a draft labour code, which will provide for the right of association without previous authorisation and upon which the Government has received the advice of officials of the International Labour Office, is to be examined in the Legislative Congress during the present year.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement that a draft labour code, which will provide for the right of association without previous authorisation, is to be examined in Legislative Congress during the present year;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle that workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, should have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation; and to the principle that workers' and employers' organisations should have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; and also to the principle that workers' and employers' organisations should not be able to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(c) to urge the Government to ensure that full regard will be had in the draft legislation to be examined in the Legislative Congress to the principles enunciated in subparagraph (b) above and to the other generally accepted principles relating to freedom of association and trade union rights which are embodied in International Labour Conventions and, in particular, the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and that legislation giving full effect to the principles will be enacted at an early date;(d) to suggest to the Government that, when the legislation in question has been enacted, it may give consideration to ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. );(e) to request the Government to be good enough to keep the Governing Body informed as to further developments in connection with the draft labour code which is to be examined by the Legislative Congress of Paraguay this year.
.The complaint of the Confederation of Latin American Workers is contained in a communication dated  August . The Government presented observations on the complaint in a communication dated  June .
.When it examined the case at its meeting on  November , the Committee submitted its final conclusions to the",0,1957,Paraguay

The Committee presented an interim report on the remaining allegations-those relating to a police attack on an assembly of workers, to the detention of Mr. Insfrn, General Secretary of the Grau Union, and to denial of trade union rights-in respect of which it decided to request the Government to furnish further information. Further information was forwarded by the Government in a letter addressed to the Director-General of the I.L.O on  January .
