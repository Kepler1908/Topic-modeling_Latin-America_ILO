Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to annul those ministerial texts and their effects since they seriously violate the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining consecrated in Convention No. , and to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No.  is compatible with exclusively judicial control of the possible abusive character of certain clauses of collective agreements in the public sector. The Committee requests the competent authorities that, if it is wished to amend the result of collective bargaining in the public sector, they should wait until the expiry of the collective agreements and the respective employers should renegotiate their content with the trade union organizations.(e)\tThe Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the collective agreements, which were revised by administrative process, are renegotiated if the trade union organizations confirm the wish to do so.(f)\tThe Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of measures taken to give effect to the various recommendations formulated in this report and, noting the request of the complainant organizations, invites the Government to accept an ILO mission to assist in solving the problems observed in this case.(g)\tThe Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the communications from the CEOSL dated  March and  May .\n.In communications dated  May and  June , the FUT, the CEOSL, the CTE and the CEDOCUT confirm that the right to organize and collective bargaining of public sector workers has been restricted. The  Constituent Resolutions'  sui generis instruments not subject to the rules for the formation of a law, contain provisions which expressly establish that these bodies of law shall not be  open to complaint, challenge, action for protection (amparo), demand, claim, administrative or judicial opinion or judgement whatsoever'  There is no acceptable legal basis for this statement, which leaves workers whose rights have been expressly violated totally defenceless. The Constituent Assembly received a mandate from the people to prepare a new Constitution and change the country s institutional framework. The Assembly exceeded the powers bestowed upon it by the people when it issued those Constituent Resolutions, which through dictatorial action could become immutable instruments by virtue of the fact that they do not exist in the Ecuadorian legal system. In Constituent Resolution No. , the public authority, which is also the employer, unilaterally imposes the amendment and deletion of clauses or articles contained in collective agreements and contracts that have been negotiated and legally concluded, ignoring the principle of collective autonomy. Constituent Resolution No.  goes even further, expressly affirming that compensation for unfair dismissal set out in legally concluded collective agreements is also referred to. Constituent Resolution No.  provides that for the sake of fairness in work, it is necessary to revise and regulate the clauses of unreasonable and excessive collective agreements concluded by minority groups which run counter to the general interest and the workers themselves.\n.The complainant organizations reiterate that, if, hypothetically speaking, there were  excesses or privileges'  these must be amended in accordance with practice based on the Constitution, the international agreements and the Labour Code, i.e. through collective bargaining, but in no way through the arbitrary intervention of and imposition by the Government. The Constituent Resolutions remained in force until the approval of the new Constitution on  October  and all the regulations and standards issued by the executive authority and the Ministry of Labour and Employment (now the Ministry of Labour Relations) had to be coherent and in harmony with the provisions of the Constitution. Moreover, the Constitution and the ratified international human rights treaties prevail over any other legal standard or act of the public authorities. No provision is made in the legal hierarchy for the so-called  Constituent Resolutions' and any standards, precepts or provisions of the public authority that are contrary to the principles of the Constitution can be challenged before the Constitutional Court. The complainant organizations state that the new Constitution contains a tacit derogation of the Constituent Resolutions given that the derogating provision of the Constitution establishes that  any standard contrary to this Constitution ... shall be derogated. The rest of the legal order shall remain in force on the condition that it is not contrary to the Constitution.' Both the implementing regulation of Constituent Resolution No. , issued by the President of the Republic on  June , and Ministerial Order No.  issued by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, which refer to the revision of collective agreements in the public sector and the regulations covering the automatic adjustment and revision of the clauses of collective agreements are clearly contrary to the standards of the new Constitution and should therefore not be applied. However, the Government has arbitrarily and unilaterally revised collective agreements in the public sector.\n.The complainant organizations added that they opposed and protested against this arbitrary imposition by the Government. A number of officials left the meetings to which they had been convened as silent observers. Furthermore, in an effort to eliminate for good the most important rights of the workers set out in the collective agreements, on  April , the President of the Republic issued Executive Decree No.  stating that clauses contained in collective agreements which, in the President s view, contain  unreasonable privileges and benefits' should be deleted and prohibited. This Decree is unconstitutional and void because it was not issued within the time period set out by Constituent Resolution No. , i.e. one year from  March , the date on which the abovementioned Resolution was issued, and there was no social dialogue process. If the legal provisions and government practices described above remain in force, workers will no longer be able to achieve progress through the conclusion of collective agreements, the public authority will impose its will on trade union organizations and all of the rights and principles won during the course of the workers' struggle will be reduced to the level of frustrated demands.\n.Moreover, in a communication dated  May , the organizations of the National Coordinating Body of Public Trade Unions of Ecuador state that this situation puts the validity of collective bargaining, the right to work, employment stability and the existence of the right to organize in the public sector at risk, setting a dangerous precedent for organizations of the workers in the private sector. The Coordinating Body calls on the Government to open tripartite social dialogue, the appropriate mechanism for the resolution of differences and issues.\n.In a communication dated  August , FETRAPEC confirms the status of trade union official of the signatories of the complaint, including the four dismissed persons, providing certified copies of the records of the boards of the Federation and the work councils. The Federation adds that Executive Decree No.  of  April  reduces the conclusion of collective agreements in the public sector to a minimum. The preamble of the Decree refers to the fourth transitional provision of Constituent Resolution No. , which states the following:  The executive authority, in the course of social dialogue, within a period of one year, shall establish the criteria governing the conclusion of collective labour agreements in all public sector institutions ... .' FETRAPEC states that there was no social dialogue, least of all with the workers of the public sector covered by the process of the conclusion of collective agreements.\n.FETRAPEC highlights that the abovementioned Decree contains restrictions on trade union leave and eliminates employer contributions required for the conclusion of health insurance contracts. Public bodies are obliged to submit lists of personnel, stating staff members' responsibilities and activities, to the National Technical Secretariat for Human Resources Development and Public Sector Remuneration (SENRES). Furthermore, according to the Decree, the Secretariat  shall proceed to determine which workers shall be subject to the Labour Code or to the conclusion of collective agreements, as the case may be'  SENRES also has the power to establish the amounts of compensation paid to those opting for voluntary cessation of service with a view to retirement. FETRAPEC states that the process of determining whether workers shall be subject to the Labour Code or to the conclusion of collective agreements (as referred to above) carried out by SENRES serves two purposes: () the redefinition and downgrading of the worker s status, through the claim that the tasks that he carries out are purely or mainly manual rather than intellectual; () the redefinition of the employment relationship which occurs when a physical person continuously provides services for a public or private employer in a relationship of dependency or subordination and for remuneration. In the petroleum sector workers carry out tasks in both the administrative and operational sectors. Owing to the evolution of technology, there are technicians working in both sectors whose employment relationships are governed by the principle of reality, from both a factual and a legal point"", ""E.P. PETROECUADOR, have forfeited their legal personality by failing to renew their statutes when their employer became defunct, in accordance with the second transitory provision of Decree No. . The Government states that, in the light of these facts, FETRAPEC is not currently a representative organization, nor does it have legal personality.\n.As to recommendation (b), the Government states that the employment relationship of public officials who are subject to the regulations laid down in the Labour Code may be terminated by means of unfair dismissal, which is provided for in and regulated by section  of the Labour Code, which applies to workers in both the public and private sectors without distinction. Trade union members and officials do not fall under a special category of workers who enjoy privileges that other workers do not, just as unfair dismissal is not used to harm members of trade union movements. The Government states that, in Ecuador, a dismissal is only illegal when the worker is not compensated in accordance with the law, for which reason, no enterprise that has fulfilled the obligations set out in section  of the Labour Code is obliged to reinstate dismissed workers.\n.As to recommendation (c), the Government states that all the dismissed workers, of whom only a tiny percentage were trade union officials, were duly compensated in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. The Government reaffirms that none of the dismissals was anti-union in nature, as the Labour Code applies to all workers without distinction, and that trade union members and officials do not enjoy privileges that other workers do not, just as unfair dismissal is not used to harm members of trade union movements. Ecuadorian legislation does not consider the unilateral termination of an employment relationship to be illegal, provided that the worker is duly compensated. Furthermore, it should be noted that the current Government has approved three times more trade union organizations than other governments and that the proposed new Labour Code, which has been developed with the technical assistance of the ILO, guarantees the right to freedom of association by branch without interference from employers. These facts demonstrate the current Government s wholehearted support for the trade union movement in Ecuador.\n.As to recommendation (d) on the alleged violation of the collective agreement in force regarding compensation owed to workers who voluntarily ended their employment at the aforementioned enterprise, the Government states that the ruling of the National Court establishes that the workers who elected to end their employment voluntarily freely accepted their dismissal and signed the relevant severance agreement, thereby accepting the severance pay provided for therein. The Government indicates that, in the light of these facts, promoting dialogue between the enterprise and the workers as an alternative administrative measure to resolve the conflict is no longer necessary, given that the ruling of the national court has resolved the conflict through the judicial system, which has followed the correct procedure in accordance with the Constitution and the law.\n.As to recommendation (e) on the alleged dismissals at the Unidad Elctrica de Guayaquil enterprise and the ongoing criminal proceedings against the workers, the Government indicates that under Decree No. , issued by the President of the Republic and published in Official Journal No.  of  August , the then Board of the Temporary Electrical Power Administration of Guayaquil became the Unit for the Generation, Distribution and Commercialization of Electrical Energy of Guayaquil (Unidad Elctrica de Guayaquil), which, according to article  of the aforementioned Decree, comes under the authority of the Executive, which is part of the central public administration. In the light of these facts and with regard to the alleged dismissals, the Government states that, on the morning of Wednesday  November , the aforementioned Unidad Elctrica de Guayaquil workers arbitrarily stopped work for no legitimate reason and began shouting slogans against the authorities of the enterprise. According to the Government, it became clear from the numerous press articles on the incident that the workers had even resorted to the unauthorized use of automobiles to block the entrances to the enterprise s premises in order to carry out the stoppage. It should be noted that those automobiles are public property and should only be used for work purposes. The Government states that, in this way, the workers endangered the safety and physical integrity of all the persons present at that time by committing acts that are expressly prohibited by section , paragraphs (a) and (b), of the Labour Code. In the light of these facts and as is reflected in the documentation in the possession of the Guayaquil Department of the Ministry of Labour Relations, the dismissals were approved in accordance with the third reason listed in section  of the Labour Code, which led the labour inspector, who was acting on behalf of the administrative authority and using the powers conferred on him by section , paragraph , of the Labour Code, to approve the dismissal of the workers in question.\n.As to recommendation (f), the Government indicates that Ministerial Order No. , published in Official Journal No.  of  August , was issued with the aim of automatically adjusting the clauses of the collective agreements in question to ensure their compliance with the provisions of Constituent Resolution No. . The aforementioned ministerial order is understood as being an instrument for regulating the transition from the former collective agreements in place prior to Constituent Resolution No.  to ensure their compliance with its provisions. Therefore, the ministerial order has served its purpose, is final and complies with Ecuadorian legislation without violating the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No.  for the reasons detailed below. Ecuador respects the principles enshrined in Convention No.  and has on no occasion prohibited free collective bargaining, rather it has regularized such bargaining so that it takes place within the framework of established parameters, which are in keeping with the limitations of the State of Ecuador, its fiscal budget and its constitutional principles, such as those established in article  of the Constitution, which provides that:  At all levels of Government, public funds shall be managed in a sustainable, responsible and transparent manner and shall seek to achieve economic stability. Permanent expenditure shall be funded with permanent sources of income. Permanent expenditure on health care, education and the judicial system shall take priority and, in exceptional circumstances, shall be funded with non-permanent sources of income'  In this connection, the Government also refers to Ministerial Order No. A, which was published in Official Journal No.  of  October  and lays down the regulations for revising collective labour agreements, in accordance with the provisions of Constituent Resolution No. , but which does not prevent free collective bargaining, provided that it takes place within the established parameters and is in keeping with the principle enshrined in article  of the Constitution and the principles of equality and transparency. Ministerial Order No. A also seeks to ensure equal pay for equal work in the public sector by respecting differences but not excesses and privileges, which cannot be sustained by the budget of the State of Ecuador and which undermine the principle of equity. Thus, Ministerial Order No. A is also final and complies with Ecuadorian legislation.\n.As to the Committee s request for the Government to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No.  is compatible with an exclusively judicial control, the Government states that the fourth transitory provision of Constituent Resolution No.  provides that the Executive that shall be responsible for establishing the criteria that shall govern the collective labour agreements of all public sector institutions, and that the third transitory provision of the regulations governing the application of Constituent Resolution No.  provides that the Ministry of Labour shall lay down the regulations and procedures for revising the aforementioned collective labour agreements and that  judges, courts and the administrative authorities shall enforce this provision' \n.The Committee recalls that the allegations that were still pending in this case related to union dues being returned to the workers who are members of FETRAPEC; to the adoption of legislation that was contrary to trade union independence and the right to bargain collectively; and to the dismissal of trade unionists [see th Report, para. ].\n.As to the recommendation requesting the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the trade union dues are immediately returned to the workers who are members of FETRAPEC, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement to the effect that the Ministry of Labour Relations has taken note of the recommendation and undertakes to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the union dues are returned to the members of FETRAPEC, and to inform the Committee of the progress made towards that end. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in that regard.\n.As to the recommendation requesting the Government to encourage without delay the initiation of discussions between FETRAPEC and the"", ""considers it essential that there will be legislation to ensure that in the future certain  excesses' of  abuses' are avoided, but questions whether the amendments have been in accordance with normal and rational practice, i.e. through collective bargaining, and that resort was made instead to the subjective and arbitrary government authority through public officials. The Committee observes that the complainant organization emphasizes that nowhere in Constituent Resolution No.  does it state that the revising commission (of collective agreements) is composed solely of officials of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. That was defined, emphasizes FETRAPEC, by the Ministry of Labour and Employment in Ministerial Order No. , which grants discretionary powers to that commission and excludes any administrative or judicial appeal; the  contributions' of workers' organizations and the employer, according to that order, will be appraised by the commission applying the principle of  healthy criticism' \n.To the extent that this case involves legal instruments (Constituent Resolutions, regulations, ministerial orders) which affect conditions of work, the Committee wishes to emphasize the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. The Committee highlights that it is important that consultations take place in good faith, confidence and mutual respect, and that the parties have sufficient time to express their views and discuss them in full with a view to reaching a suitable compromise [see Digest, op. cit., fifth edition, , para. ]. In the present case, nothing indicates either the Government s statements or the content of the legal texts to which the complainants object, that in-depth consultations were held in advance and allowing sufficient time with the workers' organizations concerned (which deplore the unilateral nature of the legal instruments in question) and for that reason, the Committee requests the Government in future to take into account the aforementioned principles in order, as far as possible, to reach shared solutions.\n.As regards the provisions in the Constituent Resolutions which set a cap on remuneration in the public sector (No. ), compensation for unfair dismissal and other causes of termination of the employment relation (No.  and No. ) or prohibit supplementary private pension schemes which involve contributions of State resources (Executive Decree No.  of  October , which provides that State resources shall not be contributed to funds of a private nature), the Committee does not doubt the expressed will of the Government to look after the general interest, ensure equality, avoid unreasonable excesses in collective agreements and ensure financial and budgetary balance, but wishes to emphasize that these are permanent and unalterable limitations on the right of collective bargaining of workers' organizations incompatible with Convention No. , which provides for free and voluntary bargaining of conditions of work and if the Government wishes to pursue a policy which seeks those objectives which, moreover, are legitimate, it can do so in the framework of collective bargaining without resorting to impositions which limit the content of bargaining by the parties to that bargaining. The Committee recalls that limitations on the free determination of wages in collective bargaining are only acceptable in exceptional circumstances. In this respect, the Committee has indicated that  If, as part of its stabilization policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee has taken the view that the parties involved in collective bargaining can improve the legal provisions on pensions [see rd report, Case No. , para. ].\n.Furthermore, the Committee recalls the principle that repeated recourse to legislative restrictions on collective bargaining can only, in the long term, prejudice and destabilize the labour relations climate if the legislator frequently intervenes to suspend or terminate the exercise of rights recognized for unions and their members. Moreover, this may have a detrimental effect on workers' interests in unionization, since members and potential members could consider useless joining an organization, the main objective of which is to represent its members in collective bargaining, if the results of such bargaining are constantly cancelled by law [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee also recalls that the right to bargain freely with employers with respect to conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and trade unions should have the right, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to seek to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent. The public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. Any such interference would appear to infringe the principle that workers' and employers' organizations should have the right to organize their activities and to formulate their programmes [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.The Committee has considered that measures taken unilaterally by the authorities to restrict the scope of negotiable issues are often incompatible with Convention No. ; tripartite discussions for the preparation, on a voluntary basis, of guidelines for collective bargaining are a particularly appropriate method of resolving these difficulties [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.In particular, the Committee also emphasizes the principle that the reservation of budgetary powers to the legislative authority should not have the effect of preventing compliance with collective agreements entered into by, or on behalf of, that authority [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.The Committee requests the Government to restore the right of collective bargaining on conditions of work and living standards of workers and to inform it accordingly.\n.With respect to the alleged declaration of absolute nullity or the imposition of the revision of clauses of collective agreements by administrative means (in those cases where the administrative authority considers that the clauses of such agreements contain excesses and unreasonable privileges which conflict with the general interest in the numerous cases listed indicatively in Constituent Resolution No.  and its regulations for application), the Committee observes that the administrative procedure is regulated by Ministerial Order No.  and Order No. A, both of the Ministry of Labour. The Committee emphasizes that control of clauses of public sector agreements for possible abuse should not be up to the administrative authority, since it cannot be both judge and party, but a matter for the judicial authority, and then only in extremely serious cases, and not for just any significant benefit which has been agreed. The Committee therefore requests the Government that control of allegedly abusive clauses of collective agreements should only be carried out through the courts, so as to ensure impartiality, the right of defence and due process. The Committee observes that in the present case, the decisions of the administrative authorities are not subject to any appeal whatsoever, whether administrative or judicial and considers that the current regulations, especially the instruments of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, which allow it unilaterally to declare void or reduce a wide range of clauses of collective agreements, is a serious violation of the principle of free and voluntary bargaining. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to annul those ministerial texts and their effects and to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No.  is compatible with exclusively judicial control (not administrative) of the possible abusive character of certain clauses of collective agreements in the public sector. The Committee requests the authorities that, if it is wished to amend the result of collective bargaining, it should wait until the expiry of the collective agreements and the respective employers should renegotiate their content with the trade union organizations.\n.More specifically, with respect to the revision of the clauses of the collective agreements of the Petroecuador company and its subsidiaries and the health sector, by decision of the commission on the revisions of collective agreements in the public sector, the Committee notes the excesses of some of the clauses highlighted by the Government, and that the complainant organization FETRAPEC implicitly recognizes some excesses in certain clauses. The Committee considers that, in conformity with the principles and considerations expressed in the foregoing paragraphs, the revisions made by the Ministry of Labour and Employment should be cancelled. The Committee understands that the FETRAPEC organizations would be disposed to engage in renegotiation with their employers and that this would probably also be the case in the health sector, where, for example, the clause on working hours and days, and other clauses, were declared void.\n.The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that these collective agreements are renegotiated if the trade union organizations confirm the wish to do so.\n.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of measures taken to give effect to its recommendations and, noting the request of the complainant organizations, invites the Government to""]"

Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton, and to request it once more to indicate the present position of Mr. Julio Ayala Serra;(c) to draw attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  with respect to strikes in the teaching profession and the dissolution of the National Union of Educators (UNE), and to request the Government to reconsider the measure taken against the UNE, which is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  (ratified by Ecuador), and supply information on any development in this connection;(d) to take note of this interim report.\n.The complaints are contained in two communications, one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), dated  July , and the other from the World Federation of Trade Unions, dated  July . The CPUSTAL supplied additional information in a letter dated  August . The Government forwarded its observations by a communication dated  September . On  October  the International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions submitted a complaint concerning which the Government has not yet transmitted its observations.\n.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The CPUSTAL alleged that the Police Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of non-existent laws, had pronounced judgement sentencing to two years' imprisonment, and fines of from , to , sucres, the President of the Confederation of Workers of Ecuador (CTE), Juan Vasquez Bastidas, and the President of the National Union of Educators (UNE), Manuel Anton. These organisations are members of the CPUSTAL. The complainants added that these persons had not been given any sort of trial.\n.The WFTU stated that the three Ecuadorian trade union Confederations - the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL - had organised, on  May , a -hour national strike in support of a claim for higher wages and other demands of an economic and social nature. The UNE, which has a membership of , teachers, called a work stoppage on the same day with a view to obtaining a salary rise and an increase in the national education budget. In response, added the WFTU, the Government issued a decree, No. , conferring upon police intendants the status of special judges competent to try trade union officials and strikers under an expeditious procedure with no right of appeal. At the same time the Government instructed these police intendants to bring to trial the principal leaders of the three Confederations that had organised the national strike of  May, as well as officials of the UNE.\n.Furthermore, continued the complainants, the Supreme Council of Government issued on  May  a decree outlawing the UNE and providing for the custodianship of its funds. At the end of June, the General Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of the aforementioned Decree No. , sentenced Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton to fines and imprisonment. The WFTU further mentioned the arrest of Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guays who was to be tried under the same procedure.\n.The Government, in a detailed reply to which were appended a large number of documents, emphasised that it was its policy to encourage the trade union movement in Ecuador. As evidence of this it pointed to the subsidy of , sucres that it paid to the country's trade union Confederations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, to cover the expenses of the  May rally. However, it continued, the leaders of these three Confederations had taken advantage of the opportunity afforded by this event - in which the majority of the participants had no connection with the trade union movement - to incite the workers to take part in a national work stoppage on  May , based on a combat manifesto of nine points, not all of which related to industrial matters, and which were refuted one by one. Moreover, none of these demands had been put to the competent authorities through the proper legal channels.\n.In the appendices to the Government's reply there was a list of these points and the arguments whereby the Government refuted them. These demands were as follows:\n.The Government stated that the union leaders were allowed to prepare for the work stoppage in full freedom. They had access to the radio, television and the press at the national level. The Government further pointed out that it had recognised the workers' organisations without reservations. However, it could not fail in its moral and legal duty to preserve public order and ensure that citizens could live their lives normally in every respect. It could only condemn incitement to disorderly conduct and anarchy, whoever was responsible, and any attempt to undermine the functioning of the State by disregarding the procedures in force for dealing with all grievances, individual or collective. In substance, the Government enforced the regulations in force to defend its stability and ensure the preservation of public order and the safety of persons and property. It was these duties that the Government was performing in dealing with the events of  May .\n.The Government refuted the complainants' allegations completely. It claimed that these complaints were unfounded and did not mention a single specific case of infringement of the freedom of association Conventions. All persons living on the territory of a State, added the Government, were required to observe the laws of that country. Under Legislative Decree No.  of  June , the instigators of a collective stoppage of work, and the ringleaders of such a stoppage, were liable to a fine of from , to , sucres and from two to five years' imprisonment. Persons who participated in such a work stoppage without having instigated it or being a ringleader were liable to a fine of from  to , sucres and from three months' to one year's imprisonment. A work stoppage within the meaning of this legislative decree was deemed to occur where there was a collective cessation of activity, where establishments were forcibly closed other than in the circumstances provided for by law, and in the event of paralysis of channels of communication or other anti social acts. These provisions had the force of a special Act and had precedence over those of general Acts which were contrary to them.\n.The strike of  May , continued the Government, had been prepared, inter alia, by Juan Vasquez Bastidas, Emilio Velasco and Jos Chvez Chvez, officials of one or other of the workers' associations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, while other unions (bearing the same initials) had refused to be associated with the stoppage and had condemned it as an act of treason by the rank and file, requesting the support of the authorities to enable them to carry on with their daily work. The above-mentioned persons, in instigating the strike, had contravened Legislative Decree No .\n.This Legislative Decree, added the Government, was supplemented by Presidential Decree No. , which specified the competent judicial authority and guarantees the rights of defendants. There accordingly existed a judicial institution, established by the State, to mete out punishment in the case of work stoppages and strikes organised unlawfully. The Government appended the text of this decree, adopted on  May . Section  confers upon general police intendants the status of special judges competent to deal with and pronounce judgement upon offences in connection with collective work stoppages; they must impose the penalties prescribed in Legislative Decree No. . Section  states that the procedure is to be that prescribed in section  of the Code of Criminal Procedure; sections , ,  and  of that Code are likewise to be observed. Section  specifies that special judges may, either on their own initiative or at the request of any administrative or judicial authority, take up a case and try the persons held to be criminally responsible for a collective work stoppage.\n.The judgements handed down in respect of Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton, concluded the Government, had been pronounced in accordance with the legal rules in force in the country and the penalties had been imposed by the legally competent authority. There could, therefore, be no question as to the validity of their conviction.\n.This case is mainly concerned with the general strike called on  May  by the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL and another strike organised on the same day by the UNE. This work stoppage resulted in the sentencing, under an emergency procedure, of trade union leaders including Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton. The complainants also mention the arrest of another trade union leader, Julio Ayala Serra, and the outlawing of the UNE, but the Government has made no observations on the latter two points.\n.As already pointed out by the Committee, Article  of Convention No.  recognises the right of trade union organisations"", '.In a communication dated  September , the ICFTU submitted a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Ecuador. The complainant organisation provided additional information in support of its complaint in a communication of  November .\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  October  and  January .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise in Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).\n.In its complaint, the ICFTU explains that its affiliate organisation in Ecuador, the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organisations (CEOSL), organised, together with other national trade union confederations, a peaceful  hour strike on  September  with a view to doubling the basic subsistence wage and condemning the Government\'s economic and social policy. Fifteen trade unionists were arrested on that day, including Julio Chang Crespo, Secretary-General of the CEOSL and member of the Executive Committee of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (ORIT), a regional organisation belonging to the ICFTU. The ICFTU states that it supports its affiliate organisation\'s claims for wage increases and the repeal of governmental economic and social measures.\n.Together with its communication of  November , the ICFTU encloses a report from its affiliate, the CEOSL, on the causes which gave rise to the national general strike called by the Ecuadorian trade union movement and the course it took. The CEOSL explains in this document that the Government has carried out a policy aimed at giving a boost to exporters of agricultural products, banks and large undertakings at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises, resulting in the worsening of the social and economic situation of the majority of the population. This policy has brought about, for instance, price increases in stable commodities, public services (transport, electricity, water and telephones) and medicines, the freezing of budgetary expenditure for education and an increase in unemployment and underemployment.\n.According to the CEOSL, the Government systematically infringes Conventions Nos.  and  and the right to strike. For example, it refuses to register trade union executives which have been democratically and legally elected and to approve the rules of new organisations by laying down administrative requirements not stipulated by law. The CEOSL quotes the case of several trade unions who have been confronted with such difficulties (the Ecuadorian Railway Workers Union, the Works\' Council of Cubiertas and Mzov S.A., the Federation of Free Workers in the Ecuadorian Sugar Sector, the Santa Elena Agricultural Workers\' Trade Union).\n.As regards collective bargaining, the CEOSL states that collective agreements are not applied either in the public or in the private sector; bargaining is obstructed and agreements negotiated with public undertakings or bodies are challenged by the Ministry of Finance. In many cases, according to the CEOSL, strikers are subjected to police repression although the strikes have been called in strict conformity with the law.\n.The CEOSL also points out that the Executive does not apply the decisions adopted by the National Congress. For instance, the Government submitted a Bill to increase wages by , sucres per month (equivalent to  US dollars ) accompanied by a tax programme to finance the wage increase. The Congress refused this Bill on the grounds that the increase was derisory. The Executive nevertheless, implemented this Bill, refusing to apply the Congress\'s decision to increase wages by , sucres per month (equivalent to . US dollars).\n.According to the CEOSL, the President of the Republic also approved an Executive Decree restricting the right to call solidarity strikes, which is contrary to Ecuadorian law. This Decree, of which the CEOSL provides a copy, limits solidarity strikes to five days, stipulating that they may not be called upon more than twice in one year by workers in the same undertaking. The CEOSL has lodged an appeal against this Decree with the Tribunal of Constitutional Guarantees.\n.In these circumstances, the national trade union confederations called a national strike on  September , in which wide sectors of the economy throughout the country took part. This movement was harshly put down by the police which, according to the CEOSL, arrested about  workers.\n.The CEOSL headquarters were also brutally attacked by the police and the trade unionists inside were dealt blows.\n.In its communications of  and  October , the Government states that Julio Chang Crespo, mentioned in the ICFTU\'s complaint, was arrested on  September  and sentenced to two-days\' imprisonment for breach of the peace and not for having exercised the right to strike, which is legally recognised. The person in question was released on  September and, two days later, left the country to attend a trade union meeting being held in Buenos Aires.\n.The Government adds that strikes linked to industrial disputes are protected by the Ecuadorian legal system but that, on the other hand, collective work stoppages and political strikes are specifically banned by Act No.  adopted by the National Assembly in . Under this Act, a collective work stoppage is defined as being the collective cessation of activity, the imposing of a lock-out outside the cases allowed by law, the paralysis of lines of communication and other similar anti-social occurrences. The instigators and authors of such stoppages are liable to a fine of , to , sucres and to two- to five-years\' imprisonment; those taking part in the work stoppage are liable to a fine of  to , sucres and to three-months\' to one-year\'s imprisonment. In its communications issued before the strike, the Government informed the population that this Act was still fully in force.\n.In the text of the sentence handed down by the Sixth Police Court on the persons arrested on  September , it is stated that those concerned took part in demonstrations not authorised by the police, which disrupted law and order and blocked the public highway, and that they shouted protests against the Government and public officials. In accordance with section , paragraph  of the Penal Code, they were sentenced to two days\' imprisonment.\n.The Government also encloses press cuttings containing statements by the Minister of Labour to the effect that the strike of  September was of a political nature and attempted to destabilise the regime.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government considers that the critisisms levelled by the complainants at the economic and social policy conducted in Ecuador are merely subjective statements of an arbitrary nature and divorced from reality. Admittedly, like many developing countries, Ecuador is undergoing a crisis, but the Government is attempting to ensure that the nation overcomes it unscathed and with the least social and political consequences. It is incumbent upon the public authorities to guarantee peace in the country and uphold national law and order.\n.The Government strongly denies the allegation that, by controlling the seditious actions of  September, it infringed ILO Conventions Nos.  and . It widely respects trade union rights and guarantees the exercise of these rights provided that this is lawful and moral and does not infringe legislation or disrupt law and order. The ""general strike"" of  September, wrongly described as ""peaceful"", was neither of a social nor trade union nature but was a seditious act: groups of rioters set up barricades in the streets and on the highways, caused fires, attacked members of the police force and private and official vehicles, damaged private property and injured individuals. The Government was prudent in the way it controlled the situation. Only several people actually instigating the disturbances or involved in violent action were arrested after being caught in the act. These agitators, who were imprisoned, were immediately released once the disturbances had ended and after serving a very short sentence of two-days\' imprisonment, in accordance with the penalties for offences laid down in the Penal Code. The only reason behind all the international proceedings was therefore to prolong a meticulously organised scandal and to exaggerate the importance of incidents brought rapidly brought under control. According to the Government, even an opposition paper described the general strike as being political. Furthermore, the Government points out that the so-called ""evidence"" of the ""repression"" carried out by the Government consists of cuttings from this same opposition paper.\n.The Government quotes several articles from the National Constitution: article , which lays down the functions and duties of the President of the Republic, including the upholding of national law and order, the use of the police force when security and public services warrant this and the declaration of the national state of emergency; article , which states that the role of the police force is to uphold national sovereignty, defend the integrity and independence of the nation and to guarantee its judicial system. The Government also provides a copy of the provisions of the Penal Code pertaining to offences against national state security. The Government points out that the rights of the individual and of society are protected by Ecuadorian legislation, in particular by Title II of the Constitution, of which it provides a copy.\n.The Government adds that', 'led to the sentencing, under an emergency procedure, to fines and imprisonment of trade union officials including Juan Vasquez Bastidas, President of the CTE, and Manuel Anton, President of the UNE. The World Federation of Trade Unions also referred to the arrest of Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators\' Union for the province of Guays, and the outlawing of the UNE, but the Government had made no observations on the latter two points.\n.The Committee noted that a number of the demands made in connection with the strike of  May  were clearly occupational in character, while others were not. As concerns the claims of an economic nature, the Committee pointed out that the right to strike should not be restricted solely to industrial disputes likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement; workers and their organisations should be allowed to express in a broader context, if they so wished, any dissatisfaction they might feel as concerns economic and social matters affecting their members\' interests, so long as such action consisted merely in the expression of a protest and was not intended as a breach of the peace.\n.Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton had been given heavy sentences - two years\' imprisonment and fines of from , to , sucres, according to the complainants - as a result of the strike of  May , in pursuance of Legislative Decree No.  of  June  and Presidential Decree No.  of  May . The first of these decrees punishes severely and in very broad terms collective stoppages of work. The Committee expressed the opinion that it should be reviewed. The second, adopted only a few days after the strike in question, entrusts senior police officers with the responsibility of trying offenders; the sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which it refers apply in principle to minor breaches of the law; they provide for an expeditious procedure with no possibility of appeal. The Committee expressed the view that this summary procedure lent itself to abuse, and that all arrested trade unionists should be subject to normal judicial procedure guaranteeing the rights of defence and conforming to the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, requested the Government to review Legislative Decree No.  and to consider the repeal of Presidential Decree No. , and requested the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to follow developments in this connection. The Governing Body also suggested to the Government the possibility of reconsidering the position of Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton. It requested the Government to indicate the present position of Julio Ayala Serra and to forward its observations with respect to the outlawing of the UNE.\n.The International Federation of Free Teachers\' Unions (IFFTU) also referred in its letter of  October  to the industrial action taken by teachers with a view to obtaining a pay increase. It alleged that the Government had immediately reacted by applying Decrees Nos.  and , with the result that the UNE was dissolved and its national and regional leaders were jailed. They were sentenced to fines of from , to , sucres ( to  United States dollars) and struck off the register of teachers forthwith, along with  of their colleagues. In a letter dated  November , primarily concerned with another aspect of the trade union situation in Ecuador, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions mentioned these two decrees, which had, inter alia, resulted in the outlawing of the UNE (Decree No. ) and facilitated individual and ,collective dismissals, and the threatening, arrest or even murder of trade unionists.\n.The Government explains, in its two communications, that the UNE\'s membership embraces a substantial proportion of the teachers in the country\'s public educational system. Contrary to the most elementary principles governing relations between the State and its servants, these teachers decided to call a national work stoppage with a view to obtaining certain pecuniary advantages which the Government was not in a position to offer them. Nevertheless, continues the Government, the authorities studied these demands in a desire to satisfy them as far as possible. Notwithstanding this, on the initiative of a few of its leaders, the UNE launched itself into a national strike which brought public schools and colleges throughout the country to a standstill for  days with the sole aim of creating chaos, disrupting public order and attempting to shatter the peace and tranquillity of the Ecuadorian people.\n.This strike was qualified as illegal, adds the Government, by dozens of their fellow teachers who did not share the views of the majority. Moreover, the authorities reached the conclusion after several meetings with the leaders that this was merely a campaign to enlist sympathy for a few teachers who were bad servants of the State. The Government, accordingly, declares these events to be unlawful and tendentious under the terms of the law. The teaching profession is in fact governed by the Advancement and Wages Act, which enumerates the rights and duties which bind teachers to the State and prohibits strikes, work stoppages and other demonstrations of a political nature. Teachers are public servants and may not infringe the provisions of the law. They are protected by laws which are different from the national labour legislation. Consequently, the Government does not consider that it has infringed Conventions Nos.  and , which apply to workers covered by the Labour Code and not to public servants, such as teachers, who have a public and social function to perform - in this instance, the education of the country\'s children and adolescents. The Government adds that in pursuance of the aforementioned Legislative Decree No. , it punished the ringleaders by dismissing them or transferring them to other provinces. However, it immediately quashed these sanctions and reinstated  per cent of the teachers in their profession, in some cases in the same post. The competent authorities are examining the cases of the remainder with a view to their reinstatement.\n.The Committee notes this information, and in particular that concerning the reinstatement of teachers in their profession. It wishes, first of all, to recall that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers, ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the \'State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category should be permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests.\n.Nevertheless, as was made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No. , the recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. The Committee has admitted that this right could be restricted or even prohibited in the civil service. However, as the Committee has pointed out in a number of cases involving teachers in the public educational system, such measures should be accompanied by adequate procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes and, in the final instance, arbitration procedures in which the awards would be binding in all cases upon both parties and would be promptly and fully implemented.\n.Following this strike, the Government outlawed the UNE in pursuance of a decree, which was tantamount to dissolving this organisation. In this connection, Article  of Convention No.  provides that workers\' and employers\' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved (or suspended) by administrative authority. The Committee has often pointed out that dissolution by the executive branch of the Government pursuant to a law conferring full powers or in the exercise of legislative functions, like dissolution by virtue of administrative powers, does not afford the right of defence and does not offer the necessary guarantees. In other words, trade unions should enjoy the protection of a normal judicial procedure where the national legislation provides for the dissolution (or suspension) of a trade union as a punishment for a serious breach of the law.\n.The Committee recalls that in an earlier case relating Ecuador the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, inter alia drew the Government\'s attention to the aforementioned principle embodied in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Ecuador, and urged that full effect be given to it. In the present case, there is also a risk that the outlawing of the UNE will deprive teachers in the public educational sector of any representative organisation, since, in the Government\'s own words, its membership embraces a substantial proportion of the teachers concerned.\n.The Government has supplied no further information with respect to Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas, Manuel Anton and Julio Ayala Serra.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the information supplied by the Government concerning the reinstatement of the teachers dismissed for going on strike;(b) to suggest again to the Government that it reconsider the position']"

The Committee also reiterates its previous conclusions and requests the Government once again to take the necessary measures to annul or amend the abovementioned Ministerial Orders and to keep it informed in that regard.(e)\tAs to the alleged mass dismissals that took place in the enterprise E.P. PETROECUADOR in  and , the Committee requests the Government to send without delay detailed information on these allegations and its observations on the alleged anti-union nature of the dismissals.(f)\tWithout putting into question the deadlines mentioned by the Government, or the statute of limitations, the Committee highlights the importance of the issues raised ' violation of the collective agreement in force and non-compliant compensation ' and requests the Government to promote dialogue between the CTE and the enterprise with a view to finding a solution to this dispute.(g)\tAs to the alleged dismissals at the enterprise Unidad Elctrica de Guayaquil and the ongoing criminal proceedings against the workers, the Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not responded and urges it to do so without delay.\n.The complaint is contained in communications from the National Federation of Workers of the State Petroleum Enterprise of Ecuador (FETRAPEC), Public Services International (PSI) and the Single Trade Union Organization of Health Ministry Workers (OSUNTRAMSA) dated, respectively,  November ,  December  and  February . FETRAPEC sent additional information in a communication dated  January . Subsequently, recent communications from the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organizations (CEOSL) dated  March and  May  have been received and were transmitted to the Government.\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  January,  February and  March .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations (FETRAPEC, PSI and OSUNTRAMSA) allege, on the one hand, the arbitrary and unfair dismissal of four trade union officials in the petroleum sector (Messrs Edgar de la Cueva, Ramiro Guerrero, Jhon Plaza Garay and Diego Cano Molestina) and, on the other, the issue of  Constituent Resolutions' and legal instruments derived therefrom which gave rise to various limitations on collective bargaining and the declaration of nullity or unilateral amendment by the authorities of clauses of collective agreements in the public sector through procedures in which the trade unions were merely heard and in which the administrative authority decided without any possibility of administrative or judicial appeal.\n.The Committee observes that the Government objects to the receivability of the complaint presented by FETRAPEC on the basis that: () the complainants ' the five signatories of the complaint by FETRAPEC ' did not submit evidence of the appointments accrediting them as trade union officials; () Mr Diego Cano Molestina who, according to the complaint, acts as President of the National Federation of Petroecuador Workers, no longer works for the Petroecuador company; () this person has not shown that he is a representative of all the unionized workers in the public sector, for which reason his complaint accompanied by the signature of the other three supposed trade union officials is null and void; () the complaint is not supported by a national federation of Ecuadorian workers constituted and registered pursuant to the constitutional and legal provisions that allow such registration; () the termination of the employment relations of the four supposed trade union officials is not arbitrary because it is supported in law in the constitutional principle of freedom to contract and it was in accordance with the Labour Code, the collective agreement and the General Regulations pursuant to the Special Act concerning Petroecuador and its subsidiaries, from which it can be concluded that at any time the employment relation may be terminated unilaterally, and all the legal compensation due to those four persons had been paid; () those regulations attribute to the Petroecuador company responsibility for the management and safeguarding of the interests of the subsidiary, to evaluate the management performance of their institution and its employees, all in relation to the activities specific to the fields of professional activity; and () the court refused the appeal for constitutional protection filed by one of the alleged trade union officials, Mr Edgar de la Cueva (the Government attaches the judgement).\n.The Committee wishes to point out that in any case the question of receivability of FETRAPEC s complaint has been overtaken by events with regard to the allegations relating to the Constituent Resolutions and the legal instruments derived from them, since the other complainant organizations (PSI and OSUNTRAMSA) support FETRAPEC s complaint or explicitly express the same concerns and ask the Committee to pronounce on the texts in question.\n.As regards the question of the receivability of FETRAPEC s complaint concerning the dismissal of four (alleged according to the Government) trade union officials, the Committee observes that in the judgement sent by the Government on the application for protection (amparo) filed by one of those persons (Mr Edgar de la Cueva, one of the signatories of the complaint to the Committee) with respect to his unfair dismissal, his status of trade union official is mentioned on several occasions without the defendant, the Petroproduccin company, denying or objecting to it. Furthermore, the application mentions anti-trade union reprisals as a consequence of a press release in the name and representation of the trade union organization establishing guidelines for the definition of petroleum policy and complaints against the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum. The application was refused for reasons of form (failure previously to exhaust the ordinary legal remedies). Nevertheless, given that the Government has raised the question of the receivability of the complaint, making it subject to evidence of the status of trade union official of the signatories of the complaint (four of them dismissed), the Committee requests FETRAPEC to confirm the status of trade union official of the signatories of the complaint, including the dismissed persons, for example, by sending the minutes of the general meeting in which they were elected by their trade union organization, grass-roots union or federation. In turn, the Committee requests the Government to indicate: () whether the consideration that the four dismissed persons were not trade union officials was related to their dismissal, which might have made them lose that status under Ecuadorian legislation, and () the  specific facts' which motivated the dismissal of those four persons, as it would appear from the Government s reply that they were dismissed unilaterally and without any indication of the grounds. The Committee also requests the Government to communicate the sanctions set out in the legislation in the case of arbitrary and unjustified dismissals of trade unionists. The Committee recalls paragraph  of its procedures, whereby the Committee has not regarded any complaint as being irreceivable simply because the government in question had dissolved, or proposed to dissolve, the organization on behalf of which the complaint was made, or because the person or persons making the complaint had taken refuge abroad.\n.Returning to the question of the Constituent Resolutions and the legal instruments derived from them, to which the complainant organizations object, in that they allege they declare the nullity or impose amendments of clauses of collective agreements in force in the public sector through procedures in which the complainant organizations are merely  heard' and in which decisions are taken by the administrative authority without the possibility of any administrative or legal appeal, the Committee indicates that the relevant provisions of the texts in question, attached by the complainant organizations and the Government, are reproduced in the annex to the present report.\n.The Committee notes the Government s statements according to which: () the revision of the collective agreements in the public sector, which contained excesses and privileges, was an aspiration and desire of large sections of the population and the response of the public at large was total approval and acceptance of the revision process being undertaken by the Ministry of Labour and Employment in relation to clauses which contain unreasonable and excessive privileges which conflicted with the general interest; the Government gives specific examples relating to collective agreements in the petroleum sector, amply described in its reply, for example, the voluntary separation of the worker in the Petroecuador company gave rise to contributions ranging from US$, to US$,; () these clauses (of the nature indicated in Constituent Resolution No.  and its regulations for application) are merely indicative; () the Constituent Resolutions have a supra-constitutional character and may not be derogated or the subject of claims of unconstitutionality in the Constitutional Court; () collective bargaining in the public sector is subject to the existence of the economic resources to finance it and, had the collective agreements of Petroecuador been maintained, that would have led to its liquidation to the detriment of  million Ecuadorians; and () the reforms concerned were carried out in full respect for the legal order.\n.The Committee observes that the complainant organization FETRAPEC does not deny that there may be excesses and"", 'is based on rumours which, it points out, have not been substantiated by the complainant. The Committee invites the complainant to provide additional information in this respect.\n.At the same time, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the cases concerning the death of the police officer Jos Geover Bowen and the deaths of other persons during the demonstrations held in connection with the general strike of  October  (Mr. Jorge Anbal Mena and Mr. Javier Bone Roa) have been brought before the courts. The Committee deeply regrets these deaths and requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial inquiry.\n.As regards developments in the investigations into the death of the trade union official Sal Caar Pauta, the Committee notes the findings which the Government has passed on to the Committee. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in the judicial inquiry and to inform it of the results as soon as they are given.\n.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee invites the complainant to provide additional information concerning the allegation of training by paramilitaries of  Ecuadorian nationals with a view to launching an attack on social activists.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any progress made in the judicial inquiry into the death of the trade union official Mr. Sal Caar Pauta and to inform it of the results as soon as they are given.(c) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the investigations into the deaths of Mr. Jos Geover Bowen (police officer) and of Mr. Jorge Anbal Mena and Mr. Javier Bone Roa (demonstrators) during the demonstrations held in connection with the general strike of  October .\n.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  February . The Government sent its observations in communications dated ,  and  March,  April and  May .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  February , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) points out that it has been informed of the disappearance and subsequent murder of Sal Caar Pauta, national secretary of issues related to population and youth of the Ecuadorian Confederation of United Class Organizations of Workers (CEDOCUT).\n.According to the ICFTU, Caar Pauta disappeared on  November  in a district south of the city of Quito after having been arrested by eight unidentified men in two blue Toyota jeeps, identical to the vehicles used by the national army. These men, who referred to each other by their military grades, mistakenly connected him with the Group of Peoples\' Forces (GCP), according to the complaint lodged on  December  by the president of the CEDOCUT demanding that the authorities carry out an in-depth investigation to ascertain that Mr. Caar was alive and that there should be an end to the death squads\' actions against trade unionists and trade union officials.\n.The ICFTU adds that on  December the body of Mr. Caar was found at Latacunga ( km from Quito, on a bridge crossing the Yanayacu River); his body bore signs of torture and his hands were tied behind his back; some of his body had been burned and it appeared that he had been drowned. His death and the circumstances surrounding it are alarming indications of what a serious disintegration of political and social life might imply in Ecuador given that in addition to this crime, since the present administration took office, there have been disturbing signs of an authoritarian attitude towards social unrest and the legitimate demands of Ecuadorian social organizations to express their disagreement with the economic measures taken by the new Government.\n.The ICFTU points out that during the demonstrations, protest actions and the general strike held on  October , declared by the trade union movement at the national level, about  workers were arrested (and subsequently released); there were several wounded and three workers killed as a result of the brutal way in which the national police and army quelled the demonstrations; furthermore, the police and army also placed troops in the indigenous communities and in major cities throughout the country. Immediately after the strike in October, the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Organizations (CEOSL) complained that a campaign was being carried out to discredit and intimidate its president, Jos Chvez Chvez, who was threatened with legal action by the Minister of the Interior for declarations he made to the press on the eve of the national strike.\n.Furthermore, the CEOSL points out that according to the magazine ""Caretas"", published in Colombia, Carlos Castao, the famous leader of the Colombian paramilitary, boasted in an interview he made to this magazine that he had trained  persons of Ecuadorian nationality in combat practices with a view to launching an offensive against the labour activists.\n.In its communications dated , ,  March and  May , the Government states that given the importance it attached to the respect of human rights, it was grateful for the communication sent inasmuch as it had revealed the concern that Mr. Sal Caar Pauta\'s death had caused amongst various international organizations. In this respect, the Government states that it had immediately handed over an in-depth investigation of this case to the criminal investigation department -- headed by the Eighth Criminal Prosecutor of Pichincha -- and that the preliminary report of this investigation had, upon completion, been sent to the Second Magistrate of the Cotopaxi Criminal Court (the Government sent a copy of the report as an annex). For their part, civil groups set up a special committee called ""Peace and Life"", made up of representatives from human rights and workers\' organizations, the Peoples\' Attorney and civil groups, which conducted an investigation with their own sources (the Government encloses a preliminary report of this committee). Similarly, the Minister of the Interior took it upon herself to establish a dialogue with this committee so that as objective an analysis as possible might be made of the findings of the various sources looked into with a view to casting light on the truth.\n.The Government states that the most relevant conclusion of the committee set up by civil groups is that any possibility that the matter might have been a state crime has been definitely ruled out and that the State and Government were in no way responsible or involved; the Government feels that it is vital that those organizations concerned in this case should be informed of this matter. This murder has nothing whatsoever to do with the Ecuadorian State and the Government has decided to continue with inquiries in order to identify, locate and arrest those responsible for the crime, their accomplices and accessories after the fact and to punish the guilty parties. Similarly, the Government rejects the insinuations and assertions made by the complainant which cast a doubt on the legally established order in the State of Ecuador and considers them extremely irresponsible and totally unfounded; it points out that the false evidence given and the fanciful assumptions made by certain national trade union organizations lodging this complaint do not bear up in the slightest to the investigations officially carried out. According to the Government, trade union officers did not provide information during the investigation on the possible authors of the crime.\n.The Government states that it acts with total transparency because it believes in upholding respect for human rights in Ecuador in accordance with the international Conventions ratified by Ecuador and that it has sent the documents relating to the measures taken during the investigation.\n.In its communication of  April , the Government states that a national strike was held on  October  to protest against the economic adjustment measures it had taken, all of which led to acts of violence, vandalism, rampage and aggressions against persons who did not participate in the protests. Less than  persons were arrested in the whole country, not  as alleged by the complainant. Those arrested were individuals which incited the perpetration of acts of vandalism, destruction of vehicles, theft from individuals who were not taking part in the national strike, looting of all kinds of stores, and destruction of public and private property. Those detained, who were neither trade unionists nor workers, were released without any problem. All these measures of detention were taken with the sole purpose of avoiding a further aggravation of the protests.\n.The Government adds that Mr. Jorge Annibal Mena died in Trinitaria, a small town in the Province of Guyaquil. This is where social violence, caused by persons armed with all sorts of objects, erupted to a peak. All the residents of that sector, including those without any trade union link, participated spontaneously into the protests which culminated', 'fundamental objective should be the economic and social advancement of their members "".\n.On the other hand the Committee deplores the fact that, in spite of repeated requests\' for precise information concerning the detention of the other trade unionists mentioned in the complaint, the Government has once again restricted itself to stating in its communication of  February , referring to only two of the cases of arrest, that both the trade unionists concerned had infringed the provisions of the Penal Code, without throwing more light on the exact nature of the alleged offences with which these persons are charged, and that no judicial proceedings seem to have been taken against them.\n.Although these two trade unionists, Messrs. Checa and Aroca, have been released at some time after the date on which the complaint was lodged, in view of the importance it has always attached, in all cases where trade unionists are detained for political offences or common law crimes, to the principle that the persons concerned should be tried with all the safeguards of regular judicial procedure, at the earliest possible moment and by an impartial and independent judicial authority, the Committee, in accordance with the practice it has followed hitherto in similar cases, recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government\'s attention to the dangers that measures for the detention of trade unionists might entail for freedom of association if such measures are not accompanied by proper judicial safeguards, and to the fact that every government should make it a rule to ensure respect for human rights and, in particular, the right of every detained person to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority.""\n.With respect to the other three trade unionists, Messrs. Espinosa, Cajas and Reinoso, whose arrest has also been alleged by the complainants, the Government has not submitted any information up to the present.\n.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that the trade unionists Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara, Mesias Zamora Prez, Francisco Checa and Carlos Aroca have been released;(b) to draw the Government\'s attention, however, to:(i) the importance the Committee has always attached to the opinion of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the effect that trade unions should not be prohibited in general terms from engaging in any political activities, and that the judicial authorities should be entrusted with the task of repressing abuses which might be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be "" the economic and social advancement "" of their members;(ii) the dangers that measures for the detention of trade unionists might entail for freedom of association if such measures are not accompanied by proper judicial safeguards, and the fact that every government should make it a rule to ensure respect for human rights and, in particular, the right of every detained person to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority;(c) to request the Government once again to forward, as a matter of urgency, its precise observations concerning the alleged detention of Messrs. Hugo Espinosa, Luis Cajas and Teodoro Reinoso, indicating further the present situation of these persons before the law;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further when it has received the additional information from the Government, as indicated in subparagraph (c) above.\n.This case was examined by the Committee at its sessions in February and May  when it made interim reports. In the rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May ), the Committee made definitive recommendations on allegations relating to the intervention of the authorities in a conflict which had arisen on the Huayllamba estate. In the present report the Committee examines the remaining allegations, which relate to the detention of a number of trade union officers and to the infringement of trade union rights by the authorities in the province of Chimborazo.\n.The original complaint was submitted by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) on  November . It was then forwarded to the Government, which sent in its observations on  January . The complainants submitted another complaint in a letter dated  December , which was also forwarded to the Government.\n.Ecuador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with respect to the allegations regarding infringement of trade union rights in the province of Chimborazo, to take note of the statements made by the Government in its letter of  August and to decide, with the reservation expressed in paragraph  above, that there is no object in continuing to examine this aspect of the case;(b) with respect to the allegations regarding the arrest of the trade union leaders Francisco Checa, Carlos Aroca, Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara, Mesas Zamora Prez, Hugo Espinosa, Luis Cajas and Teodoro Reinoso, to take note of the statements made by the Government in the same letter and to ask the Government to send as soon as possible more complete information on this aspect of the case, including an account of the offences with which each of the trade unionists whose names are cited has been charged, and the result of the proceedings, and the text of any judgments given with their grounds;(c) to take note of this interim report on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the additional information for which the Government is to be asked.\n.This case was examined by the Committee at its session in February , when it made an interim report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).\n.Ecuador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In examining this case the Committee noted that the Latin-American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) had submitted its first complaint on  November . It was then forwarded to the Government, which sent in its observations on  January . The complainants had submitted another complaint in a letter dated  December , but the Government had not made any observations on it.\n.In its communication dated  November  C.L.A.S.C declared that the Ecuadorian Federation of Catholic Workers (C.E.D.O.C.) was being systematically subjected to discrimination and prosecution which constituted an infringement of freedom of association. In September  trade union leaders Francisco Checa and Carlos Aroca were incarcerated in Machachi on being apprehended attending a meeting of peasants convened to found a peasants\' league for that locality. At approximately the same time in Naranjito, trade unionists Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara and Mesias Zamora Prez were incarcerated for distributing leaflets to peasants with the aim of convening a meeting to found another peasants\' league. At a later date, in the province of Chimborazo, the civil and military chief of the area imprisoned a number of peasant leaders for forming a trade union on the Huayllamba estate and campaigning for their rights; he also threatened the C.E.D.O.C leaders in the province, sending a telegram to C.E.D.O.C reading as follows: "" Owner Huayllamba estate settled problems fairly. Demagogic party campaign you are conducting cannot be tolerated in any circumstances. Extremist agitators in your service will be treated as they deserve."" The complainants concluded their communication by declaring that the Ministry of Labour was pursuing a policy which was especially discriminatory against C.E.D.O.C and that in some areas the authorities prohibited trade union meetings and had also abolished the right to strike.\n.In its reply dated  January  the Government declared that C.E.D.O.C had never been subjected to any discrimination whatsoever, nor had its leaders been persecuted. The organisation concerned enjoyed the same safeguards for pursuing its trade union activity as other workers\' associations formed in compliance with the law and recognised by the Government. Furthermore, the Government rejected the allegation that a military chief used force to defend the estate owners. The Huayllamba estate case was finally settled by the intervention of an official sent by the Director-General of Labour, and an agreement between employer and agricultural workers was signed. Unfortunately the trade union backed by C.E.D.O.C, deviating from its specific objectives, engaged in incitement to violence and thus brought about the subsequent intervention of the police authorities after the labour aspect of the problem had been solved.\n.The Committee observed that the Government in its reply made no reference to the specific allegations contained in the complaint regarding the imprisonment of Messrs. Francisco Checa, Carlos Aroca, Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara and Mesias Zamora Prez.']"
