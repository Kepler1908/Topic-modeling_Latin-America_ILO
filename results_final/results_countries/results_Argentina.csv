0,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA Workers) dated  August .
.The Government sent observations by communications dated  May  and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organization alleges that the government of Tierra del Fuego Province arrogated to itself the authority to annul a collective agreement in force that was applicable to the public employees of the province, by simply revoking the administrative decision that had approved the collective agreement. In this connection, the CTA Workers requests the Committee to urge the Government to overturn the administrative revocation immediately and to resume dialogue with the trade union organizations representing public employees.
.The complainant indicates that: (i) the collective agreement for the staff of the provincial public administration was concluded on  November , then approved by Decision No. / of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MTEySS) and published in the Official Bulletin of Tierra del Fuego Province on  December ; (ii) the signatories of the collective agreement were the Association of State Workers, the National Civil Servants?Union and the Association of Health Workers of Argentina; (iii) the collective agreement in question had been concluded after a laborious process fraught with difficulties, which had lasted more than  years (from the opening of the bargaining on the basis of the approval of Provincial Law No.  until the conclusion, registration, approval and publication of the final text); (iv)the collective agreement was approved by the provincial administrative authorities and its provisions came into effect immediately ?with the exception of any that involved changes to budget lines ?hence the text of the collective agreement indicated that, in accordance with Provincial Law No. , it would become applicable only after approval by the provincial legislature; (v) after new government authorities took office as a result of the democratic electoral process, the Provincial Attorney General issued an opinion pointing to the existence of inconsistencies that must be reviewed, but did not indicate any specific measures to be adopted; (vi) following this opinion, Provincial Decree / was issued, instructing the Ministry of Labour to issue an administrative decision revoking Decision MTEySS No. / on the grounds of illegitimacy? whereupon the Provincial Ministry of Labour issued Decision MTyE No. / revoking Decision MTEySS No. / (which had approved the collective agreement) on the grounds that it is contrary to the provincial public order and is a matter of administrative law? (vii) the administrative decisions that resulted in the revocation were issued without the parties having had any opportunity to submit their arguments, thereby wholly contravening the guarantees provided by the right to effective administrative and judicial oversight; (viii) as a result of the revocation of the approval of the collective agreement, the local authorities understood that they must return to the provisions applicable before the collective agreement entered into force (in other words, based on the interpretative approach, Decree Law ., which emanated from the last dictatorship that was de facto in power in Argentina, came back into effect); (ix) legal proceedings were lodged before the competent labour court but were rejected on formal grounds (specifically, the court held that the application for amparo [protection of constitutional rights] was not the appropriate route to handle the claims, and found that arbitrariness and unlawfulness had not been demonstrated and that, as approval is a general administrative decision? it is by definition essentially revocable?by the provincial executive power); and (x) this meant that the public servants of the province were wholly deprived of the collective agreements and their rights derived from them.
.In its communication of  May , the Government transmits the observations of the authorities of the province concerned, which indicate that: (i) the issues that gave substance to the revocation of the approval decision were established after an exhaustive examination of the respective actions and procedures, in particular the considerations of the Attorney General of Tierra del Fuego Province, which the legal services of the ministerial bodies did not consider to be open to criticism; (ii) they also note that none of the trade unions who were signatories to the collective agreement took action to challenge or appeal against the administrative decision in question; (iii) a collective agreement is currently being negotiated with the same trade union organizations that were involved in the impugned agreement whose approval was revoked; (iv) in the context of legal proceedings related to the issues raised by the complainant, the judicial authority held that approval is a general administrative decision and, by definition, is essentially revocable by the executive power of the province; and (v) with the exception of the observations that led to the decision on the revocation of approval, the provincial Ministry of Labour has never registered any complaints from any trade union concerning past or present actions that limit or restrict the validity of the rights to freedom of association or the continuation of bargaining with a view to concluding a collective agreement for the staff of the provincial public administration.
.By a communication of  May , the Government submits the dossier concerning the collective bargaining process and informs the Committee of the signing of a new collective agreement which, according to the parties concerned, amply resolved the conflict. As a result, the Government requests that the case be closed.
.The present complaint reports that a collective agreement that was in force was annulled by a provincial government through the revocation of the administrative decision approving the agreement. The Committee observes that the provincial authorities indicate that the issues which gave substance to the revocation of the decision approving the agreement followed an exhaustive examination of the actions and that the judicial authority affirmed that approval is a revocable administrative decision.
.The Committee observes that the reasons stated in the respective decisions to revoke the approval include matters such as a lack of the requisite consideration of budgetary implications, irregularities in the administrative proceedings or in equal representation, and contradictions of the legal or public order in labour matters. In this connection, the Committee notes that the text of Provincial Decree /, which was enclosed with the complaint, indicates that the Attorney General held that the collective agreement did not undergo an in-depth legal analysis concerning the rules of the provincial public order that must be respected ?nor was an exhaustive examination undertaken of the provisions that directly entailed budgetary commitments or changes"", having observed ""irregularities in the administrative procedures followed by the competent ministerial portfolio, resulting from the existence of three separate dossiers, and non-observance of the established bargaining system or the points/agenda items established by the Ministry; nor was the participation of duly appointed equal representatives observed ?which leads to the conclusion that the procedure followed in the bargaining did not contribute to making it transparent and legitimate"". Furthermore, the Committee observes that Provincial Decree / held that ""the collective agreement has clear flaws which disrupt the public order in labour matters ?such as the Argentinian nationality entry requirement for the public administration"" or contradict provincial legislation and alludes to the existence of provisions of the collective agreement that have budgetary implications that were not analysed in advance and included by the government authorities. In this connection, the Committee considers that the lengthy negotiation process (of more than  years) should have allowed all the necessary verifications to be carried out ex ante and that the unilateral revocation of the legal effects of the collective agreement after its entry into force, as in the case of the present complaint, does not help in the promotion of collective bargaining.
.Furthermore, the Committee duly notes that, according to information provided by the Government in its communication of  May , the subsequent negotiations concluded with the signing of a collective agreement that amply settled the conflict, according to the parties involved. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination and is closed.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,2020,Argentina
1,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the Single Union of stallholders of outlets centres, street markets and shopping precincts of the Republic of Argentina (SUPOFEPRA) of December . SUPOFEPRA sent additional information through communications dated October ,  March and  July ,  August  and  July .
.The Government sent its observations in communications received on  August  and February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  December , the complainant indicates that: (i) on  August , having met all the requirements under the Act on trade union associations (LAS) No. ., SUPOFEPRA applied to the Directorate of Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security for registration as a trade union; (ii) on  February , it received notification by the Ministry requesting it to amend certain administrative errors of form and pointing out that there had to be a relationship of dependence between the members and the employers that lease or rent out the stalls to them; and (iii) on  February  it responded to this request, stating that article  bis of the National Constitution grants the right to establish a trade union to all workers and not only to those in a relationship of dependence, and requested the Ministry to take into account the jurisprudence established by the State concerning the recognition and registration of other trade unions that organize workers without a relationship of dependence, such as the Union of Taxi Drivers of the Federal Capital with trade union status No. , the National Federation of Taxi Drivers with trade union status No. , the Single Union of Haulage Companies with trade union status No., the Union of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors with trade union status No. , the Union of Street, Beach and Coastal Vendors of the Mar del Plata Area with trade union registration No. , the Union of Sports Stadium and Train Station Vendors with trade union registration No.  and the Street Vendors Union with trade union status No. .
.In its communications of  October ,  March and  July ,  August  and July , the complainant indicates that by resolution / dated  July , the State granted trade union registration to the Single Union of Street Market Workers of the Republic of Argentina (SUTFRA) (formerly known as SUPOFEPRA), thereby becoming the first trade union organization to organize street market and stallholder workers?activity. The complainant indicates that, according to the text of the resolution in question, only workers in a relationship of dependence in the street market, marketplace and shopping precinct sector were allowed to organize. The complainant considers that this is not logical since the issue relates precisely to activities of the informal economy and it cannot be said that in such informality there are workers in a relationship of dependence. The complainant organization, which claims to represent independent workers ?workers in fairs, markets, and shopping precincts ?within the informal economy, indicates that according to the master file on the basis of which it was granted trade union registration, it was demonstrated that the sector is economically subordinated. The complainant also indicates that on  August  it requested the Ministry, through case No.EX---APN-DGDMT, to allow non-waged independent workers to organize and that on  January  it requested the Ministry, through case No. EX---APN-DGDMT, to issue a resolution in this regard.
.The complainant indicates that on  January , it also requested the Ministry to grant it trade union status (the complainant attached a copy of the request, which bears a receipt stamp of the Ministry) and alleges that the Ministry has been delaying without logical or legal grounds, in a clearly arbitrary manner, the granting of union status, despite the fact that it is urgently needed by the sector. The complainant indicates that on  April  it informed the Ministry of the signing of a collective labour agreement with an employer in the sector and requested its respective approval to confer an erga omnes nature on the agreement. The complainant alleges that the Ministry rejected the application for the approval of the collective labour agreement submitted, arguing that the union did not have trade union status. The complainant attached a copy of a technical report of the Technical Legal Advisory Unit of the Ministry dated  June , which indicates that SUTFRA holds only simple trade union registration, and therefore does not have sufficient capacity to negotiate the collective agreement. The report indicates that, in accordance with the Act on collective bargaining No. and the LAS, it is the organization with trade union status that has bargaining capacity. The complainant indicates that the Ministry does not consider that SUTFRA is a pioneer trade union organization that organizes workers in fairs, markets, and shopping precincts, and that there is no such other organization holding either a trade union status or simple registration.
.In its communications received on  August  and  February , the Government indicates that the complainant does not identify in the complaint how the exercise of its freedom of association has been restricted. The Government indicates that the complainant has sent several communications and that in each of them it has used different terms ranging from the relationship of dependence, independent work, informality, micro-entrepreneurship, economic subordination, and interdependent work, choosing and highlighting what suits it best, and making assertions without any basis and without providing any documentation to support such assertions, which makes it impossible to determine the number of members it claims to have. The Government also understands that this difficulty in understanding who are the workers that it claims to represent entails the risk of endorsing the concealment of real employment relationships that accompany processes of non-compliance with labour law.
.The Government states that: (i) in its first communication, the complainant refers to the written submission it made before the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Security, in which it stated that the trade union was made up of mostly self-employed workers with interdependence?or economically dependent self-employed work? due to the large number of informal workers or what is currently called para-subordinate workers?who, although there is economic dependence on those who benefit from their services, are not registered as workers in a relationship of dependence; (ii) in its second communication the complainant maintains that on  July , the former Ministry of Production and Labour, now the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, issued resolution / which granted trade union registration to the Single Union of Street Market Workers of the Republic of Argentina (SUTFRA), as a first-degree trade association to organize workers employed in fairs, shopping precincts and municipal markets, with an area of action in different cities of the country; (iii) subsequently, the complainant indicates having demonstrated a marked economic subordination in which its comrades are immersed and points out that the State must provide them with the solution that will bring them dignity and recognition as independent workers; (iv) in another communication, the complainant indicates that in the master file through which they were granted trade union registration, it was demonstrated that the sector is economically subordinated; and (v) in the context of its inaccuracies, the complainant states that it also brings together independent workers.
.The Government indicates that it would appear from the foregoing that the complainant claims to represent all workers in the country, citing a series of statistics in which the source of the information is not substantiated and that the lack of precision from the complainant makes it impossible to establish what its personal scope of representation is.
.The Government indicates that, although the complainant claims to have signed a collective bargaining agreement with employers in the sector and that the Ministry of Labour would have rejected its request for approval on the grounds that it does not have trade union status, the Government has no information other than this claim, nor a reference to the records of the workers it claims to represent. The Government indicates that SUTFRA was granted registration due to the mere registration of  members in a relationship of dependence and that, in order to have the power to negotiate collective bargaining agreements, it will have to compare with the organizations in the sector that claim to be the most representative based on objective criteria. The Government indicates that some trade unions have applied to the Ministry of Labour to reserve the rights of each trade union for the opportunity provided for in article  of the LAS (application for trade union status), requesting that the comparative representativeness assessment be carried out with SUTFRA. The LAS differentiates between trade union organizations that are simply registered and those that hold trade union status, meaning those recognized by the State",0,2018,Argentina
2,"as the most representative in their territorial scope. Pursuant to the provisions of article (c) of the LAS, trade union organizations with the trade union status are those that have the exclusive right to intervene in collective bargaining. The Government indicates that, according to the records kept by the Ministry, there is no administrative action showing that SUTFRA has submitted itself to the objective comparative assessment to represent workers in collective bargaining. The Government also indicates that, according to the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour, although SUTFRA has a mandate for the period from October  to October , the trade union is going through a serious institutional conflict within its executive committee, which is currently in leaderless.
.The Government states that it has been focusing its efforts on promoting workers?rights as a key element in achieving inclusive and sustainable growth, with particular attention to freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining as enabling rights, thereby also promoting the transition from the informal to the formal economy. The Government notes that informality is a broad concept and that the informal economy includes wage and self-employed workers, family workers, and workers who move from one status to the other; it includes workers who are engaged in new flexible work arrangements and who are on the periphery of the core business or at the end of the production chain? The Government indicates that in May  it created the Commission for Disputes, Mediation and Proposals of the Basic Subsistence Economy with the aim of preserving social peace and guaranteeing the right of every person to have the opportunity to earn a living by means that ensure them decent living conditions, and indicates that, among other powers, this Commission prepares reports and proposals that tend to the transition from informality to formality and transparency.
.The Government also refers to Resolution No. / of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which establishes that persons working in the popular and basic subsistence economy may join associations and exercise the rights granted to them by the resolution, once the relevant registration has been obtained. The Government indicates that workers in the popular and basic subsistence economy are considered to be, among others, those who work individually or collectively to generate personal and family income, whether they are self-employed, casual, or occasional workers; street vendors; occupants of street stalls, small fairs, and handcraft sales; vehicle attendants; shoeshiners; or work for cooperatives.
.The Government indicates that the Registry of Associations of Workers?Associations of the Popular Economy and Basic Subsistence has been created within the Ministry of Labour and that the resolution admitting the registration will grant social status so that the association can exercise different rights such as representing its members, individually or collectively, and promoting their participation in all activities that help the transition from informality to formality. The Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour will oversee the administration of the Registry and that the Procedural Regulations of the Registry were approved in .
.The Committee notes that in the complaint submitted in , the complainant, which claims to represent informal economy workers, specifically stallholders in outlet centres, street markets and shopping precincts, alleges that the process initiated a year previously to obtain its trade union registration had not been completed and that it had been notified that there had to be a relationship of dependence between the members and the employers that lease or rent out the stalls to them. The Committee notes that, in subsequent communications, the complainant contests the ministerial resolution of  which, while it granted trade union registration, allowed SUTFRA to organize only workers who provide services in a relationship of dependence, which it considers illogical as it represents workers in the informal economy. The Committee notes that the complainant indicates that, although it has asked the Ministry to allow it to organize workers without a relationship of dependence, it has reportedly not received a reply in this regard. The Committee also takes note that the complainant additionally alleges that, despite being a pioneer trade union organization that brings together workers in fairs, markets, and shopping precincts, the Ministry has been delaying without any grounds the granting of union status (requested in ), and that, given that it does not have union status, its application for the approval of a collective labour agreement was rejected.
.The Committee notes that, the Government, for its part, points out that: (i) the complainant does not indicate in what way the exercise of its freedom of association has been limited and in the various communications sent it uses terms ranging from relationship of dependence, independent work, informality, micro-entrepreneurship, economic subordination, interdependent work, making unfounded assertions and without accompanying any documentation, with which it is impossible to establish the personal scope of representation of SUTFRA and to determine its number of members; (ii) on  July , pursuant to Resolution /, SUTFRA was granted registration due to the mere registration of ? members with a relationship of dependence? (iii) in order to negotiate collective bargaining agreements, SUTFRA must be comparatively assessed with the most representative organizations in the sector based on objective criteria and in this case some unions have already presented themselves to the Ministry and have requested a comparative representativeness assessment with SUTFRA in order to obtain trade union status and there is no record that SUTFRA has presented itself for the assessment; and (iv) SUTFRA is going through a serious institutional conflict within its executive committee, which is currently leaderless. The Committee also notes the Governments indications that it has been taking a series of measures to promote and encourage the transition from informality to formality and to guarantee the rights of informal workers. The Government refers, among other measures, to the establishment of the Commission on Conflicts, Mediation and Uprisings in the Basic Subsistence Economy and the Register of Associations of Workers?Associations in the Popular and Basic Subsistence Economy.
.The Committee observes that the complainant and the Government concur that, by virtue of the ministerial resolution /, SUTFRA was registered as a trade union to organize workers in a dependent relationship who provide services in street markets, shopping precincts and municipal markets. The Committee notes, however, that the complainant objects to the fact that it was told there must be a relationship of dependence between the members and the employers renting the stalls and that, although it requested to be allowed to organize workers without a relationship of dependence, it did not receive a reply in this respect. While noting that the Government highlights that the trade union has not provided documentation to establish its personal scope of representation, the Committee observes that the Government has not pronounced itself on the elements that would prevent SUTFRA from being granted the right to affiliate both dependent and independent workers in the sector concerned.
.The Committee recalls that it requested a government to take the necessary measures to ensure that self-employed workers fully enjoyed freedom of association rights, in particular the right to join organizations of their own choosing and that the free exercise of the right to establish and join unions implies the free determination of the structure and composition of unions, [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ]. Further recalling that the criterion for determining the persons covered by the right to organize is not based on the existence of an employment relationship and that workers who do not have employment contracts should have the right to form the organizations of their choosing if they so wish [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee expects the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that workers in outlets, fairs and shopping precincts, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing, subject only to the rules of the organizations concerned. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the trade union status that SUTFRA allegedly requested in , the Committee observes that, from the documentation submitted by the Government, it appears that other trade union organizations appeared before the Ministry and requested that a comparative assessment be made in order to determine which of them is the most representative in their territorial area. The Committee observes that, while the complainant alleges that there is an unjustified delay in the processing of the application for trade union status, according to the Government, SUTFRA did not submit itself to such an assessment and, consequently, since it does not have trade union status, the approval of the collective agreement would have been denied. Noting that the above seems to indicate a lack of communication between SUTFRA and the competent ministerial authorities, the Committee requests the Government to engage in constructive dialogue with all the parties concerned to resolve the issues concerning freedom of association in the informal economy and to resolve the issues concerning representativeness of SUTFRA",4,2018,Argentina
3,"as soon as possible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expects the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that workers, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing, subject only to the rules of the organizations concerned. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee requests the Government to engage in constructive dialogue with all the parties concerned to resolve the issues concerning freedom of association in the informal sector and to resolve the issues concerning representativeness of SUTFRA as soon as possible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",-1,2018,Argentina
4,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Latin American and Caribbean Confederation of Public Employees (CLATE), the Association of Professional Workers of the National Atomic Energy Commission and the Nuclear Sector (APCNEAN) and the Association of State Workers (ATE), which was received on  January .
.The Government sent observations by a communication of  March .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organizations allege that, in the first process of sectoral collective bargaining provided for under the applicable legislation, the national Government constantly delayed and impeded bargaining.
.In particular, they allege that, with respect to collective bargaining in the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA): (i) in the context of a pay claim in accordance with the provisions of Act No. ., the CNEA as the employer requested at a meeting on October  the opening of a collective bargaining process for the workers of the enterprise; (ii) the CNEA relied on the  Nuclear Act, which established that the relationship with its workers is governed by the Employment Contract Act; (iii) subsequently, on  May , the APCNEAN called for the bargaining to be opened, as did other organizations active in the CNEA (the ATE, the National Civil Servants?Union (UPCN) and the Association of Technicians of the CNEA (ATCNEA)) on various occasions; (iv) on  June , negotiations were opened and at a subsequent meeting separate technical committees were established to address the various items to be included in the collective agreement to be signed; (v) throughout the endless bargaining, the trade unions sought to discuss pay increases (which were invariably set by the State with the participation of only the UPCN); (vi) the employers representation ?consisting of peers designated by the CNEA and other State actors ?abruptly and without explanation stopped participating in the technical meetings and stopped providing information; (vii) requests and petitions were made to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security to urge the employers representatives to return to the negotiating table, but the Ministry disregarded all the requests, in complicity with the employer; (viii) on  January , the board of the CNEA stated that it could not continue to attend the meetings owing to a lack of instructions from the Government; (ix) in view of the prolonged delay, the ATE filed an application for the protection of constitutional rights (amparo) before the courts, which issued a ruling on September  that was subsequently upheld by the Appeals Chamber; (x)however, the Ministry of Labour delayed the implementation of the court decision, and bargaining only resumed on December ; (xi) in the long gap, there was a change in Government administration, the nuclear plan?involving the construction of two new nuclear power stations was put on hold and a new State actor, the Secretariat for Modernization, emerged, whose role was to impede the bargaining process further still; and (xii) consequently, in practical terms the process remains at the initial phase, as the last meeting of the bargaining committee was held on  September  and the following meeting was scheduled for  November .
.Furthermore, the complainants also report delays in and impediments to collective bargaining in the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (ARN), alleging in this respect that: (i) on June , the APCNEAN called for the opening of the relevant sectoral collective bargaining; (ii) the ARN (and subsequently the ATE and the UPCN) expressed their support; (iii) however, the request was not accepted and on  March  the APCNEAN requested that the parties be urged to comply; (iv) finally, on  November , the meeting was held, following the amparo application filed by the APCNEAN before the courts which resulted in an order to comply; and (v) the meetings subsequently took place without any tangible results, always facing different types of delays on the part of the employer, with the complicity of the Ministry.
.The complainants consider that the States dilatory approach in the aforementioned bargaining violates freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining and caused irreparable harm in terms of pay and working and living conditions. They consider that there is no will to bargain and that the opportunity to bargain freely is not guaranteed.
.Firstly, the complainants state that the actions they report concern the cancellation of sectoral collective bargaining and the impossibility of negotiating pay and working conditions. In this respect, they recall that: (i) in accordance with Act No. . governing the procedure for collective bargaining in the national public service, the parties may negotiate a framework and/or general collective agreement and, at a lower level, sectoral collective agreements by bodies or sectors, always within the framework of the general collective agreement; (ii) the national public service of the Argentine Republic has an approved general collective agreement and various sectoral collective agreements, some of which have been approved and are in force, and others that are in the process of negotiation; (iii)in the aforementioned cases of the CNEA and the ARN, the delays mean that the bargaining proceedings?have already taken (as of the date of presentation of the complaint)  and  years, respectively, which is evidence of a political decision to decline to negotiate the working conditions of this group of workers with the trade union organizations; (iv) in the context of the collective bargaining in force, because there are not yet any sectoral collective agreements in the CNEA and the ARN, the pay increases that are applied are those that are agreed at the general level, in which only the ATE and the UPCN participate in the bargaining; and (v) as the latter is the majority trade union, it negotiates only the pay scale ?which is always far removed from the needs of the workers ?such that collective bargaining in the sectors is impeded through the general bargaining committee, which lacks genuine debate.
.Secondly, the complainant organizations consider that the actions described constitute a breach of the duty to negotiate in good faith. They state that, after more than ten years of bargaining? all parameters of good faith in the matters have been put aside by the national public service as the State employer, in that it indirectly declined to conclude the sectoral collective agreements.
.Thirdly, the complainants allege that, instead of acting as an impartial or independent body, the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was complicit in supporting the irregular actions of the public employers. They state that, after more than ten years without results, the Ministry adjusted its approach at the request of the national Government to prevent sectoral collective agreements from being concluded in the two bodies, which is evidenced by the fact that it never called on the public employer to negotiate in good faith, arranged meetings at an appropriate time or requested joint members with decision-making powers to attend negotiations, among other measures that might have advanced the negotiations.
.In its communication of  March , the Government transmits its observations on the case and provides information, firstly, on the handling of the proceedings concerning the collective bargaining processes that are the subject of the complaint. The Government states that: (i)there was no conduct on the part of the authorities that impeded or obstructed collective bargaining in the relevant sectors and that the parties engaged in bargaining over time, but did not reach an agreement that would enable a collective agreement to be signed; and (ii) nor was there any obstructive conduct concerning pay, as the subjects for collective bargaining were validated in accordance with the legislation in force, which, through the negotiations within the bargaining committee for the general collective agreement, periodically defined the pay increases applicable to workers in the national public service.
.Concerning collective bargaining in the CNEA, the Government indicates that: (i)the parties were invited to the preparatory meeting on the establishment of the joint sectoral committee of the CNEA, when they agreed to establish three working committees and agreed on the timetable of meetings, and the Ministry of Labour requested the parties to keep the implementing authority informed of the progress of negotiations in the three committees so that a further meeting could be organized when necessary; (ii) in  and  the committee met for the purposes of implementing the pay increases agreed under the general collective agreement; (iii) in , the ATCNEA requested that the committee meet to discuss a sectoral collective agreement; (iv) the Undersecretariat for Budgetary Affairs replied that the ATCNEAs request would be examined when the representatives of the State employer meet, in accordance with article  of Act No. ., to determine the timetable for opening collective bargaining at the general and sectoral levels? (v) in this connection, the CNEA stated that it did not decline to participate in the technical subcommittees as the trade union representation claims, and that it considered the continued",0,2019,Argentina

.Concerning collective bargaining in the ARN, the Government indicates that: (i) on the basis of the request from the APCNEAN, steps were taken to begin discussing a sectoral collective agreement and the request was first sent to the ARN so that it could take a position; (ii) the ARN replied that it was agreed to the opening of the joint body to discuss a new collective agreement; (iii)the request was subsequently communicated to the remainder of the State employer and the UPCN and ATE trade unions to allow them to intervene; (iv) the Secretariat of Public Affairs replied, indicating that the request had to be transmitted in accordance with the provisions of General Collective Agreement No./ and Act No..; (v) on October , the ARN stated that the competent body to settle the matter was the National Office of Public Employment; (vi) subsequently the APCNEAN filed amparo proceedings on the grounds of delays; (vii) on  September , invitations were issued for a preparatory meeting on the opening of the sectoral bargaining committee of the staff of the ARN, scheduled for  September ; (viii) the ATE did not attend the meeting, and the parties were informed of the application made by the APCNEAN and new meetings were scheduled; (ix)on November , the chairperson of the public sector bargaining committee issued an administrative ruling that was notified to the parties, requesting the representatives of the trade unions to unify their position and propose a list of subjects to be handled by the sectoral bargaining committee, to be transmitted to the public employer, and informing them that until the required documentation had been submitted and transmission had been confirmed, the deadline under article  of Act No. . would be suspended; (x) the parties remained silent and the notification was reissued; (xi) subsequently the parties were sent an invitation to a further meeting to formally establish the sectoral bargaining committee for the staff of the ARN, in which they were informed that they would have to agree at that meeting on the subjects to be handled by the committee and appoint up to three titular members and two substitute members plus the relevant advisers to the joint committee; (xii) the trade union representation as a whole announced the required topics and on  October  Regulation DALSP  was issued, which formally established the sectoral bargaining committee for the staff of the ARN; (xiii) once the members of the committee had been appointed, on  October  the parties were invited to an initial meeting, which at the request of the parties was moved to  October ; (xiv) at that meeting, the parties made proposals for the methodology to move the collective bargaining forward, agreeing to establish three technical committees and setting dates for additional meetings (four meetings to be held in November and December ); (xv) once those meetings had taken place, the parties made proposals, supplemented reports and debated the relevant topics, indicating the aspects on which they agreed or disagreed; (xvi) in the months that followed, the parties did not maintain meetings within the implementing authority, and  meetings were held between August  and August , at which the parties continued the bargaining; (xvii) the implementing authority urged the parties to maintain the ongoing dialogue and bargaining in good faith to seek a final agreement; (xviii) none of the parties appeared at the meeting scheduled on September , which was rescheduled for December ; (xix) between February and December , one to two meetings were held each month to continue the bargaining. At each meeting, the public employer made proposals (which the Government encloses with its reply to the complaint) and presented a text amended in accordance with the proposed sectoral collective agreement; (xx) the ATE and the APCNEAN submitted their respective proposals on the text presented by the public employer, which then presented a document with adjustments and additions to the completed text, on the basis of the comments and observations made by some of the trade unions. The public employer also incorporated a proposal with aspects related to the training and development programme?and operational modalities? which it presented for the consideration of the trade union entities; (xxi)subsequently, the implementing authority notified the parties by an April  ruling that, as a result of the inauguration of the new national government administration and of a restructuring of the national public service (by Decree No.  of  December ), the parties needed to approve or amend their nominations for the members of the sectoral bargaining committee for the staff of the ARN. Once the parties had met the requirements, the implementing authority declared the bargaining committee to have been established, by administrative ruling No. DI---E-APNDALSP#MT; (xxii)subsequently, the bargaining between the parties continued uninterrupted, and  meetings were held within the Ministry of Labour. Furthermore, the parties held private meetings within the aforementioned technical committees, which were held at the headquarters of the ARN; (xxiii) according to information provided by the parties, at those meetings they made proposals, supplemented reports and debated the relevant topics; (xxiv) at the time of the Governments reply, the parties had not reached full agreement on a final text of a collective agreement; (xxv)nevertheless, the bargaining committee continued its activity with the aim of concluding a sectoral collective agreement for its staff; and (xxvi) at the last meeting that took place at the Ministry of Labour, the parties agreed to meet on  August  in two technical committees at the headquarters of the ARN, and a further meeting at the Ministry of Labour was scheduled for",-1,2019,Argentina
6,"September , at which the parties did not appear.
.Moreover, the Government provides the following information on the particulars of pay bargaining in the national public service: (i)as of  the signatories of the general collective agreement for the public service, exercising their collective autonomy, decided to modify the pay bargaining modality for the public sector by unifying pay negotiations for the public sector within the scope of the bargaining committee for the general collective agreement; (ii) as from that agreement, the parties focused all pay bargaining in the general joint committee, where they resolved the setting of pay increases applicable to both workers covered by the general collective agreement and workers covered by sectoral collective agreements; (iii) consequently, on each occasion that the parties reached a pay agreement, they signed separate annexes with the pay scales governing each sector, meaning that the pay scale applicable to the workers in the various sectors of the national public service is defined through the collective bargaining within the general bargaining committee (rather than through sectoral bargaining committees); (iv)under the applicable legislation (Act No. . and the corresponding Regulatory Decree No./), the parties may use a sectoral collective agreement to negotiate matters not handled at the general level, matters expressly referred from the general level, and matters already handled at the general level to be adapted to the organization of work in the sector. In this respect, a sectoral collective agreement takes precedence over any other whenever it is more favourable overall to the workers.
.The present complaint alleges the constant obstruction of and delays in sectoral collective bargaining in two entities that are part of the national public service. The complainants consider that the actions they report are tantamount to the cancellation of sectoral collective bargaining, a lack of any possibility to negotiate working conditions and pay, a violation of the duty to negotiate in good faith and a lack of impartiality, and the Ministry of Labours complicity with the public employer in the bargaining process. The Government responds that: (i) there was no conduct on the part of the authorities that impeded or obstructed collective bargaining in the relevant sectors, and that the parties developed negotiations over time, without reaching an agreement that would enable a collective agreement to be signed; and (ii) nor was there any obstruction in matters of pay, as the subjects for collective bargaining were validated in accordance with the legislation in force, which, through the negotiations that developed as part of the bargaining committee for the general collective agreement, has periodically defined the pay increases applicable to the workers of the national public service.
.While observing from the Governments factual account that, during the phases subsequent to the proceedings that are the subject of the complaint, the negotiations proceeded with greater agility, the Committee is compelled to note the lengthiness of these sectoral collective bargaining proceedings ( and  years, as at the date of the Governments reply). The Committee also observes that, although the Government alludes in its reply to certain actions by the parties that might explain in part some of the delays in the proceedings (such as non-compliance with certain requirements), it does not provide explanations for significant allegations of delays made by the complainants (such as the delay that led the APCNEAN to file a judicial application for amparo on the grounds of delays, which culminated in an order to continue with the negotiations after years of paralysis).
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that it is important that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement; moreover genuine and constructive negotiations are a necessary component to establish and maintain a relationship of confidence between the parties. The principle that both employers and trade unions should negotiate in good faith and make efforts to reach an agreement means that any unjustified delay in the holding of negotiations should be avoided [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paragraphs  and ].
.The Committee hopes that, in light of the conclusions above, new measures will be taken where appropriate to pursue the promotion of collective bargaining in the two public entities concerned in the complaint.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expects that the necessary additional measures will be taken to continue promoting collective bargaining in the two public entities that are the subject of the complaint.(b) The Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination and is closed.",-1,2019,Argentina
7,".The complaint is contained in communications from the Confederation of Workers of Argentina, the Independent Confederation of Workers of Argentina and the Association of State Workers (ATE) dated  July  and  January .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No.), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications, the complainant organizations allege that the ATE has been excluded from the collective bargaining process for public employees of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, and in particular from the central joint negotiating committee.
.In their communication of  June , the complainants state that the ATE has the trade union status and representative capacity to bargain collectively in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and has engaged in collective bargaining in the past with the authorities in this context. The complainants refer in particular to a collective agreement reached between the ATE and the Government of the City of Buenos Aires (GCBA) in , after the courts had mandated the recognition of the ATE in  (in a ruling acknowledging the ATEs right to be involved in the city's general collective bargaining processes and ordering its inclusion in the central joint negotiating committee). The complainants point out in this regard that, in the public sector in general, and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires in particular, as established under Act No.  on industrial relations in the public administration of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, there are multiple trade unions that have trade union status. In respect of the central joint negotiating committee for public employees in the executive branch of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the complainants state that the unions with trade union status in the context of the general job classification structure are the ATE, the National Civil Servants?Union (UPCN) and the Union of State Workers of the City of Buenos Aires (SUTECBA). The complainants provide additional information to illustrate how the system of trade union pluralism works in other public sectors, for example pointing out how, in the education and health sectors, several unions participate at a single negotiating table.
.The complainants allege that the GCBA has nevertheless been excluding the ATE from collective bargaining in the context of the general job classification structure, by including only SUTECBA in the central joint negotiating committee. In this regard, the complainants state, to support this allegation, that: (i) in response to the ATEs request of  February  calling on the authorities to convene the central joint negotiating committee, the GCBA did not go ahead and convene the parties, but instead, on  March , belatedly announced that the various associations with trade union status would be called on to participate in the forthcoming bargaining process? The complainants consider this response to be a stalling tactic that circumvents the right to collective bargaining; and (ii) in the light of this response from the authorities, the ATE, by a communication of  March , one last time called on the GCBA to convene the central joint negotiating committee within  hours with all the competent organizations and to refrain from bargaining without the participation of the ATE, failing which it would consider stepping up the corresponding trade union and legal action. Consequently, the complainants conclude their initial communication by calling for the convening of the GCBA's central joint negotiating committee. They consider that the delays by the authorities in setting up the committee are inconsistent with the recognition that is given in other sectors ?such as the education or health sectors ?to joint bargaining with different organizations with trade union status. They refer to the recognition that is given to this model of trade union pluralism in the bargaining process in other legal systems, at both the national and the provincial levels, and claim furthermore that such pluralism is customary in the sector. The complainants also consider that the implementing authority is both judge and party to the dispute and they claim that, further to the request that was made, the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour, Industry and Trade did not convene the joint meeting, as the implementing authority for collective disputes and bargaining, thereby neglecting one of its duties and responsibilities and becoming complicit in the administration's bad faith in respect of bargaining.
.In their communication of  January , the complainants add to their allegations by stating that: (i) the Government of the Argentine Republic and the GCBA, which share the same political affiliations, are not respecting the principles of freedom of association, by developing a systematic plan against the ATE aimed at undermining its representative status ?a systematic plan that has various manifestations: the dismissal of trade union delegates, the seizure of union premises, challenges to union elections and exclusion from bargaining; (ii) throughout , the authorities engaged in bargaining processes from which the ATE was systematically excluded and they refused to provide the information requested by the ATE (they did not answer the letters from the ATE requesting that it be sent the minutes of the joint negotiations and informed of the arrangements for the convening of the negotiating committee); (iii) the exclusion has not been limited to collective bargaining on the general job classification structure but has extended to the negotiating committee for health professionals of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; and (iv) on  September , by resolution No. /MEFGC/, Joint Agreement No. / on wage increases for workers of the GCBA was put into effect exclusively with SUTECBA. The complainants call for the convening of the central joint negotiating committee of the GCBA and the central joint negotiating committee for health professionals of the GCBA with all competent parties, including the ATE.
.In its communication of May , the Government denies the allegations made and submits the GCBAs observations in this regard.
.The authorities first recall the position of trade union law in the framework of public administration, pointing out: (i) that in the public administration there may be several trade union associations with overlapping trade union status, in other words trade unions that cover some or all of the same categories of persons and geographical areas in the context of collective bargaining ?this is a situation that is codified in various laws, including National Act No.  and Act No. ; (ii) more than  trade union associations are operating in the area covered by the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, and more than  of them have trade union status to represent, depending on the case, all or some of the workers of the GCBA; and (iii) there are three associations that have been granted trade union status to represent all the workers of the GCBA. These are: SUTECBA, with a membership comprising approximately  per cent of the workers in the general job classification structure; the ATE, with a membership of approximately .per cent; and the UPCN, with a membership of . per cent (the Government specifies that these percentages have been obtained by taking into account single memberships and leaving out dual memberships, and explains that, in any case, even if the dual memberships were added, the final percentages would not change significantly).
.The Government rejects the accusations made by the complainants and states that not only has the right to freedom of association has been fully respected, but that the ATE has always been accorded all the rights associated with its trade union status, even though it is far from being the union with the most representative status according to its membership figures, and that it has done nothing to prevent the ATE from exercising its right to bargain collectively. Indeed, the ATE itself acknowledges that it signed a collective agreement with the GCBA in , but what it fails to acknowledge is that the GCBA has acted consistently since that time. In this regard, the GCBA sends copies of the collective agreements signed with the ATE up to .
.The authorities point out that, in  and , it was of its own accord that the ATE did not sign any collective agreement, and they deny that the GCBA has not summoned the ATE. The GCBA emphasizes that it has never disregarded the right of the ATE to participate in collective bargaining and neither has it objected to entities banding together in a common cause to represent the collective interests of all workers. However, the trade union organizations with trade union status, far from making common cause, have chosen to express their views and to work separately, without harmonizing their actions. Consequently, the GCBA has been reaching agreements with some of the associations, and has never refused to engage in bargaining through the different forms that these associations have decided to take.
.In this context, the Government points out that the ATE did not make the slightest",0,2018,Argentina
8,"effort to establish collective representation before issuing its unilateral request to initiate a collective bargaining process (the first criterion under law for the determination of common cause is the existence of an agreement between the various trade union associations that wish to participate in the negotiating committee). On the contrary, the ATE has been responsible for many cases of direct action, including in parallel to its calls to negotiate, demonstrating its contempt for the idea of holding a broad and organized dialogue. In this regard, the Government provides detailed information on  cases of direct action staged by the ATE between February  and January , including acts of intimidation ?including the seizure of public buildings and unlawful occupations ?carried out at the same time as it was calling for the urgent convening of the central joint negotiating committee. The Government highlights how the ATE failed in this regard to follow the procedure for the prevention of collective disputes that had been agreed upon in article  of the collective agreement under resolution No. /MHGC/ and specifies that many of these cases of direct action involving work stoppages in the GCBA were based on facts that were partially or totally unconnected to industrial relations.
.The Government adds that despite all this, it acted entirely in good faith and tried to stay out of the evident disputes between the various trade union associations (SUTECBA, the ATE and the UPCN), so that they could take a position on the proposal to close the pay scale for  and draw up a schedule for pay increases for . In this regard, denying the allegation that the ATE was systematically excluded during , the authorities submit a copy of a communication sent to the ATE on  February , calling a meeting, including with ATE members, to discuss, among other issues, collective bargaining for . The Government stresses that the convocation letter was in no way discriminatory and that SUTECBA and the UPCN ?which together represent . per cent of the contributing members ?accepted the invitation. Nevertheless, before providing a formal reply, the ATE (which represents . per cent of contributing members) began publicly to issue calls to direct action. In this context, with the signing of agreements between the GCBA and SUTECBA and the UPCN, and the tacit refusal of the ATE as shown by the direct action it took unilaterally, the negotiations between the Government and the workers?organizations naturally drew to a close. For its part, the ATE, finding itself in disagreement with the other organizations, unilaterally decided to call numerous work stoppages without invoking the aforementioned dispute prevention procedure. The Government considers it paradoxical that the ATE is belatedly ?in other words, after the negotiations have ended ?calling for the establishment of a single negotiating table with all the other trade union associations, while showing a marked disregard for the position that these other associations have already taken and trying, without success, to impose its own will. Consequently, the Government considers it prudent to call on the ATE to reflect and modify its intransigent position and offers to continue to make every effort through the GCBA to improve collective bargaining methods and labour relations in general through dialogue.
.Furthermore, the Government maintains that the allegations of a systematic plan against the ATE in order to undermine its representative status , including the dismissal of delegates, the seizure of trade union premises and challenges to trade union elections are false, reckless and malicious. The Government stresses that these allegations are not backed up by any facts or evidence, and neither are they supported by any reference to their circumstances or to the persons allegedly affected by them. This even precludes the Government from defending itself. The authorities concerned add that it is totally untrue that ATE delegates have been dismissed and they state that the trade union officials elected by the ATE have at all times been granted unpaid leave and the corresponding special trade union protection. The Government also states that it is untrue that the ATE has been deprived of premises and maintains that the GCBA has been respectful of the mandates of the elected delegates and only challenges calls for elections that are made in blatant violation of the regulations in force.
.The Committee notes that the complaint concerns the alleged exclusion of the ATE from collective bargaining for state workers of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, in particular in the central joint negotiating committee.
.The Committee notes that each of the parties claims that the other did not act in good faith to promote collective bargaining in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The complainants accuse the Government of exclusion from the bargaining process and the Government claims that the ATE, despite being representative only to a limited extent, did not follow the agreed dispute prevention procedure and chose to apply unilateral confrontational strategies instead of trying to reach agreements between the parties, which included other unions that, with approximately ten times the membership of the ATE, did participate in the bargaining process and reached an agreement with the Government.
.In this regard and more broadly, the Committee recalls that it is important that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement; moreover genuine and constructive negotiations are a necessary component to establish and maintain a relationship of confidence between the parties [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, Sixth edition, , para. ].
.With regard to the specific case, and although it does not have the elements to examine each of the allegations made between the parties, the Committee notes that, with regard to the allegations of systematic exclusion of the ATE from collective bargaining in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the Government does not deny, but rather repeatedly acknowledges, the rights of participation that the ATE is calling for, and maintains that, even though it is representative only to a limited extent (. per cent of contributing members ?compared to  per cent of the contributing members that are represented by SUTECBA), it is one of the three associations that have been granted trade union status (out of more than  that are operating in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires) to represent all the workers of the GCBA. The Committee also notes that the Government provides evidence of having signed several agreements with the ATE resulting from collective bargaining in  and  (by submitting the relevant minutes) and, with regard to the main allegation of exclusion in , the Government demonstrates that it summoned the ATE to a meeting of the central joint negotiating committee in order to discuss, inter alia, collective bargaining for .
.With regard to the allegation that there is a systematic plan against the ATE aimed at undermining its representative status, which includes the dismissal of delegates, the seizure of trade union premises and challenges to trade union elections, the Committee observes that, as pointed out by the Government, these are general allegations that are unfounded and not backed up by documentary evidence that would enable the Government to respond adequately and the Committee to examine them. In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall that, in order to be able to examine allegations of violations of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining, these should be specified in detail and, as far as possible, accompanied by evidence. In these circumstances, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of this allegation.
.In the light of the foregoing (while welcoming the Governments call for dialogue in order to continue to promote the improvement of collective bargaining methods and industrial relations), the Committee invites the competent authorities to continue to promote collective bargaining in good faith in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires with the different organizations that have recognized trade union status, which is the case of the ATE, in accordance with the applicable legislation and with a view to fostering harmonious industrial relations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee invites the competent authorities to continue to promote collective bargaining in good faith in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires with the different organizations that have recognized trade union status, such as the Association of State Workers (ATE), in accordance with the applicable legislation and with a view to fostering harmonious industrial relations.(b) The Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination and is closed.",-1,2018,Argentina
9,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union Association of Subway and Light Rail Workers (AGTSyP) and the Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA) dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  July  and  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  May , the Trade Union Association of Subway and Light Rail Workers (AGTSyP) and the Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA) state that: (i) the AGTSyP was founded in  as a first-level trade union entity for the workers of the Buenos Aires city subway transport service; (ii) the AGTSyP had to bring the case before the courts to demand that the administrative labour authority grant it trade union registration; and (iii) on  November , the Ministry of Labour issued Decision No./ registering it as a first-level entity. The complainants argue that, with the simple?trade union registration and by having greater worker representation in the sector, it in fact replaced the Automotive Tramway Union (UTA), a first-level association with most representative trade union status representing workers in the public transport and subway passenger sector in Argentina. The complainants indicate that this situation led to tensions and disputes between the unions because the displaced union did not accept its low representativeness among subway workers.
.The complainants indicate that: (i) in view of the AGTSyPs larger membership (,members; around  per cent of overall representation), in accordance with Act No.. on Trade Union Associations, on  July  it applied for most representative trade union status; (ii) the UTA obstructed the application process and filed an appeal with the Ministry of Labour, which was referred to the Labour Chamber; (iii) the Chamber found the appeal inadmissible because it only has jurisdiction over challenges to final administrative decisions; (iv) once the file was referred back to the Ministry of Labour, three verification hearings were held to give both entities the opportunity to prove their membership and thus ascertain the most representative entity, but the UTA failed to appear at any of them and consequently the administrative authority issued Decision No. , granting the AGTSyP most representative trade union status, in the exclusive domain of subway and light rail transport, without affecting the rest of the UTAs most representative trade union status, which it maintained for the remainder of automotive transport; (v) the UTA filed a judicial appeal against the decision granting the trade union status (without providing a single explanation for any grievance regarding this, and especially the reason for its failure to appear at the verification hearings) and, on  March , Chamber ll of the National Chamber for Labour Appeals overturned Decision No.  on the grounds it involved merely formal issues, thus returning to zero the trade union status application process; (vi) the AGTSyP appealed the ruling before the Supreme Court, which did not process the appeal because, following its own doctrine, it deemed it not to be a final ruling or comparable to such? and (vii) the judiciary referred the file back to the Ministry of Labour on  April  and, to date, it remains unresolved, leaving the AGTSyP unable to ever obtain its recognition as the most representative entity.
.The complainants also indicate that the city of Buenos Aires subway concession holder, Metrovas S.A. (hereinafter enterprise A), and the public enterprise Subterrneos de Buenos Aires (SBASE) (hereinafter enterprise B) used the  Supreme Court ruling as an excuse to restrict the AGTSyPs participation in the  wage negotiations. They indicate that, although the Government of the City of Buenos Aires recognized the authority of its representatives to engage in joint wage negotiations, the AGTSyP did not agree with the proposal made by enterprises A and B and was excluded from the negotiating table. They indicate more precisely that the AGTSyP refused to agree to a wage increase below inflation and that the aforementioned enterprises signed an agreement with the UTA that runs counter to the interests of subway workers and even imposes on AGTSyP members a contribution to the UTA equivalent to one per cent of their wages.
.The complainants indicate that: (i) from that moment on, the AGTSyP took two types of action in rotation on the different subway lines in Buenos Aires city: on the one hand, the turnstiles at the entrance to the subway were opened/released (in other words, passengers could use public transport without paying for a ticket) and, on the other hand, the partial and staggered interruption of train services, within certain hours and on specific lines. All these measures were announced in advance; (ii) in a statement dated  May , enterprise A announced the suspension of more than  employees who had taken part in the protests, in response to which the union decided to take more extensive action and, in a statement dated  May , enterprise A indicated that the suspension telegrams were sent because of the action taken to occupy the facilities, open the emergency doors and/or release turnstiles, and stressed that the situation did not violate the right to strike, given that those being sanctioned had taken part in illegal actions; the AGTSyP demanded the reinstatement of the suspended workers and on May the enterprise announced that it had sent more than  suspension telegrams; and (iii) on  May  enterprise A barged in with an army?from the city police infantry guard, on subway line H, which had been suspended due to the strike called by the AGTSyP, repressing the protesting workers at the location with sticks and pepper spray, and arresting  of them, including the joint secretary of the union, Mr. Nstor Segovia, who, as reported by the Buenos Aires city authorities, have had criminal proceedings brought against them and been charged with resisting arrest and undermining authority (section  of the Criminal Code) and interrupting the public transport service (section  of the Criminal Code), which are legal provisions commonly used in Argentina to restrict the right to social protest.
.In its communications of  May and  July  and  September , the Government indicates that the dispute has its origins in an alleged dispute over recognition of trade union representativeness between two unions contesting the representation of workers in the sector, with the courts intervening to settle the dispute. Regarding the trade union status of the AGTSyP, the Government indicates that in a ruling dated  March , the National Chamber for Labour Appeals overturned Ministerial Decision No./, which had granted most representative trade union status to the AGTSyP, on the grounds of various irregularities in the application process. In that ruling (attached by the Government), the Chamber indicated that it was overturning the aforementioned decision and referring the proceedings back to the administrative headquarters so that, once the formal irregularities had been rectified, it could rule again on the issue at hand (the granting of most representative trade union status). The Government indicates that these administrative proceedings have been suspended due to the pandemic (during  administrative proceedings were suspended) and that they have recently been resumed, both entities having been ordered to forward the documentation submitted by each, for reciprocal recognition or to deal with any other issue on the matter. The Government considers this to be a dispute between two trade union organizations referred to the courts, which the ministry has been ordered to deal with in a certain way, and it is therefore no longer a matter involving the Government.
.Furthermore, the Government indicates that the industrial action carried out by the union in  affected subway traffic in the City of Buenos Aires for more than  days and considers that the grievance should have been settled in another way, as it had had a detrimental effect on normal transit and traffic and even on the safety of citizens travelling to and from their work or homes.
.Regarding the alleged arrest of  workers and the trade union leader, the Government states that it has attached a report from the Ministry of Security of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires, which indicates that the protesters interrupted the enterprises subway service line, preventing normal traffic on the system and operations, and that, when police personnel requested a dialogue, most of the protesters dispersed, while others locked themselves in the drivers?cabs. The report also indicates that, in this situation, the Intercommunal Transit Security Directorate intervened to protect worker and passenger safety, making the protesters come out of the cabs, who were then detained for infringement of article  of the Contravention Code and for undermining authority and resisting arrest. The Government indicates that the case is being handled by the prosecutors office No. , which is responsible for contraventions and misdemeanours (Fiscala Contravencional), headed by Dr. Daniela Dupuy, Secretary, and Dr.Tomas Vaccarezza, under File No. /.
.The Government attaches",0,2018,Argentina
10,"a copy of an agreement concluded between the Undersecretariat for Labour of the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the AGTSyP and enterprises A and B, dated  April . The Undersecretariat for Labour also reports that it is engaging in dialogue with this association on a regular basis and at the latters request.
.The Committee notes that the present case concerns, on the one hand, allegations relating to the delay in the granting of most representative trade union status to the complainant organization AGTSyP (representing workers in the Buenos Aires city subway service) and, on the other hand, allegations relating to police repression, suspensions and arrests of workers who took part in protests and industrial action.
.Regarding the most representative trade union status, the Committee notes that, according to the allegations: (i) the AGTSyP was founded in , obtained its trade union registration in  and applied for most representative trade union status in ; and (ii) although in  the ministry granted it most representative trade union status (in the exclusive domain of subway and light rail transport), the UTA (a first-level association with most representative trade union status representing workers in the public transport and subway passenger sector in Argentina) filed administrative and judicial appeals. To date, the trade union status application process has not been completed (the National Chamber for Labour Appeals overturned the ministerial decision to grant most representative trade union status due to irregularities in the application process and the Supreme Court did not process the appeal, referring the file back to the ministry on  April , and since then it has remained unresolved).
.In this respect, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, (i) the dispute has its origins in an alleged dispute over recognition of trade union representativeness between two unions contesting the representation of workers in the sector; (ii) in a ruling dated  March , the National Chamber for Labour Appeals overturned Ministerial Decision No. / (which had granted most representative trade union status to the AGTSyP), on the grounds of various irregularities in the application process and referred the proceedings back to the administrative headquarters so that, once the formal irregularities had been rectified, it could rule again on the issue at hand; and (iii) these administrative proceedings have been suspended due to the pandemic and have recently been resumed, both entities having been ordered to forward the documentation submitted by each, for reciprocal recognition or to deal with any other issue on the matter.
.While taking due note of the Governments indication that the administrative proceedings have been suspended as a result of the pandemic, the Committee observes that the application process was initiated in  and that the ruling of the National Chamber for Labour Appeals, to which the Government refers, dates from . It also notes that, according to the complainants, the AGTSyP appealed this ruling before the Supreme Court (which did not process the appeal) and that the latter referred the file back to the Ministry of Labour on April . In other words, the application process for most representative trade union status, for which the Government has responsibility, has been pending a decision at the administrative level since the beginning of .
.While recalling that a matter involving no dispute between the Government and the trade unions, but which involves a conflict within the trade union movement itself, is the sole responsibility of the parties themselves [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ], the Committee however observes that the allegation in this case concerns the lengthiness of the procedure for obtaining trade union status following the remand of the matter to the Ministry of Labour. In this regard, the Committee recalls that where administrative decisions on the granting or revocation of most representative trade union status are challenged, the administrative and judicial proceedings need to take place without delay. The Committee recalls that there are other cases where it has already examined problems and delays similar to those described in the present complaint [see, for example, th report, paras ?, or th report, paras ?]. Taking due note of the Governments indication that the administrative proceedings have recently been resumed, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of any decision taken in this respect.
.With regard to the allegation that, in the context of the action taken by the AGTSyP in  (opening of turnstiles at the entrance to the subway and partial and staggered interruption of train services), enterprise A had suspended more than  workers and the police had repressed (with sticks and pepper spray) and arrested  of them, including the joint secretary of the AGTSyP, who allegedly had criminal proceedings brought against them, the Committee notes that: (i) as indicated in the complaint, enterprise A has stated that it did not infringe the right to strike and that it suspended those who had taken part in illegal actions such as the occupation of facilities, the opening of emergency doors and/or the release of turnstiles; and (ii) the Government indicates that subway traffic in City of Buenos Aires had been affected for more than  days and that when the police requested a dialogue most of the demonstrators dispersed or locked themselves in the drivers?cabs and the authorities intervened to protect worker and passenger safety, making the protesters come out of the cabs, who were then detained for infringement of article  of the Contravention Code (which provides for sanctions to be imposed on persons who intentionally interfere with public services such as transport) and for undermining authority and resisting arrest.
.The Committee notes that the Government has failed to provide more detailed information in this respect, or to inform it whether, following the arrests, the workers and trade unionists concerned were held accountable in any way or sanctions imposed on them, or whether any judicial proceedings were instituted in this regard. The Committee recalls that, on numerous occasions, where the complainants alleged that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments?replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations [see Compilation, para. ]. In light of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of any judicial proceedings that may have been instituted in relation to the workers who were arrested.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that, as reported by the Government, on  April  the Undersecretariat for Labour of the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the AGTSyP and the enterprises agreed on a retroactive adjustment to the wage scale and also agreed that the joint wage negotiations for the period from  March  to  February  were concluded and that no issues remained outstanding. The Committee notes that the Government has attached a copy of this agreement. The Committee also notes and welcomes the Governments indication that the Undersecretariat for Labour is engaging in dialogue with the AGTSyP on a regular basis and at the latters request.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Taking due note of the Governments indication that the administrative proceedings have recently been resumed, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of any decision taken in this respect.(b) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of any judicial proceedings that may have been instituted in relation to the workers who were arrested.",0,2018,Argentina
11,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Education Workers of the Republic of Argentina (CTERA) dated March .
.The Government provided its observations in communications dated  March and October  and  March .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No.), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of March , the complainants allege that the Provincial Education Council (CPE) of Santa Cruz province, in retaining trade union dues, restricting the right to strike, drawing up blacklists, delaying granting trade union leave and unilaterally modifying collective agreements, systematically violated the trade union and collective bargaining rights of the Teachers?Association of Santa Cruz (ADOSAC).
.First, the complainants allege that, despite the fact that the CPE has continued to deduct agreed trade union dues, since , it has not been depositing the corresponding amounts into the ADOSAC bank account, or it has done so only in part or in a belated manner. They state that in March  teaching staff were owed, in the form of trade union dues, a total of ,, Argentine pesos (ARS). They state that on an individual level, the undue retention of trade union dues undermines the salary of workers and violates the wishes of workers by denying their ability to join or be a member of the trade union of their choice. At the collective level, the failure to transfer the funds infringes the financial autonomy of the trade union organization, blocking its access to funds to carry out its trade union activities. According to the complainants, this behaviour constitutes interference by the State authorities who have a dual role as both employer and withholding agent. They also allege the CPEs refusal to transmit the relevant documents under their mandate relating to the collection of trade union dues, which would prevent the trade union organization from taking the appropriate legal action.
.Second, the complainants denounce the limitation of the right to strike through the imposition of a compulsory conciliation and, subsequently, the imposition of a large fine by the labour administration of Santa Cruz province. They indicate that, in March , when faced with the constant retention of trade union dues or the partial payment of those dues, the ADOSAC notified the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (hereafter, Ministry of Labour) of the aforementioned province of the direct action to be taken. They explain that that notification led to resolution No.  of  April , through which the Ministry of Labour ordered compulsory conciliation between the parties in order to prevent the ADOSAC from exercising the right to strike. The complainants state that the ADOSAC lodged an appeal with the Ministry of Labour to annul resolution No.  on the grounds of the violation of due process and conflict of interest, and that the appeal was rejected on  April . The complainants state that, faced with ongoing direct action, the Ministry of Labour, on  December , issued resolution No. , which ordered the trade union to pay a fine of approximately ,, pesos, and threatened that the amount would be recovered through legal proceedings if the amount was not paid within three working days. They state that the ADOSAC submitted an administrative appeal claiming that the fine was unconstitutional, and that on  February , the Ministry rejected the appeal.
.The complainants consider that the Ministry of Labour, as a public administrative body of the province, does not have the impartiality required to take on the role of mediator in the dispute. According to the complainants, the compulsory conciliation order was not an independent and impartial procedure, nor did it inspire confidence in the parties. They consider that the labour administration, on the one hand, ignored the persistent claims of the trade union body regarding the retention of trade union dues by the CPE, and, on the other hand, it supported the attitude of the provincial government, fully invalidating the mechanism that orders compulsory conciliation. Similarly, they consider that, while the ILO allows limitations to be placed on the right to strike in public administrations, this right may not be restricted by the actions of an administrative body that is only implementing the wishes of one of the parties. The trade union organizations also highlight the persecutory nature of the behaviour of the administrative authority, which, in their opinion, with the imposition of a fine of more than  million pesos, sought to financially choke the ADOSAC, hindering the performance of this trade union organization and preventing it from carrying out its trade union activities. Furthermore, they state that the labour authority is not empowered to issue fines against trade union organizations and that, in addition, the legislative measures used to sanction the complainant organization are intended to be used against employers and not workers.
.Third, the complainants allege a delay in trade union leave being granted to the elected executive committee of the ADOSAC. They explain that on  January , the executive committee took office (they were elected on  October ), and although one month had elapsed since the notification had been given, the relevant trade union leave had not been granted, and it was only on  March  that the elected representatives could begin to work freely. In light of the foregoing, they consider that the delay in granting leave to the legitimate representatives of the workers so that they could carry out their trade union roles constitutes a violation of the protection of trade union representatives and a restriction of the exercise of freedom of association.
.Fourth, the complainants allege that, as a result of the direct action, on  March  the CPE ordered educational establishments to communicate the list of staff involved in the direct action called for by the ADOSAC and the Association of Technical Educators (AMET) on  and  March . Subsequently, in July , in light of the ongoing measures to exert pressure by the teaching staff, educational establishments were requested to provide monthly lists of staff members?absences. The complainants allege that, on both occasions, the educational establishments were informed that the failure to comply would lead to administrative and criminal sanctions, and they consider that any such absence records were to be used to create blacklists. They state that the CPE specifically intimidated the directors of the educational establishments warning them that, as a result of their leadership position, they were not able to join the direct action. The complainants point out that the Committee on Freedom of Association has indicated on various occasions that nobody should be penalized or discriminated against for carrying out or attempting to carry out a legitimate strike, and that furthermore, the imposition of criminal penalties as a result of strike action is incompatible with the right to freedom of association.
.Lastly, the complainants allege the violation of the right to collective bargaining by the employer. They explain that, when faced with the provincial governments refusal to initiate collective bargaining procedures to negotiate wages and working conditions, the ADOSAC called on the national Government to intervene. The national Government, through an agreement dated  August , made funds available to the CPE authorities for a proposed wage increase of  per cent in August , which would gradually increase, reaching a wage increase of  per cent in December . They allege that the national Government, together with the CPE, would have ceased to comply with the wage increase agreed in the collective agreement mentioned above as of December . In addition, they allege that on  December , the CPE issued resolution No./ which ordered the revocation of resolution No. /. The complainants allege that resolution No. / is not only an illegal regression, but also supersedes collective bargaining, as resolution No. / was the result of the collective bargaining as noted in the reports dated  November,  November,  December and  December , and  March . Therefore, the complainants consider that the CPE may not unilaterally modify a condition agreed through collective bargaining, and that, by doing so, it violates the principles of collective bargaining.
.In its communications dated  March,  October  and  March , the Government states, with regard to the alleged retention of trade union dues owed to the ADOSAC, that the payment of amounts of money to the trade union body is usually made in due time and form. However, it admits that a delay may have occurred in some months, particularly during the period in which teaching and administrative staff were carrying out direct actions, and it is investigating the possible debt owed to the trade union body through an assessment carried out by a technical team, and that, once that work is completed, the alleged debt would be credited, if required. It emphasizes that approximately million pesos are transferred on an annual",5,2018,Argentina
12,"basis in the form of trade union dues, and therefore the possible reclaimed debt is insignificant for the purposes of determining a violation of freedom of association.
.Concerning the alleged restriction on the right to strike by means of compulsory conciliation, as well as by the imposition of the fine by the provincial Ministry of Labour, the Government points out that the dispute with the ADOSAC is long-standing and that, since , that trade union organization has carried out strikes that have led to the loss of some school periods of more than  days for the children. The Government states that there are records of the overreach of the exercise of the right to strike by that trade union organization, such as the seizure of public buildings and oil fields, as well as of the fact that compulsory conciliation measures were not complied with by the trade union (court case No. /). In the Governments opinion, the principles of freedom of association do not protect against overreaches in the exercise of the right to strike that result in criminal actions. Additionally, it states that school establishments operate as canteens, such that their closure for a long period of time causes harm both in terms of education as well as in terms of the psychophysical impact on its users, since the direct-action measures prevent the provinces most vulnerable children and adolescents from accessing food that cannot be provided by their families. Furthermore, those actions also have repercussions on the working life of the childrens parents and guardians, given that, when they are not able to send the children to school, they are forced to find alternatives in order to reconcile their work and family obligations. The Government states that, in case No. , the Committee on Freedom of Association recognized the importance of school canteens in the order for compulsory conciliation and emphasizes that the situation was even considered by the family courts, which have intervened to order the cessation of direct actions for the benefit of students. In light of the above, the Government considers that the above-mentioned reasons constitute a reasonable restriction on the right to strike and emphasizes that, to date, no trade union organization has questioned the constitutional nature of the administrative laws that regulate labour procedures and of those that establish that the Ministry of Labour is the highest labour authority in Santa Cruz province.
.With specific reference to the compulsory conciliation order referred to by the complainants (resolution No. /), the Government states that: (i) the right to strike is not absolute, in particular, when the direct action is of extended duration and infringes other rights, such as the right to education; (ii) provincial Act No.  establishes that the Ministry of Labour is the administrative authority responsible for collective bargaining and has the authority to use compulsory conciliation; and (iii) provincial Act No.  establishes that the parties should report to the administrative authority any dispute that arises between the parties before resorting to direct action, and that in cases where there is an order for compulsory conciliation, the parties are not allowed to take direct action. However, the Government considers that it is unreasonable to suggest, as the complainants do, that the compulsory conciliation ordered under current national legislation may undermine the freedom of association or the exercise of the right to strike, given that that compulsory conciliation process lasts a maximum of days, and once that period has expired, the trade union authorities are legitimately empowered to carry out the actions that they consider to be appropriate. With regard to the fine, which is under the enforcement procedure, the Government considers that the ADOSACs failure to respect the ordered compulsory conciliation brought consequences in the form of an investigation being opened into the violation of articles  and  of Act No.  on the grounds of obstruction of the labour authority, and denies that the workers?right to association was impaired at any time. In this regard, it reports that the ADOSAC lodged an appeal under article  of the National Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure, which was not successful because the previous provision that establishes the relevant regulation had not been complied with. Subsequently, it submitted an appeal that expired on February  as a result of the inaction of the appellant.
.With regard to the alleged keeping of blacklists in retaliation for exercising the right to strike, the Government states that the keeping of absence records for teaching and other staff is the responsibility of the CPE and that this is carried out by the directors of each institution and is one of the inherent duties of their position. The Government states that, in the contentious climate between the employer and the trade union, the CPE identified several acts, such as the falsification of attendance records, the submission of incorrect information to the data loading system and other behaviours, which led to disciplinary actions being issued by that body. Furthermore, the Government considers that the complainants are attempting to make the directors?duty to fulfil a requirement into alleged persecution, which does not have any factual or legal basis, and it categorically denies the existence of blacklists.
.With regard to the delay in granting leave to members of the executive committee of the ADOSAC, the Government states that this was due to the fact that one of its elected members, Mr Ral Amancio Viltes, held a position of first majority elected member in the Primary Education Classification Board, and it was necessary for him to resign that position in order to take up the position of administrative secretary of the ADOSAC. In light of that, the Government considers that the delay in granting leave was not the result of a violation of trade union rights but rather an administrative matter that was caused by the irregular situation of one of its members.
.With regard to the alleged infringement on collective bargaining, the Government explains that, given the extensive dispute between the province and the teaching sector, which resulted from the demands for wage increases that Santa Cruz province was not in a financial position to accept, the national Government agreed to provide funds. It explains that the  per cent that had been agreed initially was paid using national funds in the period from December  to March . Subsequently, and with the interruption in the remittance of funds by the national Government, the province had no choice but to interrupt its compliance with the previously agreed obligation. In this context, and in order to resolve the non-compliance, Act No. / of  December  established that the debt, which resulted from the national Governments failure to provide funds, would begin to be paid alongside the salary corresponding to the month of December , such that the  per cent corresponding to the month of April  would be paid together with the  per cent corresponding to the month of December , and so forth, until the entire debt was paid. The Government explains that the failure to send funds was a result of the economic crisis being faced by the country, and even though this claim is no longer relevant since an agreement has been reached between the bodies involved, it considers that the trade union representatives had an abusive attitude.
.With regard to resolution No. /, the Government states that the issuance of the aforementioned resolution meant for the CPE the reestablishment of the legal order that had been broken with the issue of resolution No. /. According to the Government, the resolution in question only benefited seven teachers, who, when they were informed of the issue of resolution No. , filed amparo actions. The Government indicates that, despite the fact that the courts of first and second instance declared that resolution to be invalid, they ruled in favour of maintaining the fictitious employment situation on the grounds that the CPE does not have the authority to revoke its own actions; thus, the salaries earned by these workers under resolution No. / were protected and the CPE would only be able to re-establish the previous legal order through a revocation order. Therefore, the Government considers that since this matter has been resolved by the courts, it is considered to be res judicata, and it states that, in December , the CPE filed a revocation order with the High Court of Justice. Lastly, the Government considers that this complaint is a victimization attempt by the ADOSAC and an attempt to avoid paying the fine for not complying with the administrative resolutions that were issued, which, as of October , remains pending.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainants allege a series of violations of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in the public education sector of Santa Cruz province (retention of trade union dues, restrictions on the right to strike through the imposition of compulsory conciliation and a fine, alleged keeping of blacklists, delay in granting trade union",3,2018,Argentina
13,"leave and restrictions on the right to collective bargaining).
.Regarding the alleged retention of trade union dues, the Committee takes note of the fact that the complainants contend that, despite the fact that the provincial Government has continued to deduct trade union dues, since , it has not deposited the corresponding amounts in the ADOSAC bank account, or it has done so only in part or in a belated manner, and that until March  teaching staff were owed more than  million Argentine pesos (ARS) in the form of trade union dues. Alongside this, the complainants allege that the CPE refuses to transmit certain documents under their mandate relating to the retention of trade union dues, which would prevent the trade union organizations from taking the appropriate legal action. The Committee observes that the Government, for its part, recognizes that there may have been a delay in the payment of some amounts, particularly during the months in which the teachers carried out direct action. It indicates that it is investigating the possible debt with the body, and that that the amount will be credited if required, and it emphasizes that approximately  million pesos are transferred on an annual basis in the form of trade union dues, and therefore the possible reclaimed debt is insignificant compared to determining whether there has been a violation of freedom of association. The Committee recalls that in a case in which the authorities had not transferred to the trade union concerned the dues that had been deducted from the wages of public officials, the Committee considered that trade union dues did not belong to the authorities, nor were they public funds, but rather they were an amount on deposit that the authorities may not use for any reason other than to remit them to the organization concerned without delay [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Taking note of the Governments indications that it is investigating the possible debt to the ADOSAC, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to clarify, as soon as possible, whether there is a debt, and that, if so, to remit the amounts owed immediately.
.With regard to the restriction on the right to strike through compulsory conciliation and the subsequent imposition of a fine by the provincial labour administration, the Committee notes that both the complainants and the Government stated that, after the ADOSAC informed of its intention to carry out direct action, the Ministry of Labour of the province, by means of resolution No.  of  April , ordered compulsory conciliation and that when the direct action continued, the provincial labour administration ordered the ADOSAC to pay a fine of approximately . million pesos. The Committee notes the allegations of the complainant organizations that: (i) the Ministry of Labour, as a public administrative body of the province, does not have the impartiality required to take on the role of mediator in the dispute; (ii) while the Committee on Freedom of Association accepts restrictions on the exercise of the right to strike, this right may not be restricted by the actions of an administrative body that only acts on behalf of one of the parties; (iii) the Ministry of Labour is not empowered to issue fines; and (iv) the excessive amount of the fine that was issued seeks to financially choke the ADOSAC and prevent it from carrying out its trade union activities. The Committee notes that the Government states, for its part, that: (i) the dispute with the ADOSAC is long-standing; (ii) there are records of the overreach of the exercise of the right to strike and the failure to comply with compulsory conciliation measures by this union; (iii) the right to strike is not absolute, in particular when the direct action is of extended duration, infringing other rights, and that since , the trade union organization has carried out strikes that have led to the loss of some school periods of more than  days; (iv) schools in the province operate as canteens, such that their closure causes harm in terms of education and the psychophysical impact on its users; (v) the Committee on Freedom of Association has recognized the importance of school canteens in the compulsory conciliation order and the family courts even intervened to rule that direct action should be terminated; (vi) no trade union organization has questioned the constitutional nature of the administrative laws that regulate labour procedures and of those that establish that the Ministry of Labour is the highest labour authority in Santa Cruz province; (vii) provincial Act No.  on Administrative Procedure establishes that, during the period of compulsory conciliation, no direct action may be carried out; (viii) it was the failure to comply with this measure that led to the issue of a fine for obstructing the labour authority; (ix) it would not seem reasonable to suggest, as the complainants do, that the compulsory conciliation ordered under current national legislation may undermine freedom of association or the exercise of the right to strike, given that the compulsory conciliation process lasts a maximum of  days, and once that period has expired, the trade union authorities are legitimately empowered to carry out the actions that they consider to be appropriate; and (x) the appeal filed by the ADOSAC against the fine was unsuccessful because the previous provision that establishes the relevant regulation had not been complied with and the appeal submitted by the union had expired as a result of the inaction of the appellant.
.While noting that the provision of food to school-age children can be considered to be an essential service [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee recalls that the allegations in this case refer to restrictions on the right to strike in the education sector in general, and not only to the provision of food. In this regard, while noting the concerns expressed by the Government regarding the extended duration of the strike in the education sector and the possible impact that those measures may have on the education or the psychophysical health of children and adolescents, given that schools in the province operate as canteens, the Committee also recalls that, on previous occasions, it has previously pointed out that minimum services may be established in the education sector, in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strikes of long duration [see Compilation, para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that in recent years, it has examined several cases from Argentina involving objections to orders for compulsory conciliation between the parties to a dispute in the public education sector by the administrative authority, when the latter was a party in the dispute, and that it has considered that it would be desirable to entrust the decision of initiating the conciliation procedure in collective disputes to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute [see Compilation, para. ; th Report, Case No. , para.]. The Committee further recalls that conciliation and mediation machinery should have the sole purpose of facilitating bargaining and should not be so complex or slow that a lawful strike becomes impossible in practice or loses its effectiveness [see Compilation, para.]. The Committee, while observing that the stoppages of activities of the complainant organization of Santa Cruz have been long standing and of long duration, which has affected the level of education and the provision of food in schools to minors, considers that in this case the education service is essential. In this regard, the Committee considers that the call made by the administrative authority to put forward a compulsory conciliation procedure between the parties, prior to the strike, is reasonable with the superior protection of minors in their school meals and timely education. It is also proportionate to the claims pursued by the complainant organization of Santa Cruz, inasmuch as it pursues the resolution of the dispute through social dialogue, without undermining the possibility of the exercise of the strike. With regard to the imposition of a fine, while considering that the fines must be proportionate to the events that led to their imposition, the Committee notes that it was due to the failure of the complainant organization to comply with an order of the administrative authority, derived from the application of the legislation in force in the province of Santa Cruz, and that the decision was appealed by the union, which by not complying with the procedural requirements and by failing in its procedural activity, led to the failure of the appeal. In light of the above circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this matter.
.With regard to the allegation that blacklists were being kept subsequent to the strike action, the Committee notes that the complainants allege that in March  and July  the CPE ordered educational establishments to provide the list of staff members participating in the direct action or staff absence records, indicating that any non-compliance would carry administrative and criminal sanctions. The",-1,2018,Argentina
14,"Committee notes that, according to the complainants, those absence records were used to create blacklists and were therefore inconsistent with freedom of association. They further allege that the CPE specifically intimidated the directors of administrative establishments, warning them that they were not able to participate in the direct action because of their positions. The Committee also takes note of the observations of the Government which state that: (i) recording attendance of teachers and administrative staff is one of the duties of the CPE, which is implemented through the directors of each institution; (ii) while the direct action measures were ongoing, the CPE recorded several acts, including the falsification of absence records and the submission of incorrect information to the attendance system, which triggered a series of disciplinary actions; and (iii) it categorically denies the allegations of persecution and elaboration of blacklists. Observing that an employers determination of which workers have exercised their right to strike and which have performed their roles could be legitimate and does not constitute in itself an anti-union act, and noting in addition that the complainants have not provided specific points relating to the use of this information for anti-union purposes, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further.
.With regard to the alleged delay in granting trade union leave to the executive committee of the ADOSAC, which took office on  January , the Committee notes that the complainants allege that the delay of two months in granting leave constituted a violation of the protection of trade union immunity. The Committee notes that the Government, for its part, indicates that the delay was due to the fact that one of the elected members held a position of first majority elected member in the Primary Education Classification Board, and it was necessary for him to resign that position in order to join the executive committee of the ADOSAC. Noting that the complainants do not refer in their allegations to specific actions that are anti-union in nature against the members of the executive committee of the ADOSAC, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the allegation of infringements on the right to collective bargaining, the Committee notes that the complainants allege, first, that the CPE had failed to comply, from December , with the wage increases agreed in the agreement dated  August , which provided for a wage increase of  per cent in August , gradually increasing until a wage increase of  per cent was reached in December . The Committee notes that the Government states that the interruption in funds was a result of the economic crisis being faced by the country and that it established, by means of Act No. / of  December , that the debt resulting from the failure to remit funds by the national Government would be paid back from December . Taking note of the Governments observation that Act No. / provided for the payment of the debt resulting from the failure to remit funds, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further.
.With regard to the allegation of infringements on the right to collective bargaining caused by the issue of resolution No. /, the Committee notes that the complainants allege that the action of the CPE, by issuing that resolution and revoking resolution No. /, the content of which had been negotiated through collective bargaining, had constituted an unlawful regression and that the CPE had unilaterally modified previously negotiated agreements, threatening the principles of collective bargaining. The Committee understands, according to publicly available information, that as part of the reorganization of the public education system in Santa Cruz province, the provincial Government had issued resolution No. /, which committed to paying the salary of those teachers who, as a result of the reorganization had lost their positions and to placing them in technical pedagogical positions until they could be effectively relocated. It also understands that resolution No. / sought to revoke resolution No. / and discharge the teachers who were benefiting from that resolution. The Committee notes that the Government states that: (i) resolution No./ is limited to re-establishing the previous legal order; (ii) resolution No. / only benefited seven teachers; (iii) the teachers affected by the resolution submitted an amparo action; (iv) the court of second instance, despite the fact that resolution No. / was declared to be invalid, ruled in favour of maintaining the fictitious employment situation created by that resolution on the grounds that the CPE does not have the authority to revoke its own actions, and that that body could only re-establish the previous legal order through a revocation order; and (v) in December , the CPE submitted an request for a revocation order with the High Court of Justice. The Committee also recalls that mutual respect for the commitment undertaken in collective agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground [see Compilation, para. ]. Noting that the CPE filed a revocation order with the High Court of Justice, and that that action is pending, the Committee requests that the Government inform it of the decision that is handed down in this regard.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged retention of trade union dues, the Committee requests that the Government should determine the trade union dues owed and take the necessary measures to return the trade union dues to the trade union organization and to keep it informed in that regard.(b) With regard to the alleged infringements on the right to collective bargaining arising from the issue of resolution No. /, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision that is handed down relating to the revocation order filed by the Provincial Education Council (CPE) with the High Court of Justice.",2,2018,Argentina

.The Government sent observations in communications dated  September  and July .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No.), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  August and  December , the complainant organization indicates that it is a merely registered?(simplemente inscripta) primary-level organization in the judicial sector. The AEFPJN alleges that the National Supreme Court of Justice (Supreme Court), as the employer, did not accept or even consider the unions request for deduction at source (check-off) of its members?union dues. This refusal was communicated through Administrative Decision No. /, which the Supreme Court based on internal regulations, especially section  of the Trade Unions Act (No. , which only grants this prerogative to trade unions possessing trade union status (personera gremial). According to the complainant, this decision was issued after more than five years of formalities, requests and legal action by the AEFPJN.
.The complainant alleges that there is a restriction on the exercise of collective bargaining, in that the Supreme Court never convened or agreed to a meeting with the unions officers. The AEFPJN also considers that the Supreme Court has shown discrimination towards it in not inviting it to take part in discussions on matters of institutional importance. As an example, it mentions the discussions on income tax, which were attended by many representative bodies as well as the entity having trade union status but to which AEFPJN representatives were not admitted on the grounds that they belonged to a merely registered union.
.In general, the complainant alleges that since it was established (in ) the union has never been received by the authorities or by representatives of the employer (the Supreme Court) despite numerous requests for a meeting made by various means. It affirms that the Supreme Court provides no information to the AEFPJN and that no invitation has been made to engage in any dialogue between the parties. The AEFPJN emphasizes that this lack of dialogue makes it impossible to address topics or issues of common interest.
.The AEFPJN indicates that, as a result of the foregoing, it has instituted several legal proceedings against the Supreme Court, in particular regarding the deduction of union dues at source (check-off), and also regarding other requests it (the complainant) has made to which it claims not to have received any reply (regarding the number of workers with disabilities in the judiciary, the implementation of safety and health policies, overtime payments and increases in staff numbers). The complainant regrets the fact that, in view of the lack of dialogue, it is obliged to institute long and costly legal proceedings.
.In its communications of  September  and  July  the Government provides observations relating to the allegations made.
.With regard to the allegation of non-authorization of the deduction of union dues, the Government criticizes the complainant organization for having recourse to an international body before exhausting its claims at the national level. The Government states that the administrative statement made by the Court in  rejecting the request through Administrative Decision No. / in no way implied a pronouncement by the Supreme Court on the constitutionality of the applied legislation (the Trade Unions Act). The Government states that because of the administrative function the Court was unable to revise the legislation concerned at that time and it considers that the complainant should have filed the plea for declaration of unconstitutionality of section  of the Trade Unions Act at the outset.
.In this regard, the Government states that, as a result of the amparo (protection of constitutional rights) appeal lodged by the complainant challenging the constitutionality of section : (i) the National First-Instance Labour Court No.  dismissed the action brought by the complainant; (ii) however, this ruling was appealed against and Chamber I of the National Labour Appeals Court decided, on  April , to overturn the initial ruling and instruct the Supreme Court to implement measures to grant the AEFPJN a code for the deduction of assets in its capacity as withholding agent for amounts paid by members as union dues. In its ruling the National Appeals Chamber, with regard to the specific case, declared section  of the Trade Unions Act to be unconstitutional and referred to past decisions of the Supreme Court itself and to previous recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association and of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR), which had emphasized that the said legislation (including restricting the deduction of union dues to organizations possessing trade union status) was not in conformity with the rights and principles established in ILO Convention No. .
.With regard to the allegations of lack of information, lack of dialogue and lack of negotiation with the employer, the Government indicates that: (i) the AEFPJN is a minor union, with only  members; (ii) in the complaint the complainant does not dispute this question or mention the launching of any assessment process to seek the status of an organization having trade union status; (iii) as a merely registered union, the AEFPJN does not have the representativeness needed to engage in collective bargaining; (iv) the other legal proceedings cited in the complaint are not concerned with issues related to the collective rights of judiciary workers, and with regard to one of these cases the labour commission referred to never existed; and (v) the Government is always open to social dialogue, which should be cooperative, transparent and wide-ranging, and this does not imply disregarding certain powers of the most representative organizations but clearly identifying entities that have the capacity to engage in collective representation.
.The Committee notes that in the present complaint the complainant denounces the non-authorization of the deduction at source (check-off) of its members?union dues, and alleges a lack of information, dialogue and negotiation on the part of the Supreme Court as the employer.
.The Committee observes that one of the key issues of the complaint was resolved in favour of the complainant by a judicial decision which, recalling previous Supreme Court decisions and also pronouncements of the ILO supervisory bodies, in particular the Committee on Freedom of Association (Case No. ), considered the restriction of the check-off facility for union dues to trade unions possessing trade union status as unconstitutional and contrary to freedom of association. The Committee duly notes that this ruling instructed the Supreme Court to take steps to grant the AEFPJN a code for the deduction of assets in its capacity as withholding agent for its members?union dues.
.The Committee recalls that even though systems of collective bargaining with exclusive rights for the most representative trade union and those where it is possible for a number of collective agreements to be concluded by a number of trade unions within a company are both compatible with the principles of freedom of association, where the law of a country draws a distinction between the most representative trade union and other trade unions, such a system should not have the effect of preventing minority unions from functioning and at least having the right to make representations on behalf of their members and to represent them in cases of individual grievances [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ].
.The Committee observes that the complainant does not demonstrate or claim sufficient representativeness to be able to engage in collective bargaining under the system of most representative organizations (that is, those having trade union status) established by the national legislation. The Committee also observes that although the Government emphasizes that the AEFPJN is a merely registered trade union, it does not deny the lack of dialogue with the employer referred to by the complaint.
.In light of the foregoing, the Committee invites the authorities concerned to promote dialogue with the complainant organization in accordance with the national legislation.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee invites the authorities concerned to promote dialogue with the complainant organization in accordance with the national legislation.",0,2017,Argentina
16,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  January  from the Association of Professional Judicial Staff (APPJ). It is supported by the Argentine Federation of Management Staff Associations. The APPJ sent additional information related to the complaint in communications dated  October and  November .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May  and  July .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  January,  October and  November , the APPJ states that it is a forum for professionals working for the judiciary and/or the Public Prosecutors Office in the Province of Buenos Aires in a dependent employment relationship. It has simple trade union status and is affiliated with the Argentine Federation of Management Staff Associations. The complainant alleges acts of anti-union discrimination against the Secretary-General of the APPJ (in the Province of Buenos Aires) (instituting legal proceedings with the aim of dismissing him and not granting him trade union leave) as well as against the APPJ (refusing dialogue and refusing to allow it to participate in collective bargaining), by the employer, the Attorney Generals Office of the Supreme Court of Justice in the Province of Buenos Aires.
.The complainant states that an assembly of APPJ members was held in November  and the Secretary-General was tasked with requesting recognition of one rest day per week from the Criminal Public Prosecutors in the Province of Buenos Aires, because the workers represented by the APPJ are required to work continuously for two weeks without weekly rest days whenever the Criminal Public Prosecutors Office that they work for is on duty. According to the complaint: (i) as a result of this, the Secretary-General sent official letters to several Criminal Public Prosecutors Offices and requested them to recognize one rest day per week; (ii) the Public Prosecutors Offices consulted on the matter with their supervisors, the General Public Prosecutors Office in the San Martn Judicial Department, which directed them not to recognize that right; (iii) in light of the foregoing, the APPJ requested, by means of a letter written by the Secretary-General, that the General Public Prosecutors Office cease its anti-union activity; and (iv) in response to that request, a disproportionate, illegitimate and illegal persecution and pressure campaign began, by bringing administrative proceedings against the Secretary-General of the APPJ for matters unconnected with his work, which had the ultimate aim of removing him from his job and from his trade union leadership role.
.The complainant alleges that, by taking disciplinary measures against the Secretary-General, the Attorney Generals Office of the Supreme Court of Justice in the Province of Buenos Aires is taking de facto measures against assembly decisions enacted by the Secretary General and, therefore, interfering in the institutional life of the APPJ. The complainant also alleges that, by arguing that the APPJ does not have trade union status, the Secretary-General has been denied trade union leave. It is also alleged that, while the Attorney Generals Office refuses to hold dialogue with the APPJ and does not respond to numerous requests, preference is given to a non-profit civil association: the College of Judges and Clerks in the Province of Buenos Aires. The complainant adds that the Ministry of Labour in the Province of Buenos Aires passed a resolution stating that, because it does not have trade union status, the APPJ cannot participate in collective bargaining.
.The complainant states that on  July  it lodged a complaint with the legal authority for unfair practices, in which it alleged, among other things: failure to hold dialogue; refusal to allow the APPJ to participate in collective bargaining; failure to submit the list of workers in order to designate staff delegates; and failure to hold periodic meetings with delegates. In its communication of  November , the complainant reports that this complaint was rejected in its entirety in a ruling handed down on  October  and that an appeal to revoke that decision lodged on  November  was also rejected. The complainant states that the judges who handed down the ruling are members of the provincial College of Judges, that is, the civil association favoured by the Attorney Generals Office of the Supreme Court of Justice in the Province of Buenos Aires, to the detriment of the APPJ. According to the complainant, this explains why the ruling omitted any reference to the discriminatory treatment suffered by the APPJ.
.The complainant also notes that, on  September , they lodged an appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights), with regard to the persecution of the Secretary-General of the APPJ, and in particular for the illegal administrative proceedings and the refusal of trade union leave. The complainant notes that this appeal is still ongoing.
.In its communications dated  May  and  July , the Government states that, in accordance with the report sent by the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations, the APPJ is a minor trade union, with a total of  members and has only become active recently (its simple trade union status was granted in ). The Government states that, although its numerical circumstances do not lessen its right to representation, the Trade Union Associations Act No. . grants trade union status, which includes the ability to collectively bargain on behalf of the sector, to the most representative trade union. In this case, the most representative trade union, with trade union status and which participates in collective bargaining, is the Judicial Association of Buenos Aires.
.With regard to the administrative proceedings against the Secretary-General of the APPJ, the Government states that no part of the resolution of the Provinces Attorney General shows any act of persecution for his role as a trade union leader and that attention was drawn to his behaviour as a result of a failure to carry out his duties as a public servant, after all the planned legal remedies for his defence had been exhausted.
.The Government also reports that Labour Tribunal No.  in the San Martn Judicial Department, Province of Buenos Aires, handed down a final ruling rejecting the complaint of unfair practices presented by the APPJ in its entirety, considering that there was no evidence of any intention discredit, disturb or obstruct the activities of the APPJ in the positions attributed to the judiciary. According to the Government, that ruling has been accepted by the claimant and is final.
.The Committee observes that, in this complaint, the complainant alleges acts of anti-union discrimination by the Attorney Generals Office of the Supreme Court of Justice in the Province of Buenos Aires against the Secretary-General of the APPJ (by bringing administrative proceedings against him for matters unconnected with his work and by not granting him trade union leave) as well as against the APPJ (with which they do not hold dialogue and which they do not allow to participate in collective bargaining).
.With regard to the Secretary-General of the APPJ, the Committee notes the complainants allegation that: (i) as a result of his request, in November  and on behalf of the APPJ, for the authorization of one rest day per week during two-week shifts, administrative proceedings were brought against him for matters unconnected with his work, with the aim of removing him from his job and his trade union leadership role; (ii) by taking disciplinary measures against the Secretary-General, the Attorney Generals Office of the Supreme Court of Justice is taking de facto measures against and interfering with the whole of the APPJ; and (iii) by arguing that the APPJ does not have trade union status, it has been denied trade union leave. With regard to the APPJ, it is alleged that: (i) it is not permitted to participate in bargaining because it does not have trade union status, and (ii) while the Attorney Generals Office refuses to meet with the APPJ and does not have any dialogue with it at all, it does hold dialogue and meet with the College of Judges and Clerks in the Province of Buenos Aires, which is a non-profit civil association.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government states that the APPJ is a trade union with  members that has only become active recently, and that although its numerical circumstances do not lessen its right to representation, another trade union, which is the most representative union and has trade union status (the Judicial Association of Buenos Aires) has the authority to bargain collectively. The Government also states that the administrative proceedings were a result of a failure to carry out his duties as a public servant and had no relationship whatsoever with his role as a trade union leader.
.The Committee notes that, according to both the complainant and the Government, a legal complaint for unfair practices made by the APPJ was rejected in its entirety. The Committee notes that, in its ruling, handed down on  October , the court found that there",-1,2017,Argentina
17,"was no evidence of any intention discredit, disturb or obstruct the activities of the APPJ in the positions attributed to the judiciary. The Committee also observes that, according to the complainant: (i) an appeal to revoke that ruling lodged by the APPJ was rejected (because the ruling was not revocable); and (ii) the appeal to revoke the ruling was based on the fact that the ruling had omitted any reference to the discriminatory treatment suffered by the APPJ (according to the APPJ, the judges did not make any reference to the favourable treatment that the Attorney Generals Office gave to the College of Judges, because the judges are members of that organization).
.The Committee observes that the matter relating to the refusal to grant the Secretary General of the APPJ trade union leave because the APPJ does not have trade union status, was not raised by the APPJ in its legal complaint, which has a firm and definitive judgment, but rather in an appeal for amparo presented in , according to the complainant. Not having any more information about that appeal, the Committee trusts that in this case the right of workers to enjoy adequate protection against anti-union discrimination has been protected.
.Recalling that minority trade unions that have been denied the right to negotiate collectively should be permitted to perform their activities and at least to speak on behalf of their members and represent them in the case of an individual claim [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para.], the Committee encourages the Government to take the necessary measures to promote dialogue between the parties with a view to ensuring the right of the APPJ to make representations on behalf of its members and to represent them in cases of individual grievances.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee encourages the Government to take the necessary measures to promote dialogue between the parties with a view to ensuring the right of the APPJ to make representations on behalf of its members and to represent them in cases of individual grievances.",2,2017,Argentina
18,".The complaints are contained in communications from the Argentine Teachers?Federation (UDA), dated  November  and  May and  October  (Case No. ); in communications from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC), representing one of its members, the Argentine Union of Private Tutors (SADOP), dated  February and  April  (Case No. ); and in communications from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA), dated  April and May  and  February  (Case No. ).
.The Government sent its replies in communications dated April  and February and March .
.In view of the fact that the complaints address identical issues, Cases Nos ,  and  will be the subject of a single examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication of  November , the UDA denounces the restriction on collective bargaining for the public teaching sector by the Government, in so far as, unlike the practice followed in previous years and despite insistent complaints by the UDA, it failed to reconvene collective bargaining with a view to revisiting the issue of salaries, despite the fact that teachers?salaries have been strongly affected by rising inflation and the adverse socio-economic context of . It also indicates that a number of points in the collective agreement concluded in February  have not been implemented. The complainant considers that by acting in this way the Government is limiting the percentage increase in teachers?salaries and is obstructing the collective bargaining process, in violation of ILO Convention No. .
.In an additional communication of  May , the UDA declares that the initial complaint now has the support of the Federation of Education Workers (FETE) and of the secretariat for education policies, a subordinate body of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). The UDA indicates that, together with its members, it organized and carried out industrial action from March  in the search for a reformulation of salaries, among other labour claims, since the Government refused to reopen collective bargaining, namely to convene the federal joint negotiation board, and so the fixing of salaries remained in the hands of the State, against a background of  per cent year-on-year inflation. The industrial action, which was lawful and had been notified to the labour authority, received voluntary mass support from teachers in Argentina, who withdrew from their duties. The complainant alleges that, in addition to the failure to convene the joint negotiation board, the State decided to reduce the share of the Compensation Fund (financed by the Government) received by the seven provinces facing the greatest difficulties. According to official announcements, the intention of the Ministry of Education is to reduce that share by  per cent per year, until it disappears altogether in . As regards the Education Incentive Fund (FONID), the UDA states that even though it had been instituted for salary emergencies? it has become a normal and usual complement to teachers?salaries, albeit with the downside that it is not classified as remuneration and hence does not generate social security contributions.
.Considering the salary situation in the Province of Buenos Aires to be unsustainable, the complainant indicates that it filed an action for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) at the end of March . As a protective measure, it requested the convening of the negotiation board provided for under section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ), with implementing regulations laid down by Decree No. /. By a decision of  April , the protective measure was granted in summary proceedings and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was ordered to convene within five days the negotiation board provided for by section  of Act No. . The State appealed against this decision in the National Chamber for Labour Appeals. The proceedings are in progress and no first-instance ruling had been issued by the end of May .
.The UDA adds that on  March  the Government summoned the trade unions to a joint meeting during which it made a proposal consisting of the advance payment of one-off fixed sums not classified as remuneration (considered illegal and not generating contributions to the social security system) for serving employees, the payment being subject to non-implementation of the industrial action called for by the trade unions at the national level for  and  March . As the proposal was rejected, the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires did not put forward any other proposal but served notice of compulsory conciliation on the trade unions. The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on  March  secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On  March , the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.
.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.). In particular, it reports that an application was filed by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. ///).
.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on , volunteers to give educational support to the almost  million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March , at the start of the  academic year.
.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of  March  to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective. It alleges that the recourse to compulsory conciliation constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires and also of Acts Nos  and . The UDA also reiterates that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires initiated the procedure calling for the suspension of its trade union status.
.In its communication dated  February , FLATEC reports that the classroom allowance ?which is an additional component to the salary structure of private tutors based on Act No.  and Decree No.  of the Province of Mendoza ?has actually been established to obstruct the regular exercise of the right to strike of private tutors, through the imposition of fines and the withholding of salary. They state that the monetary allocation constitutes remuneration, and so it entails contributions in the areas of welfare, assistance and union dues, and is to be considered in the calculation of additional annual earnings. The classroom allowance is to be paid from March  for every employee covered by Act No. and its amendments who provides services in the Directorate-General for Schools, has the status of qualified teacher and performs assigned duties on all working days in the respective month, except for absences due to sick leave or accidents or any other leave on objective grounds defined by the abovementioned legislation.
.The complainant objects to the fact that for just one day of strike action in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay. Hence the right to strike is penalized through an excessive loss of pay, which is far greater than the amount that corresponds to the strike day.
.FLATEC also denounces the arbitrary and unlawful failure to implement the collective bargaining procedure of the federal joint negotiation board for education, and describes the historical background to the current dispute. It recalls that, in order to cut costs in educational matters and as part of commitments for the renegotiation of foreign debt, in January  the Executive Authority proposed, and Congress adopted, Act No.  concerning the transfer of education services to the provinces. This transfer resulted in a serious imbalance in the quality of",5,2017,Argentina
19,"education and salary levels between the provinces with fewer financial resources and other provinces. The complainant indicates that in  the Education Finance Act (No. ), among other legal instruments, sought to iron out inequalities and took grievances from the teaching community into consideration. The instruments established by the National Congress included the federal joint negotiation board for education, a national and federal forum in which, with the involvement of the national teachers?unions, including SADOP, conditions of work were regulated and minimum pay for all teachers in the country was agreed on an annual basis, prior to the start of the academic year. In accordance with the Education Finance Act (No. ) and Decree No. /, the federal joint negotiation board for education was formally established through administrative file No.../ in the register of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, where the records establishing the federal joint negotiation board were signed by the State, currently the Ministry of Education and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and the Federal Council for Culture and Education, representing the education ministries of the provinces and the national trade union organizations.
.The complainant emphasizes that, from  to , regular ongoing joint negotiations were held on an annual basis. It maintains that this practice has given rise to a sectoral and administrative custom which produces effects and legal obligations, and so neither the federal Government nor the provincial governments can restrict the federal joint negotiation board. Hence, for the complainant, the decision of the federal Government and initially of a number of provincial governments to nullify the salary negotiations established in the federal joint negotiation board is not an administrative omission whereby nothing was decided despite the request of the national unions; rather, it shows the Governments wish to avoid complying with the Education Finance Act (No. ), as though this Act was not in force. The complainant also claims that this is a violation of Act No. , section  of which provides that teachers throughout the education system shall have rights and obligations, including with regard to a decent salary and collective bargaining at the national and regional levels, and shall also be covered by the obligations arising from ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The complainant considers particularly relevant the protective measure issued by the ruling of the National Labour Court, issued on  April , which ordered that the federal joint negotiation board for education be constituted; however, the political and ministerial authorities announced publicly on  April  that they would appeal against this ruling.
.The complainant also denounces the restrictions of the right to strike of teachers represented by SADOP, imposed by internal regulations of the Province of Buenos Aires, in so far as the latter, by a decision of  March , provided for a one-off exceptional payment of ,Argentine pesos (ARS) not classified as pensionable remuneration for teachers who taught classes on the days of industrial action announced from  March  onwards.
.In its first communication dated  April , CTERA indicates that the Education Sector Collective Bargaining Act of the Province of Buenos Aires has been in force for over ten years and collective negotiations were always resolved in a context of dialogue and in the framework of the law. However, it claims that the situation in the country has changed. From mid-February  the general secretary of the Single Union of Education Workers (SUTEBA), Mr Roberto Baradel, started to receive death threats aimed at himself and his family. The threats, received by email, made specific reference to his role in collective bargaining in the sector that he represents. CTERA adds that these serious threats are the subject of a complaint before Federal Court No.  of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. CTERA denounces the lack of protection and solidarity from the Government.
.The complainant denounces the use of compulsory conciliation (a mechanism whereby the labour administrative authority summons the parties to the dispute to a forum for dialogue) as a tool for restricting the right to strike of education workers in the Province of Buenos Aires, since the union representatives were summoned on  March  to the third meeting of the joint negotiation board for education (Act No. ), at which the Government made a salary proposal similar to the one which had already been rejected. It claims that in such circumstances and within the collective negotiations themselves, the labour minister of the province notified the union representatives of the order for compulsory conciliation (decision No. / of the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires). For CTERA, it is incomprehensible that a mechanism for bringing parties to dialogue should be used when they are already at the negotiating table. It claims that the use of compulsory conciliation by the employer can only be construed as a ploy to restrict the right to strike. This being the case, the trade unions had recourse to the local court to guarantee their rights and they secured a ruling in their favour on  March . CTERA alleges that the government of the Province of Buenos Aires, far from complying with the legal order, sought the participation of another legal entity with a view to overturning the initial court decision. According to the complainant, the matter is before the Provincial Supreme Court. In these circumstances, the trade unions lodged another appeal with the local court and secured another favourable ruling from another provincial magistrate (decision No. / (R.A.) CCALP).
.Lastly, CTERA denounces the joint decision of the Directorate-General of Culture (No. ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs (No. ) of  March , ordering ?in violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and  and of the National Constitution ?the payment of ARS, to teachers who, from  March  onwards, taught classes on days of industrial action.
.In a second communication dated  April , the complainant denounces the refusal of the National Executive to guarantee to education workers the right to collective bargaining. It indicates that collective negotiation at national level in Argentina was initiated within the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security through file No.../ under section  of Act No.  and implementing Decree No./. It also recalls that section  of the Decree prescribes that the provisions of the Decree shall be interpreted in conformity with ILO Convention No.  and that section of the National Education Act (No. ) of December  recognizes the right of all teachers to engage in collective bargaining at the national and regional levels. The complainant indicates that in the  round of negotiations with the current national Government, a collective agreement was reached for a salary increase in February of that year, within the said bargaining entity.
.Despite the clarity of the legislation, since  the State as employer has systematically refused to empower the collective bargaining body, on the grounds that the third clause of the joint agreement of  established an automatic increase of  per cent of the initial teaching salary above the minimum living wage which is to be fixed in accordance with Act No. . According to the complainant, this interpretation of the collective agreement of  is unsustainable, not only because of the clarity of the abovementioned Act, which stipulates compulsory negotiation for the future, but also because the aforementioned minimum figure of  per cent clearly constitutes a threshold resulting from the imbalances which arose in previous years in first negotiating the teaching salary and then the minimum living wage, the former having remained lower than the latter, a situation that the clause in question sought to avoid. For the complainant, that clause could never be used as a pretext for not engaging in collective bargaining. The mere fact of adopting a clause to keep the minimum teaching salary in proportion to the minimum living wage cannot mean that the teachers?unions ?including CTERA, which represents  per cent of education workers ?shall stop the regular exercise of their right to fix salaries and conditions of work.
.In its communication of  February , the complainant denounces the recent adoption by the national Government of Decree No. /, involving the de facto abolition of the national system of collective negotiation in force for education workers. It claims that this is clearly part of a general elimination of the rights of workers in both the public and private sectors in the country, with clear instances of persecution by the Government and some of the provincial administrations.
.For CTERA, Decree No. /, in an unconstitutional manner and violating ILO Conventions Nos ,  and , seeks to amend Act No.  and prevent the fixing of the national minimum salary for the education sector within the federal joint negotiation board. It also objects to the fact that: (i) there is no possibility of discussing or agreeing on the minimum teaching salary as provided for in Act No. ; (ii) the expression of the wishes of the trade unions is not respected by the employer",-1,2017,Argentina
20,"in that the key element of representativeness is disregarded; (iii) there is no right to information on collective bargaining matters since a close examination of the Decree shows that it abolishes the right to information within the joint negotiation board for education itself (section ), thereby denying the unions knowledge of employment levels in the education sector, investment policies, programmes for the introduction of new technologies, etc.; and (iv) there is also no possibility of requesting the Ministry of Labour to set up a board for collective agreement negotiations since section  of Decree No. / has been abolished.
.Lastly, CTERA denounces the brutal crackdown by the police in the city of Buenos Aires on  April  against education workers and union officials belonging to CTERA, some of whom were unlawfully arrested and subsequently released, for attempting to set up the Mobile School?at the Plaza de los Dos Congresos with a view to calling on the Government, in ways other than work stoppages, to convene a national joint negotiation board in the sector. It also claims that the head of State, when referring to the teachers?salary claims, made offensive comments about the education unions.
.In a communication dated  April , the Government states that at no time was there non-compliance on its part which would justify the complaint presented by the UDA. On the contrary, considerable progress had occurred in relation to the previous situation.
.Firstly, the Government makes a clarification regarding the reference to the national Government (to which the Ministry of Education and Sport belongs) as the employer? For the Government, this assertion is far removed from reality. In this regard, it explains that in the early s legislation adopted by the national Congress (Act No.  and complementary legislation) provided that educational establishments that had hitherto been under the auspices of the national Government would now be directly governed by the provinces. Hence the legislation provided at that time for the transfer to the provinces of educational establishments and their teaching and non-teaching staff that until then had been under national direction. Consequently, from that time onwards no educational establishments, or any of the teachers employed there, were any longer under the control of the national Government. Hence it is incorrect to describe the national Government as the employer? There are  different sets of regulations relating to teaching, each of them applicable in their respective area of jurisdiction. According to the Government, this demonstrates that the central government is not the employer? the employers are the provinces plus the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, each having its respective territory.
.As regards the framework agreement (provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ) and referred to in point  of the collective agreement of February ), the Government indicates that it should not be forgotten that even if reference is made to a framework agreement? what is essential is the existence of agreements between the parties in each province. On that basis, from a position already fixed internally, discussions on the framework agreement can begin with the aim of reaching basic agreements at national level. The Government indicates that section  of Act No.  of January  (implemented by Decree No. /), provides as follows: The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (currently the Ministry of Education and Sport) together with the Federal Council for Culture and Education (currently the Federal Council for Education) and the teaching unions with national representation, shall conclude a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d) the teaching career. The Government explains that: (i) although no meetings were held from  to  for the purposes of formulating the framework agreement established in section of Act No.  ?there were only meetings at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary, which had been fixed by agreement with the unions in some cases, while other meetings had been prescribed by decree of the Executive Authority where there was no agreement ?this inaction ceased as from ; (ii) the foregoing does not alter the fact that it is a complicated, difficult task for the various regional jurisdictions, each having its own regulations relating to teachers, to reach basic agreements in relation to the creation of the framework agreement; and (iii) this whole situation goes far beyond the possibilities of the national Government, which depends on the decisions and policies of the various regional jurisdictions within the countrys federal system.
.With regard to the minimum teaching salary (point  of the collective agreement of February ), namely the salary threshold below which no province may set the salary of any teacher, the Government explains that reaching agreement at that time on an automatic mechanism for increasing the minimum teaching salary was a significant step forward. The new mechanism agreed upon with the trade unions entails the automatic increase of the minimum salary, which is updated each year. This joint agreement establishes that the teaching salary must be at least  per cent higher than the minimum living wage, and this adjustment would be automatic, irrespective of any agreement reached in the joint negotiation board for education. For the Government, the clause regarding the automatic increase makes it unnecessary and merely academic to hold discussions on the minimum teaching salary each year. The automatic increase is calculated on the basis of the minimum living wage. This is fixed annually by the Council for the Minimum Living Wage, with the participation of workers, employers and representatives of the national Government and of the Federal Labour Council (provincial governments). Hence, in addition to the amount established annually as the general minimum wage by this Council, there is an extra  per cent as a fixed component of the minimum teaching salary for the year.
.With regard to the Compensation Fund referred to in the complaint from the UDA, this is designed to complement (compensate) the earnings of teachers who do not reach the established minimum threshold. The aim is to help iron out disparities in the initial teaching salary in provinces where, despite financial input into the sector and greater efficiency in the allocation of resources, it is not possible to overcome those inequalities. This is separate from the FONID, which, simply providing incentives as its name suggests, has a totally different function from the Compensation Fund.
.In a communication of March , the Government forwards information provided by the Ministry of Governance, Labour and Justice of the Province of Mendoza regarding the classroom allowance. It states that FLATEC brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court. However, it was withdrawn by the plaintiff. According to the Government, this demonstrates a lack of coherence in that the union renounced any local ruling but decided to pursue the matter at the international level in the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association. It also indicates that: (i) the Province of Mendoza is experiencing a severe financial emergency; (ii) in conformity with the terms of the national joint negotiations signed by the national union representatives on  February , the initial teaching salary was raised by implementing the Compensation Fund, with a further increase in the funds supplied by FONID, and stipulating that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the minimum living wage, irrespective of any agreements reached in the joint negotiation board for education; (iii) the negotiations took place in accordance with all the principles of good faith negotiation. For each proposal made, appropriate efforts were made to reach agreements, within the current economic context and budget of the province; (iv) however, even though the province improved the initial proposal on several occasions, no agreement could be reached. It was here that the increase in the teaching salary was fixed by decree, chiefly safeguarding the right to education and thereby guaranteeing the resumption of classes; and (v) with regard to the classroom allowance, the provincial government considers that the whole complaint is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity. On the contrary, the Government explains that this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism, there has been a substantial improvement in pupil attendance and also a reduction in the number of replacement teachers required. The Government also denies categorically that the classroom allowance is a way for the legislation or Government to penalize the right to strike through substantial losses of teaching salary for just one stoppage or strike day.
.Lastly, the Government attaches a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza, Second Chamber, in the case Single Union of Education Workers v. Government of Mendoza ?claim of unconstitutionality? dated  December , which calls on the Plenary Court to rule on the constitutionality of the legal provisions challenged in the case file (Decree No. / ratified by Act No.",-1,2017,Argentina
21," concerning the classroom allowance).
.In its communication of February , which also refers to Cases Nos  and  since they involve similar facts, the Government considers that in all the scenarios under examination agreement had been reached, or was about to be reached, and so the complaints should be disregarded.
.With regard to the threats to the SUTEBA union official, Mr Roberto Baradel, the Government indicates that they are the subject of judicial proceedings before Federal Court No.  and the corresponding criminal investigation proceedings provided for by law have been instituted.
.As regards the statements of the national President, the Government considers that they are part and parcel of democratic debate, and that in any case there have been no judicial complaints in this regard. It is also surprised that the issue has been brought before a supranational body without any recourse to the competent national bodies.
.With regard to the issue of national collective bargaining in education, the Government indicates that the joint agreement of  February  had been signed by the general secretaries of CTERA, the UDA and SADOP. The agreement establishes that, irrespective of what the unions negotiate with the provinces, a minimum salary of ARS, from February and ARS, from July will be guaranteed through the implementation of the Compensation Fund (Education Finance Act No. ) for all the modalities and jurisdictions of the country. There is also an increase in the funds contributed by FONID, which brings the national minimum salary to ARS, from February and to ARS, from July. The agreement also stipulates that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the national living wage (clause  of the agreement).
.The Government reiterates that the payment of teaching salaries is a matter for each of the  provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The fact that national funds have gone to compensate teaching salaries in provinces where they are below the minimum living wage does not mean that the national Government is the employer. The Government reiterates that if the clause regarding automatic adjustment is interpreted correctly, any discussion each year on salaries at national level in relation to teachers?minimum earnings is needless and/or purely academic.
.With regard to the framework agreement, the Government indicates that the parties undertake to establish within  days a working group for the drafting of a framework agreement (collective labour agreement), in accordance with section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ). This lays the foundations of a framework agreement, or the foundations of a new national joint negotiation board for education, which, unlike those adopted in previous years, takes account of the different situations in all the regional jurisdictions of the State, with the sole aim of avoiding the inequalities produced by the previous system, which the national Government had to resolve by contributing more funds to the provinces for the payment of teaching salaries. It points out that the aforementioned section provides for the setting up of a working group to draft a framework agreement, making it clear that collective agreements will be a matter for the provincial jurisdictions. Hence it has been possible to create an automated mechanism for the minimum salary, something that was provided for by law more than ten years ago but which has never been done in practice. It adds that the amparo action Argentine Teachers?Federation v. Ministry of Education and Sport et al.?(Case No. /) produced a ruling which rejected the claim brought by the union (Labour Court No. ).
.With regard to the allegations concerning the Province of Buenos Aires and the recourse to compulsory conciliation, the Government considers that the principal circumstance which gave rise to the order for conciliation was the need to keep schools open because many of them also operate as canteens. However, the dispute has been settled with the adoption of Act No. / of  June  (Agreement with all teachers and their professional organizations involved in the salary dispute in the Province of Buenos Aires?. Specifically, it is stated that the implementing authority has formally approved by an absolute majority the salary proposal for  presented by the provincial government in the joint negotiation document, in accordance with the terms of Act No. .
.With regard to the ARS, bonus, established by the internal regulations of the Province of Buenos Aires, for teachers who taught classes on the days of industrial action since March , the Government indicates that this action was taken with an eye to the resumption of classes, with the aim of giving objective recognition to those who performed their tasks in a clearly extraordinary context, since the strikes were carried out with the pupils inside the classrooms.
.With regard to the allegations of a brutal crackdown by the police of Buenos Aires on account of the setting up of a mobile school, the Government has supplied the report of February  drawn up by the Secretary for Security of the Ministry of Security and Justice of the city of Buenos Aires, which states that the unions did not comply with the regulations governing the occupation of public spaces and that the police acted in line with the provisions of the Comprehensive Public Security System Act (No. ), in particular as regards the proportional use of force.
.The Committee observes that Cases Nos ,  and  are concerned with similar allegations, namely: (i) the refusal of the national Government to resume collective bargaining with the public education sector (issue of the federal joint negotiation board for education); (ii) the unlawful use of compulsory conciliation in the Province of Buenos Aires; (iii) obstruction of the right to strike of teachers in the private sector in the Province of Mendoza through the loss of a salary component (classroom allowance); (iv) threats against a trade union official; and (v) violations of freedom of association in the Province of Buenos Aires (request for the suspension of official trade union status; restriction of the right to strike; and police crackdown).
.The Committee observes that a key element common to the complaints is the complainants?allegation that the public authorities refused to convene the resumption of collective bargaining for addressing the issue of salaries for teachers in the public sector, thereby putting an end to the mechanism of the federal joint negotiation board for education, which had existed since , as regulated by the Education Finance Act (No. ) and Decree No. /. The Committee notes that, according to the information supplied by the complainants, the purpose of the negotiation mechanism, with the involvement of the national teaching unions, was to remove disparities in salaries arising from the transfer of education services to the provinces. The Committee observes that the complainants concur that the Government unilaterally put an end to the social dialogue mechanism provided for in the Education Finance Act and hence failed to meet the obligations arising from ILO Conventions Nos  and . The Committee also notes the indication of CTERA in its additional communication of February  that the national Government adopted Decree No. / entailing the de facto abolition of the collective bargaining system at the national level in the education sector.
.The Committee notes the Governments statement that the central government is not the employer of the teachers and that salary issues are a matter for discussion by the provincial governments. It notes in particular that the Government considers that in view of the tripartite agreement of February  in which a minimum teaching salary was fixed with an automatic adjustment, there is no need for periodic discussions at federal level. The Committee also notes the Governments indications that progress has been made regarding the framework agreement provided for in section  of Act No. , making it clear that collective agreements shall come within the competence of the provincial authorities. The Committee notes the Governments indication that no meeting has been held so far for formulating the framework agreement, that the only meetings held had been at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary and that, while acknowledging the difficulty of the task, steps are being taken to establish the framework agreement.
.The Committee observes that section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ) provides that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in conjunction with the Federal Council for Culture and Education and the teaching unions with national representation shall adopt a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d)the teaching career, but that so far the appropriate conditions had not existed for establishing the framework agreement. The Committee understands, from the information provided by the parties, that the federal joint negotiation board for education was designed to be a forum for dialogue on issues relating to work in the education sector, including salary issues.
.The Committee observes that in the collective agreement of February  concluded within the federal joint negotiation board an automatic mechanism was agreed upon",-1,2017,Argentina
22,"for increasing the minimum teaching salary: the new mechanism agreed upon with the trade unions involves the automatic increase of the minimum salary each year, with the result that, on the basis of the joint negotiations, the teaching salary must be at least  per cent higher than the minimum living wage, and this adjustment would be automatic, irrespective of any agreement reached in the joint negotiation board. In this respect, the Committee notes the different viewpoints of the complainants and the Government. On the one hand, the unions claim that the mere fact of adopting a clause to keep the minimum teaching salary higher than the minimum living wage by a specified proportion ( per cent) cannot mean that the teaching unions shall stop exercising their right to bargain collectively with regard to salaries and conditions of work. On the other hand, the Government considers that because of the clause regarding the automatic increase, there is no need to reopen discussions each year regarding the minimum teaching salary. The Committee also observes that the Governments position is consolidated with the adoption of Decree No. / amending certain sections, and abolishing others, of Decree No. /. The Committee observes that with these amendments the discussions no longer focus on salary issues, since the only requirement is the link between the minimum teaching salary and the minimum living wage.
.The Committee wishes to recall that on several occasions it has drawn attention to the importance of promoting collective bargaining, as set out in Article  of Convention No. , in the education sector [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. While considering that it is not competent to express views on the level ?federal or provincial ?of collective bargaining, and noting the efforts made regarding the implementation of a framework agreement, the Committee also wishes to underline the special importance of salary matters in collective bargaining. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed on salary matters as part of the exercise of collective bargaining, in order to determine the scope of the clause for the automatic adjustment of the minimum teaching salary that the parties to the February  federal joint negotiations agreed on and to ensure that collective bargaining on salary remains possible at all levels.
.The Committee notes that although both the complainants and the Government have mentioned various amparo appeals, no definitive decisions have yet been adopted on the issue of the federal joint negotiation board. The Committee requests the Government to forward the relevant judicial decisions, once they have been issued.
.As regards the abovementioned Decree No. /, which, according to CTERA, entails the de facto abolition of the collective bargaining system at the national level in the education sector, the Committee notes that so far the Government has not supplied any information on the Decree. With regard to the allegation by CTERA that the new Decree disregards the key element of representativeness, the Committee is bound to note in this regard that section  of the Decree substantially alters the previous situation. It provides that the representation in the framework agreement of public sector education workers, in the provinces and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, shall be exercised by one member of each first-, second- and third-level organization having official trade union status and having nationwide geographical scope for teaching, and that if in the course of the negotiations there is no uniformity within the representation of the teachers?unions, that of the majority members shall prevail.
.The Committee also observes that the reference to a list of information which must be in the possession of the parties, and considered to be the minimum necessary for undertaking the required discussions within the framework agreement, has been removed from section  of new Decree No. /. In this regard, the Committee recalls that Article  of the Collective Bargaining Recommendation,  (No. ), which complements Convention No.  ratified by Argentina, provides that measures adapted to national conditions should be taken, if necessary, so that the parties have access to the information required for meaningful negotiations. Hence, while observing the efforts made by the Government to undertake reforms in the education sector, the Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners to determine the appropriate representation of workers in the process of establishing the framework agreement provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ). It also requests the Government to ensure that the parties have the necessary information during the actual negotiations. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on this matter.
.With regard to compulsory conciliation instigated by the Minister of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires, the Committee notes that CTERA denounces the use of compulsory conciliation (consisting of a mechanism in which the labour administrative authority summons the parties to the dispute to a forum for dialogue) as a tool for restricting the right to strike of education workers in the Province of Buenos Aires, since no industrial action may be taken during the period of compulsory conciliation. The Committee notes the indication by CTERA that the trade unions secured protective measures in their favour and that (as at April ) the matter was before the Provincial Supreme Court. The Committee notes the Governments indication that the main factor behind the summons to conciliation was the need to keep schools open since many of them also function as canteens. It also notes the Governments statement that the dispute was settled with the agreement of all teachers and professional organizations involved in the salary dispute in the Province of Buenos Aires (Act No. / dated  June ).
.The Committee recalls that the provision of food to pupils of school age may be considered to be an essential service [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. It also recalls that it has examined several cases from Argentina involving objections to orders for compulsory conciliation between the parties to a dispute in the public education sector by the administrative authority, when the latter was a party in the dispute and that it has considered that it was necessary to entrust the decision of initiating the conciliation procedure in collective disputes to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute (see thReport, Case No. , paragraph ).
.As regards the classroom allowance, which forms part of the salary structure for private tutors, as established by law in the Province of Mendoza, the Committee notes the complainants objection that this salary element has been established for the purpose of obstructing the regular exercise of the right to strike by private tutors. The Committee notes the complainants allegation that if there is just one strike day in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay, and so the right to strike is penalized by an excessive loss of remuneration. The Committee notes the Governments reply indicating that the plaintiff brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court, though this was later withdrawn. The Committee also notes the Governments indication that: (i) the present denunciation is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity; and (ii)on the contrary, this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism.
.The Committee observes that the classroom allowance mechanism does not in itself raise any issue relating to freedom of association. Nevertheless, it considers that it may have indirect repercussions with regard to salary deductions for strike days, where it involves a substantial loss of teaching salary for just a one-day stoppage or strike. On several occasions the Committee has considered that salary deductions for days of strike should only apply to workers who have taken part in the strike or a protest action and that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles [see Compilation, op. cit., paras & ]. However, in a case where the pay deductions were higher than the amount corresponding to the period of the strike, the Committee recalled that the imposition of sanctions for strike action was not conducive to harmonious labour relations [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. In the present case, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the classroom allowance mechanism operating in the Province of Mendoza does not give rise to excessive salary deductions for legitimate strike action. In view of the information provided by the Government, the Committee requests the complainant to indicate the reasons for withdrawing its claim of unconstitutionality concerning the classroom allowance.
.With regard to the allegations by CTERA that the general secretary of SUTEBA, Mr Roberto Baradel, has become the target of death threats, directed at himself and his family, in relation to his role in collective bargaining in the sector which",-1,2017,Argentina
23,"he represents, the Committee notes that these serious threats are the subject of a complaint before Federal Court No.  of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Reiterating that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see Compilation, op.cit., para. ], the Committee urges the Government to provide information as soon as possible on the steps taken to assess the need to provide protection for Mr Roberto Baradel, and on any corresponding measure.
.As regards the proceedings requesting the suspension of the official union status of the UDA, the Committee notes that the latter, in its communication of  October , reiterates that those proceedings were instituted by the Ministry of Labour of the province. In view of the lack of response in this regard the Committee requests the Government to provide information on the trade union status of the UDA.
.With regard to the measures agreed upon by the Ministry of Education ?Province of Buenos Aires ?to recompense workers who did not take part in the strike of  March  with an exceptional payment of ARS,, the Committee notes the Governments indication that this action was taken with an eye to the resumption of classes, with the aim of giving objective recognition to those who performed their tasks in a clearly extraordinary context, since the strikes were carried out with the pupils inside the classrooms. The Committee recalls that on various occasions, concerning measures applied to compensate workers who do not participate in a strike by bonuses, it considered that such discriminatory practices constitute a major obstacle to the right of trade unionists to organize their activities [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. With regard to the allegation by the UDA that in March  the governor of the province called on , volunteers to give educational support to the almost  million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the strike called by the teaching unions at the start of the  academic year, the Committee has indicated, for example, that minimum services may be established in the education sector, in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strikes of long duration [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. While noting the Governments indication that it acted with an eye to the resumption of classes, the Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that the right of trade unions to organize their activities is not obstructed, and that any minimum service is subject to discussions with the trade unions concerned.
.With regard to the allegations of CTERA denouncing a brutal crackdown by the police in the city of Buenos Aires on  April  against workers and officials belonging to the aforementioned union, and also the illegal detention of some of them, for attempting to set up the Mobile School?at the Plaza de los Dos Congresos, the Committee, while noting the report of the Secretary for Security at the Ministry of Security and Justice in Buenos Aires, wishes to recall that freedom of assembly and freedom of opinion and expression are a sine qua non for the exercise of freedom of association. It also recalls that measures depriving trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights, and that the police authorities should be given precise instructions so that, in cases where public order is not seriously threatened, people are not arrested simply for having organized or participated in a demonstration [see Compilation, op. cit., paras ,  and ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of collective bargaining on salary matters, in order to determine the scope of the agreement reached on the clause for the automatic adjustment of the minimum teaching salary in the February  federal joint negotiations and to ensure that collective bargaining on salary remains possible at all levels.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to forward the relevant judicial decisions concerning the federal joint negotiation board, once they have been issued.(c)	The Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners to determine the appropriate representation of workers in the process of establishing the framework agreement provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ). It also requests the Government to ensure that the parties have the necessary information during the actual negotiations. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on this matter.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the classroom allowance mechanism operating in the Province of Mendoza does not give rise to excessive salary deductions for legitimate strike action, and to send the text of any judicial decision in this respect. The Committee also asks the complainant to indicate the reason for withdrawing its claim of unconstitutionality regarding the classroom allowance.(e)	The Committee urges the Government to provide information as soon as possible on the steps taken to assess the need to provide protection for the SUTEBA general secretary, Mr Roberto Baradel, and on any corresponding measure.(f)	The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the situation of the UDA with regard to the request for the suspension of its official union status made by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires.(g)	The Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that the right of trade unions to organize their activities is not obstructed, and that, in cases of strikes of long duration, any minimum service is subject to discussions with the trade unions concerned.",-1,2017,Argentina
24,".The complaints are contained in communications from the Argentine Teachers?Federation (UDA), dated  November  and  May and  October  (Case No. ); in communications from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC), representing one of its members, the Argentine Union of Private Tutors (SADOP), dated  February and  April  (Case No. ); and in communications from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA), dated  April and May  and  February  (Case No. ).
.The Government sent its replies in communications dated April  and February and March .
.In view of the fact that the complaints address identical issues, Cases Nos ,  and  will be the subject of a single examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication of  November , the UDA denounces the restriction on collective bargaining for the public teaching sector by the Government, in so far as, unlike the practice followed in previous years and despite insistent complaints by the UDA, it failed to reconvene collective bargaining with a view to revisiting the issue of salaries, despite the fact that teachers?salaries have been strongly affected by rising inflation and the adverse socio-economic context of . It also indicates that a number of points in the collective agreement concluded in February  have not been implemented. The complainant considers that by acting in this way the Government is limiting the percentage increase in teachers?salaries and is obstructing the collective bargaining process, in violation of ILO Convention No. .
.In an additional communication of  May , the UDA declares that the initial complaint now has the support of the Federation of Education Workers (FETE) and of the secretariat for education policies, a subordinate body of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). The UDA indicates that, together with its members, it organized and carried out industrial action from March  in the search for a reformulation of salaries, among other labour claims, since the Government refused to reopen collective bargaining, namely to convene the federal joint negotiation board, and so the fixing of salaries remained in the hands of the State, against a background of  per cent year-on-year inflation. The industrial action, which was lawful and had been notified to the labour authority, received voluntary mass support from teachers in Argentina, who withdrew from their duties. The complainant alleges that, in addition to the failure to convene the joint negotiation board, the State decided to reduce the share of the Compensation Fund (financed by the Government) received by the seven provinces facing the greatest difficulties. According to official announcements, the intention of the Ministry of Education is to reduce that share by  per cent per year, until it disappears altogether in . As regards the Education Incentive Fund (FONID), the UDA states that even though it had been instituted for salary emergencies? it has become a normal and usual complement to teachers?salaries, albeit with the downside that it is not classified as remuneration and hence does not generate social security contributions.
.Considering the salary situation in the Province of Buenos Aires to be unsustainable, the complainant indicates that it filed an action for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) at the end of March . As a protective measure, it requested the convening of the negotiation board provided for under section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ), with implementing regulations laid down by Decree No. /. By a decision of  April , the protective measure was granted in summary proceedings and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was ordered to convene within five days the negotiation board provided for by section  of Act No. . The State appealed against this decision in the National Chamber for Labour Appeals. The proceedings are in progress and no first-instance ruling had been issued by the end of May .
.The UDA adds that on  March  the Government summoned the trade unions to a joint meeting during which it made a proposal consisting of the advance payment of one-off fixed sums not classified as remuneration (considered illegal and not generating contributions to the social security system) for serving employees, the payment being subject to non-implementation of the industrial action called for by the trade unions at the national level for  and  March . As the proposal was rejected, the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires did not put forward any other proposal but served notice of compulsory conciliation on the trade unions. The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on  March  secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On  March , the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.
.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.). In particular, it reports that an application was filed by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. ///).
.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on , volunteers to give educational support to the almost  million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March , at the start of the  academic year.
.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of  March  to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective. It alleges that the recourse to compulsory conciliation constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires and also of Acts Nos  and . The UDA also reiterates that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires initiated the procedure calling for the suspension of its trade union status.
.In its communication dated  February , FLATEC reports that the classroom allowance ?which is an additional component to the salary structure of private tutors based on Act No.  and Decree No.  of the Province of Mendoza ?has actually been established to obstruct the regular exercise of the right to strike of private tutors, through the imposition of fines and the withholding of salary. They state that the monetary allocation constitutes remuneration, and so it entails contributions in the areas of welfare, assistance and union dues, and is to be considered in the calculation of additional annual earnings. The classroom allowance is to be paid from March  for every employee covered by Act No. and its amendments who provides services in the Directorate-General for Schools, has the status of qualified teacher and performs assigned duties on all working days in the respective month, except for absences due to sick leave or accidents or any other leave on objective grounds defined by the abovementioned legislation.
.The complainant objects to the fact that for just one day of strike action in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay. Hence the right to strike is penalized through an excessive loss of pay, which is far greater than the amount that corresponds to the strike day.
.FLATEC also denounces the arbitrary and unlawful failure to implement the collective bargaining procedure of the federal joint negotiation board for education, and describes the historical background to the current dispute. It recalls that, in order to cut costs in educational matters and as part of commitments for the renegotiation of foreign debt, in January  the Executive Authority proposed, and Congress adopted, Act No.  concerning the transfer of education services to the provinces. This transfer resulted in a serious imbalance in the quality of",5,2017,Argentina
25,"education and salary levels between the provinces with fewer financial resources and other provinces. The complainant indicates that in  the Education Finance Act (No. ), among other legal instruments, sought to iron out inequalities and took grievances from the teaching community into consideration. The instruments established by the National Congress included the federal joint negotiation board for education, a national and federal forum in which, with the involvement of the national teachers?unions, including SADOP, conditions of work were regulated and minimum pay for all teachers in the country was agreed on an annual basis, prior to the start of the academic year. In accordance with the Education Finance Act (No. ) and Decree No. /, the federal joint negotiation board for education was formally established through administrative file No.../ in the register of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, where the records establishing the federal joint negotiation board were signed by the State, currently the Ministry of Education and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and the Federal Council for Culture and Education, representing the education ministries of the provinces and the national trade union organizations.
.The complainant emphasizes that, from  to , regular ongoing joint negotiations were held on an annual basis. It maintains that this practice has given rise to a sectoral and administrative custom which produces effects and legal obligations, and so neither the federal Government nor the provincial governments can restrict the federal joint negotiation board. Hence, for the complainant, the decision of the federal Government and initially of a number of provincial governments to nullify the salary negotiations established in the federal joint negotiation board is not an administrative omission whereby nothing was decided despite the request of the national unions; rather, it shows the Governments wish to avoid complying with the Education Finance Act (No. ), as though this Act was not in force. The complainant also claims that this is a violation of Act No. , section  of which provides that teachers throughout the education system shall have rights and obligations, including with regard to a decent salary and collective bargaining at the national and regional levels, and shall also be covered by the obligations arising from ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The complainant considers particularly relevant the protective measure issued by the ruling of the National Labour Court, issued on  April , which ordered that the federal joint negotiation board for education be constituted; however, the political and ministerial authorities announced publicly on  April  that they would appeal against this ruling.
.The complainant also denounces the restrictions of the right to strike of teachers represented by SADOP, imposed by internal regulations of the Province of Buenos Aires, in so far as the latter, by a decision of  March , provided for a one-off exceptional payment of ,Argentine pesos (ARS) not classified as pensionable remuneration for teachers who taught classes on the days of industrial action announced from  March  onwards.
.In its first communication dated  April , CTERA indicates that the Education Sector Collective Bargaining Act of the Province of Buenos Aires has been in force for over ten years and collective negotiations were always resolved in a context of dialogue and in the framework of the law. However, it claims that the situation in the country has changed. From mid-February  the general secretary of the Single Union of Education Workers (SUTEBA), Mr Roberto Baradel, started to receive death threats aimed at himself and his family. The threats, received by email, made specific reference to his role in collective bargaining in the sector that he represents. CTERA adds that these serious threats are the subject of a complaint before Federal Court No.  of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. CTERA denounces the lack of protection and solidarity from the Government.
.The complainant denounces the use of compulsory conciliation (a mechanism whereby the labour administrative authority summons the parties to the dispute to a forum for dialogue) as a tool for restricting the right to strike of education workers in the Province of Buenos Aires, since the union representatives were summoned on  March  to the third meeting of the joint negotiation board for education (Act No. ), at which the Government made a salary proposal similar to the one which had already been rejected. It claims that in such circumstances and within the collective negotiations themselves, the labour minister of the province notified the union representatives of the order for compulsory conciliation (decision No. / of the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires). For CTERA, it is incomprehensible that a mechanism for bringing parties to dialogue should be used when they are already at the negotiating table. It claims that the use of compulsory conciliation by the employer can only be construed as a ploy to restrict the right to strike. This being the case, the trade unions had recourse to the local court to guarantee their rights and they secured a ruling in their favour on  March . CTERA alleges that the government of the Province of Buenos Aires, far from complying with the legal order, sought the participation of another legal entity with a view to overturning the initial court decision. According to the complainant, the matter is before the Provincial Supreme Court. In these circumstances, the trade unions lodged another appeal with the local court and secured another favourable ruling from another provincial magistrate (decision No. / (R.A.) CCALP).
.Lastly, CTERA denounces the joint decision of the Directorate-General of Culture (No. ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs (No. ) of  March , ordering ?in violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and  and of the National Constitution ?the payment of ARS, to teachers who, from  March  onwards, taught classes on days of industrial action.
.In a second communication dated  April , the complainant denounces the refusal of the National Executive to guarantee to education workers the right to collective bargaining. It indicates that collective negotiation at national level in Argentina was initiated within the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security through file No.../ under section  of Act No.  and implementing Decree No./. It also recalls that section  of the Decree prescribes that the provisions of the Decree shall be interpreted in conformity with ILO Convention No.  and that section of the National Education Act (No. ) of December  recognizes the right of all teachers to engage in collective bargaining at the national and regional levels. The complainant indicates that in the  round of negotiations with the current national Government, a collective agreement was reached for a salary increase in February of that year, within the said bargaining entity.
.Despite the clarity of the legislation, since  the State as employer has systematically refused to empower the collective bargaining body, on the grounds that the third clause of the joint agreement of  established an automatic increase of  per cent of the initial teaching salary above the minimum living wage which is to be fixed in accordance with Act No. . According to the complainant, this interpretation of the collective agreement of  is unsustainable, not only because of the clarity of the abovementioned Act, which stipulates compulsory negotiation for the future, but also because the aforementioned minimum figure of  per cent clearly constitutes a threshold resulting from the imbalances which arose in previous years in first negotiating the teaching salary and then the minimum living wage, the former having remained lower than the latter, a situation that the clause in question sought to avoid. For the complainant, that clause could never be used as a pretext for not engaging in collective bargaining. The mere fact of adopting a clause to keep the minimum teaching salary in proportion to the minimum living wage cannot mean that the teachers?unions ?including CTERA, which represents  per cent of education workers ?shall stop the regular exercise of their right to fix salaries and conditions of work.
.In its communication of  February , the complainant denounces the recent adoption by the national Government of Decree No. /, involving the de facto abolition of the national system of collective negotiation in force for education workers. It claims that this is clearly part of a general elimination of the rights of workers in both the public and private sectors in the country, with clear instances of persecution by the Government and some of the provincial administrations.
.For CTERA, Decree No. /, in an unconstitutional manner and violating ILO Conventions Nos ,  and , seeks to amend Act No.  and prevent the fixing of the national minimum salary for the education sector within the federal joint negotiation board. It also objects to the fact that: (i) there is no possibility of discussing or agreeing on the minimum teaching salary as provided for in Act No. ; (ii) the expression of the wishes of the trade unions is not respected by the employer",-1,2017,Argentina
26,"in that the key element of representativeness is disregarded; (iii) there is no right to information on collective bargaining matters since a close examination of the Decree shows that it abolishes the right to information within the joint negotiation board for education itself (section ), thereby denying the unions knowledge of employment levels in the education sector, investment policies, programmes for the introduction of new technologies, etc.; and (iv) there is also no possibility of requesting the Ministry of Labour to set up a board for collective agreement negotiations since section  of Decree No. / has been abolished.
.Lastly, CTERA denounces the brutal crackdown by the police in the city of Buenos Aires on  April  against education workers and union officials belonging to CTERA, some of whom were unlawfully arrested and subsequently released, for attempting to set up the Mobile School?at the Plaza de los Dos Congresos with a view to calling on the Government, in ways other than work stoppages, to convene a national joint negotiation board in the sector. It also claims that the head of State, when referring to the teachers?salary claims, made offensive comments about the education unions.
.In a communication dated  April , the Government states that at no time was there non-compliance on its part which would justify the complaint presented by the UDA. On the contrary, considerable progress had occurred in relation to the previous situation.
.Firstly, the Government makes a clarification regarding the reference to the national Government (to which the Ministry of Education and Sport belongs) as the employer? For the Government, this assertion is far removed from reality. In this regard, it explains that in the early s legislation adopted by the national Congress (Act No.  and complementary legislation) provided that educational establishments that had hitherto been under the auspices of the national Government would now be directly governed by the provinces. Hence the legislation provided at that time for the transfer to the provinces of educational establishments and their teaching and non-teaching staff that until then had been under national direction. Consequently, from that time onwards no educational establishments, or any of the teachers employed there, were any longer under the control of the national Government. Hence it is incorrect to describe the national Government as the employer? There are  different sets of regulations relating to teaching, each of them applicable in their respective area of jurisdiction. According to the Government, this demonstrates that the central government is not the employer? the employers are the provinces plus the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, each having its respective territory.
.As regards the framework agreement (provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ) and referred to in point  of the collective agreement of February ), the Government indicates that it should not be forgotten that even if reference is made to a framework agreement? what is essential is the existence of agreements between the parties in each province. On that basis, from a position already fixed internally, discussions on the framework agreement can begin with the aim of reaching basic agreements at national level. The Government indicates that section  of Act No.  of January  (implemented by Decree No. /), provides as follows: The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (currently the Ministry of Education and Sport) together with the Federal Council for Culture and Education (currently the Federal Council for Education) and the teaching unions with national representation, shall conclude a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d) the teaching career. The Government explains that: (i) although no meetings were held from  to  for the purposes of formulating the framework agreement established in section of Act No.  ?there were only meetings at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary, which had been fixed by agreement with the unions in some cases, while other meetings had been prescribed by decree of the Executive Authority where there was no agreement ?this inaction ceased as from ; (ii) the foregoing does not alter the fact that it is a complicated, difficult task for the various regional jurisdictions, each having its own regulations relating to teachers, to reach basic agreements in relation to the creation of the framework agreement; and (iii) this whole situation goes far beyond the possibilities of the national Government, which depends on the decisions and policies of the various regional jurisdictions within the countrys federal system.
.With regard to the minimum teaching salary (point  of the collective agreement of February ), namely the salary threshold below which no province may set the salary of any teacher, the Government explains that reaching agreement at that time on an automatic mechanism for increasing the minimum teaching salary was a significant step forward. The new mechanism agreed upon with the trade unions entails the automatic increase of the minimum salary, which is updated each year. This joint agreement establishes that the teaching salary must be at least  per cent higher than the minimum living wage, and this adjustment would be automatic, irrespective of any agreement reached in the joint negotiation board for education. For the Government, the clause regarding the automatic increase makes it unnecessary and merely academic to hold discussions on the minimum teaching salary each year. The automatic increase is calculated on the basis of the minimum living wage. This is fixed annually by the Council for the Minimum Living Wage, with the participation of workers, employers and representatives of the national Government and of the Federal Labour Council (provincial governments). Hence, in addition to the amount established annually as the general minimum wage by this Council, there is an extra  per cent as a fixed component of the minimum teaching salary for the year.
.With regard to the Compensation Fund referred to in the complaint from the UDA, this is designed to complement (compensate) the earnings of teachers who do not reach the established minimum threshold. The aim is to help iron out disparities in the initial teaching salary in provinces where, despite financial input into the sector and greater efficiency in the allocation of resources, it is not possible to overcome those inequalities. This is separate from the FONID, which, simply providing incentives as its name suggests, has a totally different function from the Compensation Fund.
.In a communication of March , the Government forwards information provided by the Ministry of Governance, Labour and Justice of the Province of Mendoza regarding the classroom allowance. It states that FLATEC brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court. However, it was withdrawn by the plaintiff. According to the Government, this demonstrates a lack of coherence in that the union renounced any local ruling but decided to pursue the matter at the international level in the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association. It also indicates that: (i) the Province of Mendoza is experiencing a severe financial emergency; (ii) in conformity with the terms of the national joint negotiations signed by the national union representatives on  February , the initial teaching salary was raised by implementing the Compensation Fund, with a further increase in the funds supplied by FONID, and stipulating that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the minimum living wage, irrespective of any agreements reached in the joint negotiation board for education; (iii) the negotiations took place in accordance with all the principles of good faith negotiation. For each proposal made, appropriate efforts were made to reach agreements, within the current economic context and budget of the province; (iv) however, even though the province improved the initial proposal on several occasions, no agreement could be reached. It was here that the increase in the teaching salary was fixed by decree, chiefly safeguarding the right to education and thereby guaranteeing the resumption of classes; and (v) with regard to the classroom allowance, the provincial government considers that the whole complaint is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity. On the contrary, the Government explains that this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism, there has been a substantial improvement in pupil attendance and also a reduction in the number of replacement teachers required. The Government also denies categorically that the classroom allowance is a way for the legislation or Government to penalize the right to strike through substantial losses of teaching salary for just one stoppage or strike day.
.Lastly, the Government attaches a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza, Second Chamber, in the case Single Union of Education Workers v. Government of Mendoza ?claim of unconstitutionality? dated  December , which calls on the Plenary Court to rule on the constitutionality of the legal provisions challenged in the case file (Decree No. / ratified by Act No.",5,2017,Argentina
27," concerning the classroom allowance).
.In its communication of February , which also refers to Cases Nos  and  since they involve similar facts, the Government considers that in all the scenarios under examination agreement had been reached, or was about to be reached, and so the complaints should be disregarded.
.With regard to the threats to the SUTEBA union official, Mr Roberto Baradel, the Government indicates that they are the subject of judicial proceedings before Federal Court No.  and the corresponding criminal investigation proceedings provided for by law have been instituted.
.As regards the statements of the national President, the Government considers that they are part and parcel of democratic debate, and that in any case there have been no judicial complaints in this regard. It is also surprised that the issue has been brought before a supranational body without any recourse to the competent national bodies.
.With regard to the issue of national collective bargaining in education, the Government indicates that the joint agreement of  February  had been signed by the general secretaries of CTERA, the UDA and SADOP. The agreement establishes that, irrespective of what the unions negotiate with the provinces, a minimum salary of ARS, from February and ARS, from July will be guaranteed through the implementation of the Compensation Fund (Education Finance Act No. ) for all the modalities and jurisdictions of the country. There is also an increase in the funds contributed by FONID, which brings the national minimum salary to ARS, from February and to ARS, from July. The agreement also stipulates that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the national living wage (clause  of the agreement).
.The Government reiterates that the payment of teaching salaries is a matter for each of the  provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The fact that national funds have gone to compensate teaching salaries in provinces where they are below the minimum living wage does not mean that the national Government is the employer. The Government reiterates that if the clause regarding automatic adjustment is interpreted correctly, any discussion each year on salaries at national level in relation to teachers?minimum earnings is needless and/or purely academic.
.With regard to the framework agreement, the Government indicates that the parties undertake to establish within  days a working group for the drafting of a framework agreement (collective labour agreement), in accordance with section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ). This lays the foundations of a framework agreement, or the foundations of a new national joint negotiation board for education, which, unlike those adopted in previous years, takes account of the different situations in all the regional jurisdictions of the State, with the sole aim of avoiding the inequalities produced by the previous system, which the national Government had to resolve by contributing more funds to the provinces for the payment of teaching salaries. It points out that the aforementioned section provides for the setting up of a working group to draft a framework agreement, making it clear that collective agreements will be a matter for the provincial jurisdictions. Hence it has been possible to create an automated mechanism for the minimum salary, something that was provided for by law more than ten years ago but which has never been done in practice. It adds that the amparo action Argentine Teachers?Federation v. Ministry of Education and Sport et al.?(Case No. /) produced a ruling which rejected the claim brought by the union (Labour Court No. ).
.With regard to the allegations concerning the Province of Buenos Aires and the recourse to compulsory conciliation, the Government considers that the principal circumstance which gave rise to the order for conciliation was the need to keep schools open because many of them also operate as canteens. However, the dispute has been settled with the adoption of Act No. / of  June  (Agreement with all teachers and their professional organizations involved in the salary dispute in the Province of Buenos Aires?. Specifically, it is stated that the implementing authority has formally approved by an absolute majority the salary proposal for  presented by the provincial government in the joint negotiation document, in accordance with the terms of Act No. .
.With regard to the ARS, bonus, established by the internal regulations of the Province of Buenos Aires, for teachers who taught classes on the days of industrial action since March , the Government indicates that this action was taken with an eye to the resumption of classes, with the aim of giving objective recognition to those who performed their tasks in a clearly extraordinary context, since the strikes were carried out with the pupils inside the classrooms.
.With regard to the allegations of a brutal crackdown by the police of Buenos Aires on account of the setting up of a mobile school, the Government has supplied the report of February  drawn up by the Secretary for Security of the Ministry of Security and Justice of the city of Buenos Aires, which states that the unions did not comply with the regulations governing the occupation of public spaces and that the police acted in line with the provisions of the Comprehensive Public Security System Act (No. ), in particular as regards the proportional use of force.
.The Committee observes that Cases Nos ,  and  are concerned with similar allegations, namely: (i) the refusal of the national Government to resume collective bargaining with the public education sector (issue of the federal joint negotiation board for education); (ii) the unlawful use of compulsory conciliation in the Province of Buenos Aires; (iii) obstruction of the right to strike of teachers in the private sector in the Province of Mendoza through the loss of a salary component (classroom allowance); (iv) threats against a trade union official; and (v) violations of freedom of association in the Province of Buenos Aires (request for the suspension of official trade union status; restriction of the right to strike; and police crackdown).
.The Committee observes that a key element common to the complaints is the complainants?allegation that the public authorities refused to convene the resumption of collective bargaining for addressing the issue of salaries for teachers in the public sector, thereby putting an end to the mechanism of the federal joint negotiation board for education, which had existed since , as regulated by the Education Finance Act (No. ) and Decree No. /. The Committee notes that, according to the information supplied by the complainants, the purpose of the negotiation mechanism, with the involvement of the national teaching unions, was to remove disparities in salaries arising from the transfer of education services to the provinces. The Committee observes that the complainants concur that the Government unilaterally put an end to the social dialogue mechanism provided for in the Education Finance Act and hence failed to meet the obligations arising from ILO Conventions Nos  and . The Committee also notes the indication of CTERA in its additional communication of February  that the national Government adopted Decree No. / entailing the de facto abolition of the collective bargaining system at the national level in the education sector.
.The Committee notes the Governments statement that the central government is not the employer of the teachers and that salary issues are a matter for discussion by the provincial governments. It notes in particular that the Government considers that in view of the tripartite agreement of February  in which a minimum teaching salary was fixed with an automatic adjustment, there is no need for periodic discussions at federal level. The Committee also notes the Governments indications that progress has been made regarding the framework agreement provided for in section  of Act No. , making it clear that collective agreements shall come within the competence of the provincial authorities. The Committee notes the Governments indication that no meeting has been held so far for formulating the framework agreement, that the only meetings held had been at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary and that, while acknowledging the difficulty of the task, steps are being taken to establish the framework agreement.
.The Committee observes that section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ) provides that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in conjunction with the Federal Council for Culture and Education and the teaching unions with national representation shall adopt a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d)the teaching career, but that so far the appropriate conditions had not existed for establishing the framework agreement. The Committee understands, from the information provided by the parties, that the federal joint negotiation board for education was designed to be a forum for dialogue on issues relating to work in the education sector, including salary issues.
.The Committee observes that in the collective agreement of February  concluded within the federal joint negotiation board an automatic mechanism was agreed upon",-1,2017,Argentina
28,"for increasing the minimum teaching salary: the new mechanism agreed upon with the trade unions involves the automatic increase of the minimum salary each year, with the result that, on the basis of the joint negotiations, the teaching salary must be at least  per cent higher than the minimum living wage, and this adjustment would be automatic, irrespective of any agreement reached in the joint negotiation board. In this respect, the Committee notes the different viewpoints of the complainants and the Government. On the one hand, the unions claim that the mere fact of adopting a clause to keep the minimum teaching salary higher than the minimum living wage by a specified proportion ( per cent) cannot mean that the teaching unions shall stop exercising their right to bargain collectively with regard to salaries and conditions of work. On the other hand, the Government considers that because of the clause regarding the automatic increase, there is no need to reopen discussions each year regarding the minimum teaching salary. The Committee also observes that the Governments position is consolidated with the adoption of Decree No. / amending certain sections, and abolishing others, of Decree No. /. The Committee observes that with these amendments the discussions no longer focus on salary issues, since the only requirement is the link between the minimum teaching salary and the minimum living wage.
.The Committee wishes to recall that on several occasions it has drawn attention to the importance of promoting collective bargaining, as set out in Article  of Convention No. , in the education sector [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. While considering that it is not competent to express views on the level ?federal or provincial ?of collective bargaining, and noting the efforts made regarding the implementation of a framework agreement, the Committee also wishes to underline the special importance of salary matters in collective bargaining. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed on salary matters as part of the exercise of collective bargaining, in order to determine the scope of the clause for the automatic adjustment of the minimum teaching salary that the parties to the February  federal joint negotiations agreed on and to ensure that collective bargaining on salary remains possible at all levels.
.The Committee notes that although both the complainants and the Government have mentioned various amparo appeals, no definitive decisions have yet been adopted on the issue of the federal joint negotiation board. The Committee requests the Government to forward the relevant judicial decisions, once they have been issued.
.As regards the abovementioned Decree No. /, which, according to CTERA, entails the de facto abolition of the collective bargaining system at the national level in the education sector, the Committee notes that so far the Government has not supplied any information on the Decree. With regard to the allegation by CTERA that the new Decree disregards the key element of representativeness, the Committee is bound to note in this regard that section  of the Decree substantially alters the previous situation. It provides that the representation in the framework agreement of public sector education workers, in the provinces and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, shall be exercised by one member of each first-, second- and third-level organization having official trade union status and having nationwide geographical scope for teaching, and that if in the course of the negotiations there is no uniformity within the representation of the teachers?unions, that of the majority members shall prevail.
.The Committee also observes that the reference to a list of information which must be in the possession of the parties, and considered to be the minimum necessary for undertaking the required discussions within the framework agreement, has been removed from section  of new Decree No. /. In this regard, the Committee recalls that Article  of the Collective Bargaining Recommendation,  (No. ), which complements Convention No.  ratified by Argentina, provides that measures adapted to national conditions should be taken, if necessary, so that the parties have access to the information required for meaningful negotiations. Hence, while observing the efforts made by the Government to undertake reforms in the education sector, the Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners to determine the appropriate representation of workers in the process of establishing the framework agreement provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ). It also requests the Government to ensure that the parties have the necessary information during the actual negotiations. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on this matter.
.With regard to compulsory conciliation instigated by the Minister of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires, the Committee notes that CTERA denounces the use of compulsory conciliation (consisting of a mechanism in which the labour administrative authority summons the parties to the dispute to a forum for dialogue) as a tool for restricting the right to strike of education workers in the Province of Buenos Aires, since no industrial action may be taken during the period of compulsory conciliation. The Committee notes the indication by CTERA that the trade unions secured protective measures in their favour and that (as at April ) the matter was before the Provincial Supreme Court. The Committee notes the Governments indication that the main factor behind the summons to conciliation was the need to keep schools open since many of them also function as canteens. It also notes the Governments statement that the dispute was settled with the agreement of all teachers and professional organizations involved in the salary dispute in the Province of Buenos Aires (Act No. / dated  June ).
.The Committee recalls that the provision of food to pupils of school age may be considered to be an essential service [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. It also recalls that it has examined several cases from Argentina involving objections to orders for compulsory conciliation between the parties to a dispute in the public education sector by the administrative authority, when the latter was a party in the dispute and that it has considered that it was necessary to entrust the decision of initiating the conciliation procedure in collective disputes to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute (see thReport, Case No. , paragraph ).
.As regards the classroom allowance, which forms part of the salary structure for private tutors, as established by law in the Province of Mendoza, the Committee notes the complainants objection that this salary element has been established for the purpose of obstructing the regular exercise of the right to strike by private tutors. The Committee notes the complainants allegation that if there is just one strike day in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay, and so the right to strike is penalized by an excessive loss of remuneration. The Committee notes the Governments reply indicating that the plaintiff brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court, though this was later withdrawn. The Committee also notes the Governments indication that: (i) the present denunciation is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity; and (ii)on the contrary, this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism.
.The Committee observes that the classroom allowance mechanism does not in itself raise any issue relating to freedom of association. Nevertheless, it considers that it may have indirect repercussions with regard to salary deductions for strike days, where it involves a substantial loss of teaching salary for just a one-day stoppage or strike. On several occasions the Committee has considered that salary deductions for days of strike should only apply to workers who have taken part in the strike or a protest action and that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles [see Compilation, op. cit., paras & ]. However, in a case where the pay deductions were higher than the amount corresponding to the period of the strike, the Committee recalled that the imposition of sanctions for strike action was not conducive to harmonious labour relations [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. In the present case, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the classroom allowance mechanism operating in the Province of Mendoza does not give rise to excessive salary deductions for legitimate strike action. In view of the information provided by the Government, the Committee requests the complainant to indicate the reasons for withdrawing its claim of unconstitutionality concerning the classroom allowance.
.With regard to the allegations by CTERA that the general secretary of SUTEBA, Mr Roberto Baradel, has become the target of death threats, directed at himself and his family, in relation to his role in collective bargaining in the sector which",-1,2017,Argentina
29,"he represents, the Committee notes that these serious threats are the subject of a complaint before Federal Court No.  of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Reiterating that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see Compilation, op.cit., para. ], the Committee urges the Government to provide information as soon as possible on the steps taken to assess the need to provide protection for Mr Roberto Baradel, and on any corresponding measure.
.As regards the proceedings requesting the suspension of the official union status of the UDA, the Committee notes that the latter, in its communication of  October , reiterates that those proceedings were instituted by the Ministry of Labour of the province. In view of the lack of response in this regard the Committee requests the Government to provide information on the trade union status of the UDA.
.With regard to the measures agreed upon by the Ministry of Education ?Province of Buenos Aires ?to recompense workers who did not take part in the strike of  March  with an exceptional payment of ARS,, the Committee notes the Governments indication that this action was taken with an eye to the resumption of classes, with the aim of giving objective recognition to those who performed their tasks in a clearly extraordinary context, since the strikes were carried out with the pupils inside the classrooms. The Committee recalls that on various occasions, concerning measures applied to compensate workers who do not participate in a strike by bonuses, it considered that such discriminatory practices constitute a major obstacle to the right of trade unionists to organize their activities [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. With regard to the allegation by the UDA that in March  the governor of the province called on , volunteers to give educational support to the almost  million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the strike called by the teaching unions at the start of the  academic year, the Committee has indicated, for example, that minimum services may be established in the education sector, in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strikes of long duration [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. While noting the Governments indication that it acted with an eye to the resumption of classes, the Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that the right of trade unions to organize their activities is not obstructed, and that any minimum service is subject to discussions with the trade unions concerned.
.With regard to the allegations of CTERA denouncing a brutal crackdown by the police in the city of Buenos Aires on  April  against workers and officials belonging to the aforementioned union, and also the illegal detention of some of them, for attempting to set up the Mobile School?at the Plaza de los Dos Congresos, the Committee, while noting the report of the Secretary for Security at the Ministry of Security and Justice in Buenos Aires, wishes to recall that freedom of assembly and freedom of opinion and expression are a sine qua non for the exercise of freedom of association. It also recalls that measures depriving trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights, and that the police authorities should be given precise instructions so that, in cases where public order is not seriously threatened, people are not arrested simply for having organized or participated in a demonstration [see Compilation, op. cit., paras ,  and ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of collective bargaining on salary matters, in order to determine the scope of the agreement reached on the clause for the automatic adjustment of the minimum teaching salary in the February  federal joint negotiations and to ensure that collective bargaining on salary remains possible at all levels.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to forward the relevant judicial decisions concerning the federal joint negotiation board, once they have been issued.(c)	The Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners to determine the appropriate representation of workers in the process of establishing the framework agreement provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ). It also requests the Government to ensure that the parties have the necessary information during the actual negotiations. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on this matter.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the classroom allowance mechanism operating in the Province of Mendoza does not give rise to excessive salary deductions for legitimate strike action, and to send the text of any judicial decision in this respect.

.The Government sent its replies in communications dated April  and February and March .
.In view of the fact that the complaints address identical issues, Cases Nos ,  and  will be the subject of a single examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication of  November , the UDA denounces the restriction on collective bargaining for the public teaching sector by the Government, in so far as, unlike the practice followed in previous years and despite insistent complaints by the UDA, it failed to reconvene collective bargaining with a view to revisiting the issue of salaries, despite the fact that teachers?salaries have been strongly affected by rising inflation and the adverse socio-economic context of . It also indicates that a number of points in the collective agreement concluded in February  have not been implemented. The complainant considers that by acting in this way the Government is limiting the percentage increase in teachers?salaries and is obstructing the collective bargaining process, in violation of ILO Convention No. .
.In an additional communication of  May , the UDA declares that the initial complaint now has the support of the Federation of Education Workers (FETE) and of the secretariat for education policies, a subordinate body of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). The UDA indicates that, together with its members, it organized and carried out industrial action from March  in the search for a reformulation of salaries, among other labour claims, since the Government refused to reopen collective bargaining, namely to convene the federal joint negotiation board, and so the fixing of salaries remained in the hands of the State, against a background of  per cent year-on-year inflation. The industrial action, which was lawful and had been notified to the labour authority, received voluntary mass support from teachers in Argentina, who withdrew from their duties. The complainant alleges that, in addition to the failure to convene the joint negotiation board, the State decided to reduce the share of the Compensation Fund (financed by the Government) received by the seven provinces facing the greatest difficulties. According to official announcements, the intention of the Ministry of Education is to reduce that share by  per cent per year, until it disappears altogether in . As regards the Education Incentive Fund (FONID), the UDA states that even though it had been instituted for salary emergencies? it has become a normal and usual complement to teachers?salaries, albeit with the downside that it is not classified as remuneration and hence does not generate social security contributions.
.Considering the salary situation in the Province of Buenos Aires to be unsustainable, the complainant indicates that it filed an action for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) at the end of March . As a protective measure, it requested the convening of the negotiation board provided for under section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ), with implementing regulations laid down by Decree No. /. By a decision of  April , the protective measure was granted in summary proceedings and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was ordered to convene within five days the negotiation board provided for by section  of Act No. . The State appealed against this decision in the National Chamber for Labour Appeals. The proceedings are in progress and no first-instance ruling had been issued by the end of May .
.The UDA adds that on  March  the Government summoned the trade unions to a joint meeting during which it made a proposal consisting of the advance payment of one-off fixed sums not classified as remuneration (considered illegal and not generating contributions to the social security system) for serving employees, the payment being subject to non-implementation of the industrial action called for by the trade unions at the national level for  and  March . As the proposal was rejected, the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires did not put forward any other proposal but served notice of compulsory conciliation on the trade unions. The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on  March  secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On  March , the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.
.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.). In particular, it reports that an application was filed by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. ///).
.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on , volunteers to give educational support to the almost  million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March , at the start of the  academic year.
.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of  March  to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective. It alleges that the recourse to compulsory conciliation constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires and also of Acts Nos  and . The UDA also reiterates that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires initiated the procedure calling for the suspension of its trade union status.
.In its communication dated  February , FLATEC reports that the classroom allowance ?which is an additional component to the salary structure of private tutors based on Act No.  and Decree No.  of the Province of Mendoza ?has actually been established to obstruct the regular exercise of the right to strike of private tutors, through the imposition of fines and the withholding of salary. They state that the monetary allocation constitutes remuneration, and so it entails contributions in the areas of welfare, assistance and union dues, and is to be considered in the calculation of additional annual earnings. The classroom allowance is to be paid from March  for every employee covered by Act No. and its amendments who provides services in the Directorate-General for Schools, has the status of qualified teacher and performs assigned duties on all working days in the respective month, except for absences due to sick leave or accidents or any other leave on objective grounds defined by the abovementioned legislation.
.The complainant objects to the fact that for just one day of strike action in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay. Hence the right to strike is penalized through an excessive loss of pay, which is far greater than the amount that corresponds to the strike day.
.FLATEC also denounces the arbitrary and unlawful failure to implement the collective bargaining procedure of the federal joint negotiation board for education, and describes the historical background to the current dispute. It recalls that, in order to cut costs in educational matters and as part of commitments for the renegotiation of foreign debt, in January  the Executive Authority proposed, and Congress adopted, Act No.  concerning the transfer of education services to the provinces. This transfer resulted in a serious imbalance in the quality of",5,2016,Argentina
31,"education and salary levels between the provinces with fewer financial resources and other provinces. The complainant indicates that in  the Education Finance Act (No. ), among other legal instruments, sought to iron out inequalities and took grievances from the teaching community into consideration. The instruments established by the National Congress included the federal joint negotiation board for education, a national and federal forum in which, with the involvement of the national teachers?unions, including SADOP, conditions of work were regulated and minimum pay for all teachers in the country was agreed on an annual basis, prior to the start of the academic year. In accordance with the Education Finance Act (No. ) and Decree No. /, the federal joint negotiation board for education was formally established through administrative file No.../ in the register of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, where the records establishing the federal joint negotiation board were signed by the State, currently the Ministry of Education and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and the Federal Council for Culture and Education, representing the education ministries of the provinces and the national trade union organizations.
.The complainant emphasizes that, from  to , regular ongoing joint negotiations were held on an annual basis. It maintains that this practice has given rise to a sectoral and administrative custom which produces effects and legal obligations, and so neither the federal Government nor the provincial governments can restrict the federal joint negotiation board. Hence, for the complainant, the decision of the federal Government and initially of a number of provincial governments to nullify the salary negotiations established in the federal joint negotiation board is not an administrative omission whereby nothing was decided despite the request of the national unions; rather, it shows the Governments wish to avoid complying with the Education Finance Act (No. ), as though this Act was not in force. The complainant also claims that this is a violation of Act No. , section  of which provides that teachers throughout the education system shall have rights and obligations, including with regard to a decent salary and collective bargaining at the national and regional levels, and shall also be covered by the obligations arising from ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The complainant considers particularly relevant the protective measure issued by the ruling of the National Labour Court, issued on  April , which ordered that the federal joint negotiation board for education be constituted; however, the political and ministerial authorities announced publicly on  April  that they would appeal against this ruling.
.The complainant also denounces the restrictions of the right to strike of teachers represented by SADOP, imposed by internal regulations of the Province of Buenos Aires, in so far as the latter, by a decision of  March , provided for a one-off exceptional payment of ,Argentine pesos (ARS) not classified as pensionable remuneration for teachers who taught classes on the days of industrial action announced from  March  onwards.
.In its first communication dated  April , CTERA indicates that the Education Sector Collective Bargaining Act of the Province of Buenos Aires has been in force for over ten years and collective negotiations were always resolved in a context of dialogue and in the framework of the law. However, it claims that the situation in the country has changed. From mid-February  the general secretary of the Single Union of Education Workers (SUTEBA), Mr Roberto Baradel, started to receive death threats aimed at himself and his family. The threats, received by email, made specific reference to his role in collective bargaining in the sector that he represents. CTERA adds that these serious threats are the subject of a complaint before Federal Court No.  of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. CTERA denounces the lack of protection and solidarity from the Government.
.The complainant denounces the use of compulsory conciliation (a mechanism whereby the labour administrative authority summons the parties to the dispute to a forum for dialogue) as a tool for restricting the right to strike of education workers in the Province of Buenos Aires, since the union representatives were summoned on  March  to the third meeting of the joint negotiation board for education (Act No. ), at which the Government made a salary proposal similar to the one which had already been rejected. It claims that in such circumstances and within the collective negotiations themselves, the labour minister of the province notified the union representatives of the order for compulsory conciliation (decision No. / of the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires). For CTERA, it is incomprehensible that a mechanism for bringing parties to dialogue should be used when they are already at the negotiating table. It claims that the use of compulsory conciliation by the employer can only be construed as a ploy to restrict the right to strike. This being the case, the trade unions had recourse to the local court to guarantee their rights and they secured a ruling in their favour on  March . CTERA alleges that the government of the Province of Buenos Aires, far from complying with the legal order, sought the participation of another legal entity with a view to overturning the initial court decision. According to the complainant, the matter is before the Provincial Supreme Court. In these circumstances, the trade unions lodged another appeal with the local court and secured another favourable ruling from another provincial magistrate (decision No. / (R.A.) CCALP).
.Lastly, CTERA denounces the joint decision of the Directorate-General of Culture (No. ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs (No. ) of  March , ordering ?in violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and  and of the National Constitution ?the payment of ARS, to teachers who, from  March  onwards, taught classes on days of industrial action.
.In a second communication dated  April , the complainant denounces the refusal of the National Executive to guarantee to education workers the right to collective bargaining. It indicates that collective negotiation at national level in Argentina was initiated within the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security through file No.../ under section  of Act No.  and implementing Decree No./. It also recalls that section  of the Decree prescribes that the provisions of the Decree shall be interpreted in conformity with ILO Convention No.  and that section of the National Education Act (No. ) of December  recognizes the right of all teachers to engage in collective bargaining at the national and regional levels. The complainant indicates that in the  round of negotiations with the current national Government, a collective agreement was reached for a salary increase in February of that year, within the said bargaining entity.
.Despite the clarity of the legislation, since  the State as employer has systematically refused to empower the collective bargaining body, on the grounds that the third clause of the joint agreement of  established an automatic increase of  per cent of the initial teaching salary above the minimum living wage which is to be fixed in accordance with Act No. . According to the complainant, this interpretation of the collective agreement of  is unsustainable, not only because of the clarity of the abovementioned Act, which stipulates compulsory negotiation for the future, but also because the aforementioned minimum figure of  per cent clearly constitutes a threshold resulting from the imbalances which arose in previous years in first negotiating the teaching salary and then the minimum living wage, the former having remained lower than the latter, a situation that the clause in question sought to avoid. For the complainant, that clause could never be used as a pretext for not engaging in collective bargaining. The mere fact of adopting a clause to keep the minimum teaching salary in proportion to the minimum living wage cannot mean that the teachers?unions ?including CTERA, which represents  per cent of education workers ?shall stop the regular exercise of their right to fix salaries and conditions of work.
.In its communication of  February , the complainant denounces the recent adoption by the national Government of Decree No. /, involving the de facto abolition of the national system of collective negotiation in force for education workers. It claims that this is clearly part of a general elimination of the rights of workers in both the public and private sectors in the country, with clear instances of persecution by the Government and some of the provincial administrations.
.For CTERA, Decree No. /, in an unconstitutional manner and violating ILO Conventions Nos ,  and , seeks to amend Act No.  and prevent the fixing of the national minimum salary for the education sector within the federal joint negotiation board. It also objects to the fact that: (i) there is no possibility of discussing or agreeing on the minimum teaching salary as provided for in Act No. ; (ii) the expression of the wishes of the trade unions is not respected by the employer",-1,2016,Argentina
32,"in that the key element of representativeness is disregarded; (iii) there is no right to information on collective bargaining matters since a close examination of the Decree shows that it abolishes the right to information within the joint negotiation board for education itself (section ), thereby denying the unions knowledge of employment levels in the education sector, investment policies, programmes for the introduction of new technologies, etc.; and (iv) there is also no possibility of requesting the Ministry of Labour to set up a board for collective agreement negotiations since section  of Decree No. / has been abolished.
.Lastly, CTERA denounces the brutal crackdown by the police in the city of Buenos Aires on  April  against education workers and union officials belonging to CTERA, some of whom were unlawfully arrested and subsequently released, for attempting to set up the Mobile School?at the Plaza de los Dos Congresos with a view to calling on the Government, in ways other than work stoppages, to convene a national joint negotiation board in the sector. It also claims that the head of State, when referring to the teachers?salary claims, made offensive comments about the education unions.
.In a communication dated  April , the Government states that at no time was there non-compliance on its part which would justify the complaint presented by the UDA. On the contrary, considerable progress had occurred in relation to the previous situation.
.Firstly, the Government makes a clarification regarding the reference to the national Government (to which the Ministry of Education and Sport belongs) as the employer? For the Government, this assertion is far removed from reality. In this regard, it explains that in the early s legislation adopted by the national Congress (Act No.  and complementary legislation) provided that educational establishments that had hitherto been under the auspices of the national Government would now be directly governed by the provinces. Hence the legislation provided at that time for the transfer to the provinces of educational establishments and their teaching and non-teaching staff that until then had been under national direction. Consequently, from that time onwards no educational establishments, or any of the teachers employed there, were any longer under the control of the national Government. Hence it is incorrect to describe the national Government as the employer? There are  different sets of regulations relating to teaching, each of them applicable in their respective area of jurisdiction. According to the Government, this demonstrates that the central government is not the employer? the employers are the provinces plus the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, each having its respective territory.
.As regards the framework agreement (provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ) and referred to in point  of the collective agreement of February ), the Government indicates that it should not be forgotten that even if reference is made to a framework agreement? what is essential is the existence of agreements between the parties in each province. On that basis, from a position already fixed internally, discussions on the framework agreement can begin with the aim of reaching basic agreements at national level. The Government indicates that section  of Act No.  of January  (implemented by Decree No. /), provides as follows: The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (currently the Ministry of Education and Sport) together with the Federal Council for Culture and Education (currently the Federal Council for Education) and the teaching unions with national representation, shall conclude a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d) the teaching career. The Government explains that: (i) although no meetings were held from  to  for the purposes of formulating the framework agreement established in section of Act No.  ?there were only meetings at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary, which had been fixed by agreement with the unions in some cases, while other meetings had been prescribed by decree of the Executive Authority where there was no agreement ?this inaction ceased as from ; (ii) the foregoing does not alter the fact that it is a complicated, difficult task for the various regional jurisdictions, each having its own regulations relating to teachers, to reach basic agreements in relation to the creation of the framework agreement; and (iii) this whole situation goes far beyond the possibilities of the national Government, which depends on the decisions and policies of the various regional jurisdictions within the countrys federal system.
.With regard to the minimum teaching salary (point  of the collective agreement of February ), namely the salary threshold below which no province may set the salary of any teacher, the Government explains that reaching agreement at that time on an automatic mechanism for increasing the minimum teaching salary was a significant step forward. The new mechanism agreed upon with the trade unions entails the automatic increase of the minimum salary, which is updated each year. This joint agreement establishes that the teaching salary must be at least  per cent higher than the minimum living wage, and this adjustment would be automatic, irrespective of any agreement reached in the joint negotiation board for education. For the Government, the clause regarding the automatic increase makes it unnecessary and merely academic to hold discussions on the minimum teaching salary each year. The automatic increase is calculated on the basis of the minimum living wage. This is fixed annually by the Council for the Minimum Living Wage, with the participation of workers, employers and representatives of the national Government and of the Federal Labour Council (provincial governments). Hence, in addition to the amount established annually as the general minimum wage by this Council, there is an extra  per cent as a fixed component of the minimum teaching salary for the year.
.With regard to the Compensation Fund referred to in the complaint from the UDA, this is designed to complement (compensate) the earnings of teachers who do not reach the established minimum threshold. The aim is to help iron out disparities in the initial teaching salary in provinces where, despite financial input into the sector and greater efficiency in the allocation of resources, it is not possible to overcome those inequalities. This is separate from the FONID, which, simply providing incentives as its name suggests, has a totally different function from the Compensation Fund.
.In a communication of March , the Government forwards information provided by the Ministry of Governance, Labour and Justice of the Province of Mendoza regarding the classroom allowance. It states that FLATEC brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court. However, it was withdrawn by the plaintiff. According to the Government, this demonstrates a lack of coherence in that the union renounced any local ruling but decided to pursue the matter at the international level in the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association. It also indicates that: (i) the Province of Mendoza is experiencing a severe financial emergency; (ii) in conformity with the terms of the national joint negotiations signed by the national union representatives on  February , the initial teaching salary was raised by implementing the Compensation Fund, with a further increase in the funds supplied by FONID, and stipulating that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the minimum living wage, irrespective of any agreements reached in the joint negotiation board for education; (iii) the negotiations took place in accordance with all the principles of good faith negotiation. For each proposal made, appropriate efforts were made to reach agreements, within the current economic context and budget of the province; (iv) however, even though the province improved the initial proposal on several occasions, no agreement could be reached. It was here that the increase in the teaching salary was fixed by decree, chiefly safeguarding the right to education and thereby guaranteeing the resumption of classes; and (v) with regard to the classroom allowance, the provincial government considers that the whole complaint is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity. On the contrary, the Government explains that this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism, there has been a substantial improvement in pupil attendance and also a reduction in the number of replacement teachers required. The Government also denies categorically that the classroom allowance is a way for the legislation or Government to penalize the right to strike through substantial losses of teaching salary for just one stoppage or strike day.
.Lastly, the Government attaches a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza, Second Chamber, in the case Single Union of Education Workers v. Government of Mendoza ?claim of unconstitutionality? dated  December , which calls on the Plenary Court to rule on the constitutionality of the legal provisions challenged in the case file (Decree No. / ratified by Act No.",-1,2016,Argentina
33," concerning the classroom allowance).
.In its communication of February , which also refers to Cases Nos  and  since they involve similar facts, the Government considers that in all the scenarios under examination agreement had been reached, or was about to be reached, and so the complaints should be disregarded.
.With regard to the threats to the SUTEBA union official, Mr Roberto Baradel, the Government indicates that they are the subject of judicial proceedings before Federal Court No.  and the corresponding criminal investigation proceedings provided for by law have been instituted.
.As regards the statements of the national President, the Government considers that they are part and parcel of democratic debate, and that in any case there have been no judicial complaints in this regard. It is also surprised that the issue has been brought before a supranational body without any recourse to the competent national bodies.
.With regard to the issue of national collective bargaining in education, the Government indicates that the joint agreement of  February  had been signed by the general secretaries of CTERA, the UDA and SADOP. The agreement establishes that, irrespective of what the unions negotiate with the provinces, a minimum salary of ARS, from February and ARS, from July will be guaranteed through the implementation of the Compensation Fund (Education Finance Act No. ) for all the modalities and jurisdictions of the country. There is also an increase in the funds contributed by FONID, which brings the national minimum salary to ARS, from February and to ARS, from July. The agreement also stipulates that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the national living wage (clause  of the agreement).
.The Government reiterates that the payment of teaching salaries is a matter for each of the  provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The fact that national funds have gone to compensate teaching salaries in provinces where they are below the minimum living wage does not mean that the national Government is the employer. The Government reiterates that if the clause regarding automatic adjustment is interpreted correctly, any discussion each year on salaries at national level in relation to teachers?minimum earnings is needless and/or purely academic.
.With regard to the framework agreement, the Government indicates that the parties undertake to establish within  days a working group for the drafting of a framework agreement (collective labour agreement), in accordance with section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ). This lays the foundations of a framework agreement, or the foundations of a new national joint negotiation board for education, which, unlike those adopted in previous years, takes account of the different situations in all the regional jurisdictions of the State, with the sole aim of avoiding the inequalities produced by the previous system, which the national Government had to resolve by contributing more funds to the provinces for the payment of teaching salaries. It points out that the aforementioned section provides for the setting up of a working group to draft a framework agreement, making it clear that collective agreements will be a matter for the provincial jurisdictions. Hence it has been possible to create an automated mechanism for the minimum salary, something that was provided for by law more than ten years ago but which has never been done in practice. It adds that the amparo action Argentine Teachers?Federation v. Ministry of Education and Sport et al.?(Case No. /) produced a ruling which rejected the claim brought by the union (Labour Court No. ).
.With regard to the allegations concerning the Province of Buenos Aires and the recourse to compulsory conciliation, the Government considers that the principal circumstance which gave rise to the order for conciliation was the need to keep schools open because many of them also operate as canteens. However, the dispute has been settled with the adoption of Act No. / of  June  (Agreement with all teachers and their professional organizations involved in the salary dispute in the Province of Buenos Aires?. Specifically, it is stated that the implementing authority has formally approved by an absolute majority the salary proposal for  presented by the provincial government in the joint negotiation document, in accordance with the terms of Act No. .
.With regard to the ARS, bonus, established by the internal regulations of the Province of Buenos Aires, for teachers who taught classes on the days of industrial action since March , the Government indicates that this action was taken with an eye to the resumption of classes, with the aim of giving objective recognition to those who performed their tasks in a clearly extraordinary context, since the strikes were carried out with the pupils inside the classrooms.
.With regard to the allegations of a brutal crackdown by the police of Buenos Aires on account of the setting up of a mobile school, the Government has supplied the report of February  drawn up by the Secretary for Security of the Ministry of Security and Justice of the city of Buenos Aires, which states that the unions did not comply with the regulations governing the occupation of public spaces and that the police acted in line with the provisions of the Comprehensive Public Security System Act (No. ), in particular as regards the proportional use of force.
.The Committee observes that Cases Nos ,  and  are concerned with similar allegations, namely: (i) the refusal of the national Government to resume collective bargaining with the public education sector (issue of the federal joint negotiation board for education); (ii) the unlawful use of compulsory conciliation in the Province of Buenos Aires; (iii) obstruction of the right to strike of teachers in the private sector in the Province of Mendoza through the loss of a salary component (classroom allowance); (iv) threats against a trade union official; and (v) violations of freedom of association in the Province of Buenos Aires (request for the suspension of official trade union status; restriction of the right to strike; and police crackdown).
.The Committee observes that a key element common to the complaints is the complainants?allegation that the public authorities refused to convene the resumption of collective bargaining for addressing the issue of salaries for teachers in the public sector, thereby putting an end to the mechanism of the federal joint negotiation board for education, which had existed since , as regulated by the Education Finance Act (No. ) and Decree No. /. The Committee notes that, according to the information supplied by the complainants, the purpose of the negotiation mechanism, with the involvement of the national teaching unions, was to remove disparities in salaries arising from the transfer of education services to the provinces. The Committee observes that the complainants concur that the Government unilaterally put an end to the social dialogue mechanism provided for in the Education Finance Act and hence failed to meet the obligations arising from ILO Conventions Nos  and . The Committee also notes the indication of CTERA in its additional communication of February  that the national Government adopted Decree No. / entailing the de facto abolition of the collective bargaining system at the national level in the education sector.
.The Committee notes the Governments statement that the central government is not the employer of the teachers and that salary issues are a matter for discussion by the provincial governments. It notes in particular that the Government considers that in view of the tripartite agreement of February  in which a minimum teaching salary was fixed with an automatic adjustment, there is no need for periodic discussions at federal level. The Committee also notes the Governments indications that progress has been made regarding the framework agreement provided for in section  of Act No. , making it clear that collective agreements shall come within the competence of the provincial authorities. The Committee notes the Governments indication that no meeting has been held so far for formulating the framework agreement, that the only meetings held had been at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary and that, while acknowledging the difficulty of the task, steps are being taken to establish the framework agreement.
.The Committee observes that section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ) provides that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in conjunction with the Federal Council for Culture and Education and the teaching unions with national representation shall adopt a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d)the teaching career, but that so far the appropriate conditions had not existed for establishing the framework agreement. The Committee understands, from the information provided by the parties, that the federal joint negotiation board for education was designed to be a forum for dialogue on issues relating to work in the education sector, including salary issues.
.The Committee observes that in the collective agreement of February  concluded within the federal joint negotiation board an automatic mechanism was agreed upon",-1,2016,Argentina
34,"for increasing the minimum teaching salary: the new mechanism agreed upon with the trade unions involves the automatic increase of the minimum salary each year, with the result that, on the basis of the joint negotiations, the teaching salary must be at least  per cent higher than the minimum living wage, and this adjustment would be automatic, irrespective of any agreement reached in the joint negotiation board. In this respect, the Committee notes the different viewpoints of the complainants and the Government. On the one hand, the unions claim that the mere fact of adopting a clause to keep the minimum teaching salary higher than the minimum living wage by a specified proportion ( per cent) cannot mean that the teaching unions shall stop exercising their right to bargain collectively with regard to salaries and conditions of work. On the other hand, the Government considers that because of the clause regarding the automatic increase, there is no need to reopen discussions each year regarding the minimum teaching salary. The Committee also observes that the Governments position is consolidated with the adoption of Decree No. / amending certain sections, and abolishing others, of Decree No. /. The Committee observes that with these amendments the discussions no longer focus on salary issues, since the only requirement is the link between the minimum teaching salary and the minimum living wage.
.The Committee wishes to recall that on several occasions it has drawn attention to the importance of promoting collective bargaining, as set out in Article  of Convention No. , in the education sector [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. While considering that it is not competent to express views on the level ?federal or provincial ?of collective bargaining, and noting the efforts made regarding the implementation of a framework agreement, the Committee also wishes to underline the special importance of salary matters in collective bargaining. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed on salary matters as part of the exercise of collective bargaining, in order to determine the scope of the clause for the automatic adjustment of the minimum teaching salary that the parties to the February  federal joint negotiations agreed on and to ensure that collective bargaining on salary remains possible at all levels.
.The Committee notes that although both the complainants and the Government have mentioned various amparo appeals, no definitive decisions have yet been adopted on the issue of the federal joint negotiation board. The Committee requests the Government to forward the relevant judicial decisions, once they have been issued.
.As regards the abovementioned Decree No. /, which, according to CTERA, entails the de facto abolition of the collective bargaining system at the national level in the education sector, the Committee notes that so far the Government has not supplied any information on the Decree. With regard to the allegation by CTERA that the new Decree disregards the key element of representativeness, the Committee is bound to note in this regard that section  of the Decree substantially alters the previous situation. It provides that the representation in the framework agreement of public sector education workers, in the provinces and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, shall be exercised by one member of each first-, second- and third-level organization having official trade union status and having nationwide geographical scope for teaching, and that if in the course of the negotiations there is no uniformity within the representation of the teachers?unions, that of the majority members shall prevail.
.The Committee also observes that the reference to a list of information which must be in the possession of the parties, and considered to be the minimum necessary for undertaking the required discussions within the framework agreement, has been removed from section  of new Decree No. /. In this regard, the Committee recalls that Article  of the Collective Bargaining Recommendation,  (No. ), which complements Convention No.  ratified by Argentina, provides that measures adapted to national conditions should be taken, if necessary, so that the parties have access to the information required for meaningful negotiations. Hence, while observing the efforts made by the Government to undertake reforms in the education sector, the Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners to determine the appropriate representation of workers in the process of establishing the framework agreement provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ). It also requests the Government to ensure that the parties have the necessary information during the actual negotiations. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on this matter.
.With regard to compulsory conciliation instigated by the Minister of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires, the Committee notes that CTERA denounces the use of compulsory conciliation (consisting of a mechanism in which the labour administrative authority summons the parties to the dispute to a forum for dialogue) as a tool for restricting the right to strike of education workers in the Province of Buenos Aires, since no industrial action may be taken during the period of compulsory conciliation. The Committee notes the indication by CTERA that the trade unions secured protective measures in their favour and that (as at April ) the matter was before the Provincial Supreme Court. The Committee notes the Governments indication that the main factor behind the summons to conciliation was the need to keep schools open since many of them also function as canteens. It also notes the Governments statement that the dispute was settled with the agreement of all teachers and professional organizations involved in the salary dispute in the Province of Buenos Aires (Act No. / dated  June ).
.The Committee recalls that the provision of food to pupils of school age may be considered to be an essential service [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. It also recalls that it has examined several cases from Argentina involving objections to orders for compulsory conciliation between the parties to a dispute in the public education sector by the administrative authority, when the latter was a party in the dispute and that it has considered that it was necessary to entrust the decision of initiating the conciliation procedure in collective disputes to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute (see thReport, Case No. , paragraph ).
.As regards the classroom allowance, which forms part of the salary structure for private tutors, as established by law in the Province of Mendoza, the Committee notes the complainants objection that this salary element has been established for the purpose of obstructing the regular exercise of the right to strike by private tutors. The Committee notes the complainants allegation that if there is just one strike day in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay, and so the right to strike is penalized by an excessive loss of remuneration. The Committee notes the Governments reply indicating that the plaintiff brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court, though this was later withdrawn. The Committee also notes the Governments indication that: (i) the present denunciation is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity; and (ii)on the contrary, this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism.
.The Committee observes that the classroom allowance mechanism does not in itself raise any issue relating to freedom of association. Nevertheless, it considers that it may have indirect repercussions with regard to salary deductions for strike days, where it involves a substantial loss of teaching salary for just a one-day stoppage or strike. On several occasions the Committee has considered that salary deductions for days of strike should only apply to workers who have taken part in the strike or a protest action and that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles [see Compilation, op. cit., paras & ]. However, in a case where the pay deductions were higher than the amount corresponding to the period of the strike, the Committee recalled that the imposition of sanctions for strike action was not conducive to harmonious labour relations [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. In the present case, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the classroom allowance mechanism operating in the Province of Mendoza does not give rise to excessive salary deductions for legitimate strike action. In view of the information provided by the Government, the Committee requests the complainant to indicate the reasons for withdrawing its claim of unconstitutionality concerning the classroom allowance.
.With regard to the allegations by CTERA that the general secretary of SUTEBA, Mr Roberto Baradel, has become the target of death threats, directed at himself and his family, in relation to his role in collective bargaining in the sector which",-1,2016,Argentina
35,"he represents, the Committee notes that these serious threats are the subject of a complaint before Federal Court No.  of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Reiterating that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see Compilation, op.cit., para. ], the Committee urges the Government to provide information as soon as possible on the steps taken to assess the need to provide protection for Mr Roberto Baradel, and on any corresponding measure.
.As regards the proceedings requesting the suspension of the official union status of the UDA, the Committee notes that the latter, in its communication of  October , reiterates that those proceedings were instituted by the Ministry of Labour of the province. In view of the lack of response in this regard the Committee requests the Government to provide information on the trade union status of the UDA.
.With regard to the measures agreed upon by the Ministry of Education ?Province of Buenos Aires ?to recompense workers who did not take part in the strike of  March  with an exceptional payment of ARS,, the Committee notes the Governments indication that this action was taken with an eye to the resumption of classes, with the aim of giving objective recognition to those who performed their tasks in a clearly extraordinary context, since the strikes were carried out with the pupils inside the classrooms. The Committee recalls that on various occasions, concerning measures applied to compensate workers who do not participate in a strike by bonuses, it considered that such discriminatory practices constitute a major obstacle to the right of trade unionists to organize their activities [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. With regard to the allegation by the UDA that in March  the governor of the province called on , volunteers to give educational support to the almost  million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the strike called by the teaching unions at the start of the  academic year, the Committee has indicated, for example, that minimum services may be established in the education sector, in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strikes of long duration [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. While noting the Governments indication that it acted with an eye to the resumption of classes, the Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that the right of trade unions to organize their activities is not obstructed, and that any minimum service is subject to discussions with the trade unions concerned.
.With regard to the allegations of CTERA denouncing a brutal crackdown by the police in the city of Buenos Aires on  April  against workers and officials belonging to the aforementioned union, and also the illegal detention of some of them, for attempting to set up the Mobile School?at the Plaza de los Dos Congresos, the Committee, while noting the report of the Secretary for Security at the Ministry of Security and Justice in Buenos Aires, wishes to recall that freedom of assembly and freedom of opinion and expression are a sine qua non for the exercise of freedom of association. It also recalls that measures depriving trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights, and that the police authorities should be given precise instructions so that, in cases where public order is not seriously threatened, people are not arrested simply for having organized or participated in a demonstration [see Compilation, op. cit., paras ,  and ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of collective bargaining on salary matters, in order to determine the scope of the agreement reached on the clause for the automatic adjustment of the minimum teaching salary in the February  federal joint negotiations and to ensure that collective bargaining on salary remains possible at all levels.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to forward the relevant judicial decisions concerning the federal joint negotiation board, once they have been issued.(c)	The Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners to determine the appropriate representation of workers in the process of establishing the framework agreement provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ). It also requests the Government to ensure that the parties have the necessary information during the actual negotiations. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on this matter.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the classroom allowance mechanism operating in the Province of Mendoza does not give rise to excessive salary deductions for legitimate strike action, and to send the text of any judicial decision in this respect. The Committee also asks the complainant to indicate the reason for withdrawing its claim of unconstitutionality regarding the classroom allowance.(e)	The Committee urges the Government to provide information as soon as possible on the steps taken to assess the need to provide protection for the SUTEBA general secretary, Mr Roberto Baradel, and on any corresponding measure.(f)	The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the situation of the UDA with regard to the request for the suspension of its official union status made by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires.(g)	The Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that the right of trade unions to organize their activities is not obstructed, and that, in cases of strikes of long duration, any minimum service is subject to discussions with the trade unions concerned.",-1,2016,Argentina
36,".The complaint is contained in communications from the Trade Union Federation of Healthcare Workers of the Argentine Republic (FESPROSA) dated  June ,  September , February  and  May .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  April ,  August ,  September and  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  June ,  September ,  February  and  May , FESPROSA, which claims to represent healthcare professionals working in public establishments and bodies throughout the country, alleges that the State, as an employer, has violated the right to collective bargaining of several of its affiliated trade union organizations in various provinces of the country.
.The complainant alleges that, after receiving an invitation from the Government of the Province of Santa Cruz to engage in collective bargaining for the health sector on  June , it sent the Government, in writing, the names of the two delegates who would attend the meeting on its behalf and on behalf of its affiliate, the Trade Union Association of Public Health Workers of Santa Cruz (APROSA). The complainant alleges that, while the Government did not object to its communication, when the delegates arrived at the meeting site on  June, the police questioned them and would not let them to enter. The complainant indicates that this situation was recorded by the media and that, afterwards, they went to the provincial Ministry of Labour and a report of the incident was drawn up. The complainant indicates that, to date, it has not been able to take part in the bargaining.
.The complainant alleges that the State has refused to allow the Association of Professionals and Technicians of the Dr Juan P. Garrahan SAMIC Paediatric Hospital (a first-level entity with union registration, affiliated with FESPROSA, with majority representation in the hospital) participate in sectoral bargaining. The complainant also alleges that it has been denied a physical space within the establishment for its union headquarters as well as the possibility of automatically deducting union dues from its members?wages, even though other unions operating in the sector are able to do so. The complainant alleges that the hospitals board of directors, which consists of representatives of the National Government and of the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, has denied them these rights under the pretext that it does not have trade union status.
.The complainant alleges that for eight years the Trade Union Association of Healthcare Workers of the Province of Buenos Aires (CICOP) (a first-level union with trade union status, affiliated with FESPROSA, with a scope of action in the Province of Buenos Aires) has been excluded from the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Healthcare Work (COPICPROSA) under the pretext that it lacks national representation. The complainant indicates that this committee is the body responsible for applying the collective agreement for national hospital workers established in  by means of Decree No. / and indicates that the relevant actors had agreed that the trade union part would be represented by the relevant unions, including CICOP, of which most Posadas Hospital workers are members. The complainant alleges that, despite this agreement, the hospitals management has not allowed CICOP to participate in this committee.
.The complainant also alleges that FESPROSA, which also has trade union status, has been excluded from this committee. It further alleges that the hospital provides CICOP with a small office when the other unions have two or three spaces. It also alleges discrimination against its members: the contract of a member who had recently joined was terminated after  years of employment and  workers, some of whom had recently become members, had  per cent of their wages arbitrarily deducted without any explanation.
.The complainant alleges that on  January , the hospital authorities made public the decision to dismiss  workers, most of whom were night-shift workers and members of CICOP who had had  per cent of their wages deducted by the hospital for failing to comply with a resolution that increased working hours. The complainant also states that after CICOP sent the hospitals management and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security the list of delegates elected on  October ,  of them were dismissed (all of whom were highly qualified, demonstrated impeccable professional conduct, without proceedings or sanctions, and had been working at the hospital for between  and  years) and that the national ministerial authorities and the hospitals management refused to engage in any dialogue with the union representatives despite repeated requests for meetings, measures of force and mobilizations at the hospital. The complainant also alleges that on  January , the hospitals management stopped deducting the entitys membership fees after more than  years, affecting the unions assets and defunding its activities.
.The complainant alleges that, although the Union of University Healthcare Workers (SIPRUS), affiliated with FESPROSA, is the most representative entity of healthcare workers in the public sector, it is prevented from participating in collective bargaining because it does not have trade union status. The complainant indicates that SIPRUS has been registered as a union since  and that although it requested the Ministry of Labour to conduct a membership comparison in , it was not until  that it was informed that the comparison was about to begin. The organization is concerned that this arbitrary delay in the comparison has resulted in bargaining in the province with a sector that is foreign to the legitimate interests of SIPRUS.
.The complainant indicates that the Province of Crdoba is covered by the Union of Healthcare Workers (UTS), the most representative union in the provincial public health sector, which is affiliated with FESPROSA and has simple union registration. The complainant states that there are four trade union organizations in the provincial public administration and that, with exception of the UTS, the other three (the Public Employees Union (SEP) of the Province of Crdoba, the Association of State Workers (ATE) and the Association of Argentine Healthcare Workers (ATSA)) have trade union status. The complainant states that ATE and ATSA are unions with a scope of action throughout the Argentine Republic, but that only ATSA specifically covers the healthcare sector, albeit with little representation in the public health sector in the Province of Crdoba, where the UTS represents the absolute majority. The complainant states that, although in the province there is no bargaining specifically and exclusively for the health sector, the UTS has never been invited to participate in general bargaining. The complainant also states that even though a sectoral health board has been meeting to address the demands of workers in the provincial public healthcare system since , the UTS has formally submitted a list of demands at every meeting that has never been addressed. It further indicates that at practically all these meetings, it has expressed a desire to be invited to participate in general bargaining, as well as the need for bargaining specifically and exclusively for the health sector.
.The complainant alleges that the Government of the Province of Chaco refuses to invite the Association of Public Health Professionals, Technicians and Assistants of the Province of Chaco (APTASCH), an organization affiliated with FESPROSA that claims to be the most representative organization for the health sector with , members, to participate in collective bargaining. The complainant alleges that the Provincial Government disregards the unions representation, its demands, and the very serious deterioration of working conditions. The complainant also alleges that the Provincial Government ignores the judgments of the Supreme Court of Justice, such as its judgment in ATE versus the Ministry of Labour, which states that exclusive trade union status undermines freedom of association and that unions with simple union registration can participate in sectoral bargaining just as unions with trade union status do.
.The complainant alleges that the Government of the Province of Neuqun denies the Union of Public Health Workers of Neuqun (SIPROSAPUNE) the right to participate in collective bargaining and that this is a result of an omission by the State itself, which has failed to issue the corresponding trade union status, which has been technically approved but not yet issued, in a timely manner. The complainant states that this situation is arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory, since it has completed all the formalities, complied with all the recommendations, and yet both procedures are paralysed, leaving them hostage to a situation that was neither sought nor agreed to.
.In its communication of  April , the Government provides observations in relation to the allegations concerning the Province of Santa Cruz. In its communication of  August , the Government provides observations on the Posadas Hospital in the Province of Buenos Aires and in its communication sent on  September , the Government provides observations regarding several of the",0,2016,Argentina
37,"other provinces mentioned in the complaint. In the latter communication, the Government indicates that, despite the time that has elapsed, the complainant has not insisted on its presentation. The Government also indicates that the claims made by the complainant have not been accompanied by evidence of greater representativeness to support and legitimize the request(s) for the required comparison of representativeness. In its communication sent on  October , the Government sends updated information in relation to some of the provinces mentioned in the complaint.
.The Government indicates that the main issue raised in the complaint concerns the trade union organizations?role of representation in the institutional spheres where working conditions are discussed, which the system of freedom of association and its provisions have reserved for the most representative organizations. The Government indicates that the national legislation is clear regarding representativeness and that, under the Trade Union Associations Law No. . and its Regulatory Decree No. /, it is possible to distinguish three different classes or types of trade union entities, based on a strictly temporal/gradual approach: (i) unregistered trade union associations, (ii) associations with simple union registration and (iii) associations with trade union status. The Government explains that a trade union association exists from the very moment a group of workers gets together and decides to form a permanent entity to defend its interests. This means that the affectio societatis of the group of workers, accompanied by certain acts, such as holding meetings, drafting a founding act and discussing bylaws, is sufficient to create the association. It is to be expected that by this stage, the categories of persons and geographical area to be represented, as well as the name, bylaws and founding authorities will have to be specified, all of which usually occurs after agreeing on criteria during successive meetings convened for this purpose.
.The Government indicates that the creation of a workers' trade union association is a spontaneous act by the group, which does not require prior authorization from the state authority, and that union registration with the Ministry of Labour suffices. The Government indicates that the associations that prove to be the most representative of the group are the ones that negotiate working conditions because they have trade union status. This status is used to designate the organizations that are able negotiate working conditions. The Government explains that this status cannot be granted without making the necessary comparison to determine which organization is the most representative in accordance with the procedure in article  of the Trade Union Associations Law No. .. Failure to meet the indicated requirements will result in the annulment of the administrative or judicial act. Once the comparison has been made, the representation must be recognized without any further procedure.
.With regard to the Province of Santa Cruz, in its communication sent in , the Government indicates that: (i) APROSA is an association with simple union registration and (ii) although the Federation of Argentine Healthcare Workers' Associations (FATSA) is the entity that represents the health sector and participates in bargaining due to its trade union status, the necessary steps were being were taken to analyse granting trade union status to APROSA. In its communication sent on  September , the Government indicates that the complainant has not included any evidence in the complaint of a request for comparison or of a comparison being made to displace the organizations representing the workers in the workplace. The Government indicates that it does not have any information that would allow it to establish that APROSA has the largest number of members in the workplace that it claims to represent. In its communication sent on  October , the Government indicates that: (i) there was not any arbitrary or unilateral decision to exclude APROSA and FESPROSA from participating in the bargaining in June , but rather that, at that time, the organizations did not comply with the requirements demanded by the national and provincial legislation; ii) on  August , members of the Secretary of State for Labor and Social Security and of the Ministry of Health and Environment met with APROSA and FESPROSA and indicated to them what was the necessary documentation to be submitted to be part of the negotiating table, assuring that there was commitment and political will for them to be part of the bargaining; and iii) since  September , FESPROSA-APROSA have been participating in the bargaining and have one vote.
.As to the Posadas Hospital in the Province of Buenos Aires, in its communication of , the Government sent a copy of the report issued by the Undersecretariat of Labour Relations and Strengthening of the Civil Service of the Ministry of Modernization rejecting the request by FESPROSA to join COPICPROSA for that hospital and the other hospitals and national institutions covered by the collective agreement. The report states that as FESPROSA is not a signatory to the sectoral collective agreement that created the above-mentioned committee, it would not be appropriate to grant its request.
.In its communication sent in , the Government indicates that Law No. . applies to the representation of trade unions in the State. The law is clear and not only provides for plural representation at both the national and sectoral levels (article ), but also states that if the trade unions are unable to agree on the composition of the representative delegation, the delegation may be established by the State, with percentages based on representation (article ). The Government indicates that the complainant has not included any evidence in the complaint to suggest that there was a negotiation between the trade union organizations or a disagreement over which organizations would participate in COPICPROSA. The Government emphasizes that there is no data, number of members, or organizations that have participated in the comparison, and that the State cannot intervene if it is not first clearly established that there is no agreement, because that would violate union autonomy in a broad sense. It would be an imposition without knowing the arguments of each side, as it would mean that the workers were not involved in the discussion to establish representation. The Government considers this to be an internal matter of the unions, which precludes the State from intervening until the unions decide on the matter. The Government indicates that this is an internal disagreement and that the unions must establish the representativeness. If there is no agreement, the State may intervene, but it does not seem appropriate for the State to impose agreements before the dispute between the parties has been resolved, when the law empowers all of them. Dialogue and the possibility of an agreement are favoured and determine intervention by the State.
.The Government considers that the allegations concerning the Province of Crdoba are misplaced and have no factual or legal basis. The Government states that: (i) FESPROSA, as a second-level entity, does not have trade union status in the Province of Crdoba (that is, it does not represent the direct interests of workers in the provincial health sector); and (ii) the UTS carries out its trade union activities within the scope of article  of the Trade Union Associations Law No. ., as a first-level entity with simple union registration. The Government states that the UTS has never established its trade union status and emphasizes that the recognition of trade union status does not stem from a unilateral voluntary act by the employer or a unilateral decision by the trade union, but that, in accordance with the national regulatory framework, the conditions stipulated in the applicable regulations must be met.
.The Government indicates that, although the complainant alleges that there is no collective bargaining in the provincial public health sector, the assessment of FRESPROSA is erratic. The Government indicates that collective bargaining in the provincial public health sector is long-standing and has strong institutional roots in the province. Collective bargaining consists of an area that includes two defined sectors: (a) general staff regulated by Law No.  (including hospital administrative support staff and staff working in the central area of the Ministry) and (b) human healthcare teams (regulated by Law No. ). The Government indicates that the framework regulating the bargaining process is provided for in Law No.  and its regulatory decree and Law No. , which establishes the competence of the Ministry of Labour. In this context, the parties comprising the bargaining unit are the health authorities, members of the general secretariat under the Ministry of Coordination and the three unions that have trade union status.
.The Government indicates that the general staff is represented by the Union of Public Employees (SEP) (trade union membership No. /) in the executive staff section and by the Union of Senior Staff in the Provincial Public Administration of Crdoba (UPS) (trade union membership No. ) in the managerial staff section. As to the group consisting of human healthcare teams, it is represented by SEP and ATSA, which specifically represent the health sector according to their respective statuses. Both entities have sufficient accredited representation of contributing members",4,2016,Argentina
38,"for the representation.
.As to the Province of Santa Fe, the Government indicates that this is a request to participate in the bargaining committee, when there is no evidence that there has been a comparison of representativeness or, at least, any initiative or administrative evidence showing that the complainant wanted to resolve which categories of persons it represented with the current trade union status holder, the Medical Association of the Argentine Republic.
.The Government indicates that the complainant has not even attempted to conduct a comparison with the Medical Association of the Argentine Republic, which covers all physicians regardless of their specialty, including the physicians that SIPRUS claims to represent. The Government indicates that it would have to determine which organization has more members and that, in this case, everything seems to indicate that, even though the representation has not been determined, a mandate to participate in the advisory committee is assigned, with degrees of institutional participation commensurate with the de facto representation it claims to hold. The law thus ensures institutional levels of participation, even for an organization with union registration, reserving the ability to bargain working conditions collectively for those who hold the greatest representativeness through their trade union status.
.With regard to APTASCH (Province of Chaco), the Government indicates that, even though the complaint alleges that it is the most representative organization in the health sector, no documentation or evidence of any request for a comparison with the organization that currently holds the negotiating representation has been attached to the complaint.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant (FESPROSA), which represents professionals working in public healthcare establishments in the country, alleges that several of its affiliated organizations have been excluded from collective bargaining in various provinces of the country because they do not have trade union status. The complainant also alleges delays in the granting of trade union status, refusal to deduct union dues because of a lack of trade union status and other acts of anti-union discrimination against several of its affiliated organizations.
.The Committee observes that the Government sends its observations in this regard and indicates that, under Argentine law, there are three types of trade union entities: unregistered trade union associations, associations with simple union registration and associations with trade union status. The Government indicates that, while the creation of a workers' association does not require prior authorization and that union registration with the Ministry of Labour suffices, the associations that are the most representative of the group are those that have trade union status and are able to negotiate working conditions. In general terms and in relation to the various provinces, the Government indicates that the claims made in the complaint have not been accompanied by evidence of the greater representativeness of the organizations affiliated with FESPROSA that would support and legitimize the request for a comparison of representativeness.
.The Committee notes that one of the issues raised in the complaint is the right of only those trade union organizations with trade union status, and not those that are simply registered, to participate in collective bargaining. The Committee notes from the complaint and the Government's reply that, out of the seven trade union organizations affiliated with FESPROSA: (i) only CICOP (Posadas Hospital of Buenos Aires) has trade union status; (ii) four trade union organizations have simple union registration: APROSA (Province of Santa Cruz), SAMIC (Garrahan Hospital of Buenos Aires), the APTASCH (Province of Chaco) (even though the complainant indicates that it is the most representative union in the health sector, the Government indicates that no documentation or evidence of any request for a comparison with the organization that currently holds the negotiating representation has been attached to the complaint), the UTS (Province of Crdoba) (even though the complainant indicates that in the province there is no bargaining specifically for the health sector, the Government indicates that collective bargaining in that sector is long-standing and that there are three unions with trade union status); and (iii) SIPROSAPUNE (Province of Neuqun), which supposedly applied for trade union status, and SIPRUS (Province of Santa Fe), which supposedly requested a comparison of members.
.The Committee notes from the complaint and the Governments reply that the organizations affiliated with FESPROSA that have simple union registration have not been able to participate in collective bargaining because they do not have trade union status. The Committee observes that, according to the Government, the Trade Union Associations Law No. . distinguishes trade union organizations that are simply registered from those that have trade union status and are recognized by the State as being the most representative in their geographical area and that, under the provisions of article , trade union organizations with trade union status have the exclusive right to participate in collective bargaining. The Committee recalls in this regard that systems based on a sole bargaining agent (the most representative) and those which include all organizations or the most representative organizations in accordance with clear pre-established criteria for the determination of the organizations entitled to bargain are both compatible with Convention No. . The Committee also recalls that the granting of exclusive right to the most representative organizations should not mean that the existence of other unions to which certain involved workers may wish to belong is prohibited. Minority organization should be permitted to carry out their activities and at least to have the right to speak on behalf of their members and to represent them. [See Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, paras  and ].
.In relation to the APROSA (Province of Santa Cruz), the Committee notes that, even though the complainant does not indicate if the APROSA had applied for trade union status, the Government indicates that the granting of trade union status to APROSA was analysed in , and in any event affirms that, since  September , APROSA and FESPROSA have been participating in the bargaining in relation to the health sector.
.With regard to SIPRUS (Province of Santa Fe), the Committee notes that, while the complainant claims that it is the majority organization in its area of representation; that in , it submitted its request for a comparison and that in , it was informed that the comparison was about to begin, the Government indicates that the complainant has not sent any evidence that the organization has wanted to resolve which categories of persons it represented with the current trade union status holder, which covers all physicians regardless of their specialty, including those that SIPRUS claims to represent. While noting the divergent position of the parties, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that, if indeed SIPRUS has requested a membership comparison, such a comparison has actually been conducted in a timely manner. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.As to SIPROSAPUNE (Province of Neuqun), the Committee notes that the complainant alleges that the State has not issued the corresponding trade union status, which has been technically approved but not yet issued, in a timely manner. The Committee observes that the Government has not provided any information in this regard. The Committee recalls that it has previously examined complaints against the Government of Argentina concerning allegations of excessive delays in the granting of recognition to organizations, and also recalls that in  it urged the Government to take measures to ensure that in future, when requests were made for the registration of an organization or the granting of recognition, the competent administrative authorities would decide on the matter without unjustified delay [see Report No. , Case No. , para. ]. Recalling the importance of the Government taking measures to ensure that, when requests are made for the granting of trade union status, the administrative authorities decide on the matter without unjustified delay, and noting with concern the absence of up-to-date information on the granting of trade union status to SIPROSAPUNE, the Committee hopes that this process has concluded and requests the Government to provide information in this regard.
.The Committee notes that, in relation to CICOP (Posadas Hospital, Province of Buenos Aires), the complainant alleges that despite the fact that it has trade union status and that in the process that led to the adoption of Decree No. / establishing the sectoral collective agreement for professional staff in hospital and healthcare establishments and research and production institutes under the Ministry of Health, the relevant actors had agreed that CICOP would be represented in COPICPROSA (the body responsible for implementing the collective agreement established in ), it was not allowed to participate because it lacks national representation"". The Committee notes that, in this respect, the Government indicates that: (i) the complainant has not included any evidence in the complaint to suggest that there was a negotiation between the trade union organizations on participation in COPICPROSA, which would make this an internal matter of the unions and preclude the State from intervening until the unions decide on the matter; and (ii) the Undersecretariat of Labour Relations and Strengthening of the Civil Service",0,2016,Argentina
39,"of the Ministry of Modernization rejected the request by FESPROSA to join COPICPSOSA because it is not a signatory to the sectoral collective agreement that created the above-mentioned committee.
.The Committee observes that article  of the Decree No.  provides that the trade union part of COPICPROSA shall be represented by five regular and five substitute members. It also establishes that only trade union organizations with trade union status may participate in the committee, in accordance with Law No. ., and that the organizations whose representation is limited to one or more of the establishments shall be incorporated into the jurisdictional delegations of those bodies. The article also states that these organizations shall be invited to participate in any COPICPROSA meetings that deal with issues affecting the category of persons and geographical area covered by them. The Committee observes that, although it does not have more specific information on a possible agreement between the organizations on their participation in COPICPROSA, according to publicly available information, in May , CICOP took part in the COPICPROSA bargaining team. In the light of the above, and having received no further information on this matter, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization also alleges that: (i) the Garrahan Hospital in Buenos Aires does not allow SAMIC to automatically deduct union dues under the pretext that it does not have trade union status; and that (ii) in January , the Posadas Hospital in Buenos Aires stopped deducting CICOP's membership fees after more than  years. The Committee regrets that it has not received any observations from the Government in this regard.
.The Committee recalls that, in previous cases concerning Argentina, it requested the Government to take measures to ensure that with respect to the deduction of trade union dues from wages, legislation does not discriminate against trade union organizations that are merely registered as opposed to those with trade union status [see Report No. , Case No. , para.]. The Committee also recalls that for many years the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has been requesting the Government to take the necessary measures to bring several provisions of the Trade Union Associations Law No. . into full conformity with the Convention, including article , which allows only associations with trade union status, but not those that are simply registered, to deduct union dues from wages. Emphasizing the importance of the Government taking the aforementioned measures, and having received neither observations from the Government on this matter nor up-to-date information from the complainant, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that both SAMIC and CICOP are able to automatically deduct union dues in the hospitals concerned and requests the Government and the complainant to provide information in this regard.
.The Committee notes that the complainant also alleges other acts of anti-union discrimination against members of CICOP (Posadas Hospital, Province of Buenos Aires). While taking due note of the allegations, which include the decision allegedly taken by the hospitals management in early  to dismiss more than  workers, most of whom were union members, as well as the alleged dismissal of  elected delegates of CICOP, without proceedings or sanctions, after CICOP communicated its list of elected delegates on  October , the Committee notes that the complainant has not provided specific data that would enable the workers in question to be identified or information on whether administrative or judicial appeals were filed in this regard. While noting that the Government has not sent its observations on this matter, and taking into account the time that has elapsed without having received specific information on the alleged facts, unless the complainant provides such information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this aspect of the case. Noting, however, that the complainant also indicates that the ministerial authorities and the hospitals management refused to engage in any dialogue with the union representatives despite repeated requests for meetings, measures of force and mobilizations at the hospital, the Committee recalls that it has highlighted the importance for harmonious labour relations of full and frank consultations on matters affecting the workers?occupational interests.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the complainant alleges that the management of the two hospitals in the Province of Buenos Aires does not provide SAMIC and CICOP with adequate physical space for their operations while other trade union organizations supposedly enjoy the necessary facilities. While noting that it has not received any observations from the Government on this matter, the Committee recalls that it has underlined the need to strike a balance between two elements: (i) facilities in the undertaking should be as such to enable trade unions to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently and (ii) the granting of such facilities should not impair the efficient operation of the undertaking [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, para. ]. In the light of the above, the Committee requests the Government to encourage dialogue between the hospital authorities and the trade union organizations concerned in order to define the facilities necessary for carrying out their activities that are compatible with the smooth functioning of the hospitals and commensurate with their level of representativeness.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that, if indeed SIPRUS has requested a membership comparison, such a comparison has actually been conducted in a timely manner. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) Recalling the importance of the Government taking measures to ensure that, when requests are made for the granting of trade union status, the authorities decide on the matter without unjustified delay, and noting with concern the absence of up-to-date information on the granting of trade union status to SIPROSAPUNE, the Committee hopes that this process has concluded and requests the Government to provide information in this regard.(c) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that both SAMIC and CICOP are able to automatically deduct union dues at the Garrahan and Posadas hospitals and requests the Government and the complainant to provide information in this regard.(d) The Committee requests the Government to encourage dialogue between the hospital authorities and the trade union organizations concerned in order to define the facilities necessary for carrying out their activities that are compatible with the smooth functioning of the hospitals and commensurate with their level of representativeness.",-1,2016,Argentina
40,".The complaint is set out in communications dated  June and  December  from the Unified Trade Union of Fuegian Education Workers (SUTEF) and the Independent Confederation of Workers of Argentina (Independent CTA).
.The Government provided its observations in a communication in May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  June and  December , SUTEF and Independent CTA allege a refusal to hold discussions, replacement of workers, salary deductions, declaring a strike illegal, and anti-union measures in the context of industrial action in the public education sector of Tierra del Fuego province.
.The complainants state that, on  and  January , the Legislature of Tierra del Fuego province approved legislation comprising a series of bills tabled by the executive on December . The legislation included the declaration of a social security emergency and other measures relating to social security and its institutions in the province, such as modifications to the system of workers?benefits. According to the complainants, the measures implied a decrease of up to approximately . per cent in the nominal net salaries of teachers, with the introduction of extraordinary contributions (from about  to about .per cent) during the emergency period (two years extendable for a further two years), a -point increase in regular contributions (from  to  per cent) and changes in the objective criteria for obtaining retirement benefits at the expense of workers.
.Following the entry into force of the legislation, all public workers?organizations in the province demonstrated on  March  to obtain a hearing with the executive and legislative authorities. The Governor refused to receive the trade union representatives; a pro government legislator convened the workers the following day, but the meeting was unfruitful. It was at that point that all the trade unions called for direct action, which lasted for about  days without obtaining any form of response from the executive or legislative authorities. The executive refused to hold a round-table dialogue with a view to drawing up draft legislation derogating from or replacing the laws in question. The legislative authorities did not even agree to discuss the partial reform or modification of the legislation in committee. The dispute was prolonged because there were absolutely no channels of communication.
.The complainants allege that the Government decided to end the dispute by taking measures infringing freedom of association. They state that, on  April , the Ministry of Education issued Resolution No. /, which established, on the basis of an emergency administrative decree (No. / of  March ) and in contravention of national and international law, that striking workers could be replaced by hiring temporary workers (for a period of time subject to the eventual return to work of the striking workers). The complainants point out that teaching is not an essential service for which measures of this kind might be justified and allege that the mechanisms set out in domestic legislation for declaring a public service an essential service in a particular situation were not respected. They recall that a strike may be called for reasons that have nothing to do with the collective bargaining process, such as to claim rights infringed by legislative measures. Likewise, the complainants report that their salaries were docked for the days of work stoppage even though the strike was not declared illegitimate, with deductions in some cases amounting to  per cent of salaries. They state that these matters were raised in a judicial appeal (CaseNo.), a ruling on which is pending.
.The complainants likewise report that Resolution No. / of the Under-Secretariat of Labour, which declared that the strike was unlawful on the grounds that its purpose fell outside the reach of collective labour law, was intended to limit the scope of a strike to issues in respect of which the employer is competent to meet demands. They consider that absurd as it would render unlawful many of the legitimate strikes called by trade unions. They recall that the purpose of the action called by SUTEF was to oppose modifications affecting workers?living, working and social security conditions.
.According to the complainants, the competent authorities have a generally negative attitude towards social dialogue, not only on the legislative matters referred to above but also on labour issues. In that regard, they allege that throughout  the authorities refused to agree to joint meetings to discuss salaries, working conditions and other matters (the organizations allude to Resolution No. / of the Under-Secretariat for Labour, decreeing the closure and archiving of action relating to joint meetings, and to Resolution No. / of the Ministry of Education, decreeing the suspension of union leave for teachers taking part in joint activities).
.The complainants also report that the authorities refuse to hold discussions about the situation of workers in cultural workshops. They report that, after the change in administration, the authorities closed all the cultural workshops as of January  and the workshop facilitators lost their jobs. The complainants likewise refer to the precarious employment situation facing those workers. They state that, as the trade union representing the interests of cultural workers (on the basis of the recognition of the sector as non-formal education in article  of Provincial Education Law No. ), SUTEF called for the establishment of a negotiating committee in order to engage in collective bargaining on the regulations governing the specific work of workshop facilitators with a view to eliminating that precarious employment situation. In that regard, the complainants report that the authorities negotiated in bad faith: even though Resolution No. / of the Under-Secretariat of Labour (the authority engaging in collective bargaining involving the provinces teachers) ordered the start of negotiations between SUTEF and the Culture Secretariat, the Secretariat refused to take part; and even though the Ministry of Labour convened another meeting, that meeting was again postponed at the request of the Culture Secretariat. The complainants further indicate that, during the resulting dispute ?involving not just those workers but a large majority of state workers ?the Culture Secretariat started to reinstate the workshop facilitators in a process plagued by discriminatory irregularities, the workers to be reinstated being selected on the basis of no objective criteria.
.In addition, the complainants allege that they were subject to anti-union harassment by the provincial authorities, who took three types of measures. First, the complainants report that administrative steps were taken to lift the trade union immunity of  teacher workers?delegates (with a view to their dismissal) for having participated in trade union activities. According to the complainants, in ten of the  cases the administration has already requested that trade union immunity be lifted (however, in two of those ten cases the first notification and the subsequent proceedings have been declared null and void, with the process having to start again). In the remaining seven cases, the proceedings are at the appeal stage (without trade union immunity having been lifted since the appeals were deemed to have a suspensive effect).
.Second, the complainants report that criminal proceedings have been instigated against teacher workers?delegates in the following cases: (i) Case No.  (Appeal No. /), in which nine teacher delegates were convicted in connection with the events that took place on  May  in the context of industrial action and were given suspended sentences of between eight months and two years in prison; an extraordinary appeal is currently pending before the provinces Supreme Court of Justice; and (ii) Case No. /, in which three SUTEF delegates were tried in connection with the violent dispersal by the police of a peaceful -day demonstration in front of the government building. The complainants allege that the examining magistrate harassed the trade union delegates and that, in his decision of  August , he found them guilty of the crimes of resisting authority and causing bodily and material harm, among others. The decision (which the complainants consider invalid because two of the three members of the bench did not explain their vote) has been appealed and the appeal remains pending.
.Third, the complainants allege anti-union practices consisting of the following: (a)modification of their leaders?working conditions in the form of salary reductions (a complaint for unfair practices filed in that regard by SUTEF on  November  is currently pending); (b) interference in and restriction of their trade union activities through the refusal to grant the corresponding time credits; and (c) the elimination of union leave and the prohibition of meetings and assemblies in the workplace.
.Lastly, the complainants request the establishment of a forum for dialogue so as to channel the present dispute.
.In its communication of May , the Government provides the observations of the provincial authorities concerned on the allegations of the complainants.
.The provincial authorities take the preliminary view that some of the issues raised by the complainants are inadmissible as they have nothing to",0,2016,Argentina
41,"do with freedom of association or collective bargaining.
.First, the provincial authorities consider the complaint about the supposed violation of the right to engage in collective bargaining inadmissible. According to the provincial authorities, SUTEF started the dispute in order to collectively negotiate the total or partial derogation from, or replacement of, the legislation concerned. They therefore consider that the dispute lay outside the reach of collective bargaining with the employer, the subject being beyond the authority of the executive and collective bargaining possibilities. They further state that the legislation that gave rise to the dispute was not subject to collective bargaining as it does not involve matters relating to employment conditions but is instead strictly circumscribed within social security legislation.
.Second, the provincial authorities assert that the allegations relating to the supposed violation of the employment rights (alleged precarious employment situation) of the so called facilitators?of cultural workshops should also be deemed inadmissible. They state that, although the allegations may be of concern to the trade unions, they do not come under the Committees remit. Without prejudice thereto, the provincial authorities provide additional information on the situation. First, they point out that the trade union status of SUTEF encompasses teaching staff providing services in state-run schools?and that the workshop facilitators are not covered by that definition since they do not provide services within the scope of State schools or the Ministry of Education (but rather the Culture Secretariat); SUTEF therefore cannot claim to represent those workers. Second, the provincial authorities indicate that the decisions taken by the authorities were intended to improve the management of the cultural workshops, which involved the adoption of a new regulatory framework following an exhaustive analysis (irregularities having been identified in its past application), and to strengthen the administrative and technical structure and ensure greater transparency, efficiency and effectiveness and better access for the general population. The provincial authorities provide detailed information on the procedure followed and consider the assertion that workers were reinstated on a discriminatory or criteria-free basis to be completely false (they also point out that many of the facilitators who complained were reinstated).
.In a further preliminary statement, the provincial authorities indicate that the complainants omitted to provide information on the acts of violence that took place in the context of the industrial action. Those acts resulted in various judicial ?in some cases, criminal ?proceedings that are currently pending. The provincial Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security indicates that the dispute, which lasted for almost  days, prevented and obstructed not only educational but also government activities, owing to the fact that the protest surrounded the provincial seat of government, preventing public officials from entering the building. The Ministry indicates that the industrial action involved disproportionate violence, undemocratic slogans and criminal acts. It gives the following examples: (i) national road No. , the only overland route to the town of Ushuaia, was cut off despite repeated court injunctions to the contrary (leading to several criminal charges); (ii) in order to cut off the supply of fuel to the province, on  April , a fuel depot was blockaded and the premises surrounded by wood-burning pickets in a serious hazard to public safety; (iii) these acts were accompanied by highly threatening and intimidating demonstrations, as described in various criminal cases, different kinds of sabotage and damage to public property, and acts of aggression such as those publically inflicted on the Vice-Governor; and (iv) in the schools, workers trying to perform their duties were not only threated but also hurt. The provincial authorities consider that such displays of violence are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.Referring to the alleged refusal to hold discussions and reinstate workers, the provincial authorities state that, despite the violence deployed in the industrial action, the Provincial Government reacted to the dispute by convening the trade unions in joint commissions in order to discuss the dispute among the items subject to the collective negotiation of working conditions. This proved impossible, however, because SUTEF refused, demanding to discuss only questions that were not subject to collective bargaining and refusing to stop the direct action it had started. The Provincial Government was therefore obliged to take appropriate measures to protect the rights of children attending public schools, and after days it decided to implement an exceptional and temporary class make-up programme. The provincial authorities specify that the programme was in no way an attempt to replace the striking workers; instead, in the face of the social harm caused by the prolongation of the dispute it sought to minimize the harmful consequences for children by establishing minimum services. The provincial authorities assert that, owing to the prolongation of the dispute, the provinces judicial authorities required the executive to consider the adoption of minimum services that would limit the damage being done. The Provincial Government, in adopting the class make-up programme called into question by the complainants, considered that the criteria established by the Committee were applicable to the strike in the education sector, noting that even though education could not, strictly speaking, be termed an essential service, in cases in which a dispute was extended the possibility of establishing minimum services was not an infringement of freedom of association, in particular taking into account the principle of the higher interest of the child. The provincial authorities further indicate that the exceptional conditions that gave rise to the programme were the result not only of the strike but also of the critical situation of the provinces education system. They deny that the programme was an attempt to replace the strikers since the make-up teachers had a different purpose (to make up for lost classes as additional human resources guaranteeing the right to learn); indeed, when a striking worker was reinstated, the two teaching functions were maintained alongside each other in the classroom. In addition, the make-up teachers were retained even after the dispute had ended and the decision was made to prolong the programme in question in the expectation that the exceptional situation would last longer since a great many classroom days had been lost.
.Regarding the deductions made for days of strike, the provincial authorities recall that according to the Committee such deductions give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has not criticized the legislation of member States stipulating salary deductions for days of strike, and that the domestic regulations and case law take account of those principles and establish that, in the event that a service is not provided because of direct action, the employer has the right to make the relevant deductions. The provincial authorities indicate that the court of first instance dismissed the suit for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) filed by SUTEF in that regard.
.Regarding the declaration that the strike was illegal, the Provincial Government states that, while it is not unaware of the Committees position that declarations of this type should not be made by an administrative body, it considers that the declaration did not imply any anti union practices. In that regard, the provincial authorities assert the following: (i) the strike, in addition to stopping education for more than three months, paralysed the Governments administrative and labour-related activities almost entirely, obliging the executive to issue Decree No. / of  March  declaring a state of administrative emergency; (ii) in Resolution No. /, the provincial Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security declared the industrial action carried out by SUTEF on  May  to be unlawful on the grounds that the grievance had nothing to do with the employment relationship and exceeded the purpose of a labour dispute ?in other words, on the grounds that the matter in dispute had nothing to do with the industrial relationship, there being no grievances involving labour or working conditions that could have been resolved by the provincial executive in its role as the employer; (iii) according to the case law and legal doctrine, industrial action must be decreed in the context of exclusively contractual disputes arising from the employment relationship, and the application for amparo filed by SUTEF was therefore dismissed at first instance, the judge considering that the strike was based on criticism of the law but that there was no evidence of a dispute with the state employer; (iv)of the more than  days of strike called in an attempt at widespread violence on the part of demonstrators and trade unionists, only one day was the subject of the declaration of unlawfulness; and (v) no measures or reprisals were adopted as a consequence of the declaration (it stipulated no effective legal consequences).
.The Committee observes that this case concerns allegations of anti-union harassment and discrimination on the grounds of participation in industrial action, refusal to hold discussions, replacement of workers, salary deductions and declaring a strike illegal, in the context of an industrial dispute in the public education sector of Tierra del Fuego Province.
.The Committee notes, on the",3,2016,Argentina
42,"one hand, the complainants?allegation that, as a result of industrial action taken in a dispute relating to the adoption of legislation on the social security system, the authorities engaged in anti-union harassment in the form of judicial action, including various criminal trials and proceedings to waive the judicial protection of trade union leaders with a view to their dismissal. On the other hand, the Committee notes that the provincial authorities provide detailed information on the conduct of many violent, undemocratic and even criminal activities in the context of the trade unions?industrial action and indicate that those activities resulted in various judicial proceedings, including criminal trials, which remain ongoing. The Committee recalls that the mere fact of taking part in picketing and firmly but peacefully inciting other workers to keep away from their workplace cannot be considered unlawful. The case is different, however, when picketing is accompanied by violence or coercion of non-strikers in an attempt to interfere with their freedom to work; such acts constitute criminal offences in many countries [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. Stressing that the right to strike is not an absolute right and that the acts alleged by the Government such as the use of violence, sabotage, damage to public property and the creation of serious hazards to public safety would, if proven, go beyond the limits of its protection, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about the outcomes of the judicial proceedings currently pending against the trade unionists.
.The Committee observes that a key aspect of the complaint is the allegation that, throughout the dispute on social security legislation, the authorities refused to engage in discussions with the trade union organizations concerned, in particular SUTEF, and subsequently blocked the holding of joint meetings in  to negotiate matters pertaining to working conditions. The Committee notes that the provincial authorities deny that they objected to discussions, stating that, on the contrary, once the dispute had emerged and despite the many acts of violence carried out, they invited the organizations concerned to joint meetings to discuss labour issues. The provincial authorities nonetheless state that their efforts to channel the dispute through collective bargaining were unfruitful owing to the lack of cooperation by SUTEF, which insisted on discussing solely the matter of social security legislation. In that regard, the Committee observes, on the one hand, that the provincial authorities consider that the subjects of the dispute raised by the complainants on social security legislation fall outside the Committees competence and exceed the scope of collective bargaining with the employer. The provincial authorities state that the trade unions demand (to derogate from or amend the legislation) has nothing to do with the executive and cannot be collectively negotiated. On the other hand, the Committee observes that the complainants do not request the executive to examine the legislation in question or to determine whether there existed a right to collective bargaining in respect of the legislation, but rather request the establishment of a forum for dialogue in order to resolve the dispute, recalling in that respect that the legislation concerned was presented and approved by the executive itself. While recalling that questions concerning social security legislation fall outside its competence and recognizing the right of states to legislate in that area, the Committee recalls that while the refusal to permit or encourage the participation of trade union organizations in the preparation of new legislation or regulations affecting their interests does not necessarily constitute an infringement of trade union rights, the principle of consultation and cooperation between public authorities and employers?and workers?organizations at the industrial and national levels is one to which importance should be attached. In this connection, the Committee has drawn attention to the provisions of the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ). The Committee has further emphasized the value of consultations with organizations of employers and workers during the preparation and application of legislation which affects their interests [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. The Committee regrets that, according to the information provided, the authorities preparing and applying the draft legislation did not conduct prior consultations with their social partners on a matter ?social security reform and special measures (including an increase in contributions and modifications of the conditions for obtaining retirement benefits) ?that directly affects the workers?interests. Having taken due note that the provincial authorities stress their prioritization of social dialogue, the Committee invites the Government to request the said authorities to establish a commission or other forum of social dialogue with the workers?organizations concerned, with a view to establishing mechanisms for consultations with the social partners on the preparation and application of legislation affecting their interests, and to deal with any issue that may remain pending, in particular with regard to promoting collective bargaining on working conditions and employment. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.
.Regarding the complainants?allegations about the workshop facilitators (reports about their precarious employment situation, dismissals, reinstatements and failed collective bargaining attempts), the Committee observes that the provincial authorities consider that the allegations are inadmissible on the grounds that they relate to labour issues that are outside the Committees competence. In that respect, the Committee recalls that, while it is not competent in relation to the facilitators?working conditions, it is competent to examine their enjoyment and exercise of the rights to freedom of association and to engage in collective bargaining. In that regard, the Committee observes that the complainants allege that the authorities raised obstacles to prevent the facilitators from engaging in collective bargaining through SUTEF by failing to show up at joint committee meetings convened for that purpose. In that regard, the Committee notes the following: (i) on the one hand, the provincial authorities state that SUTEF has recognized trade union status to represent and negotiate on behalf of teaching staff providing services in State-run schools?and the workshop facilitators do not fall within that group; and (ii) on the other hand, the complainants assert the following: (a) SUTEF is the trade union representing the interests of those workers given that the law recognizes that cultural workers are part of the non-formal education system; (b) based on that legislation, SUTEF requested the authority with competence for collective bargaining to establish a joint committee; and (c) a resolution of the Labour Under-Secretariat ruled in favour of the opening of negotiations between SUTEF and the Culture Secretariat but the Secretariat refused to participate. While it does not have the information it needs to adopt a position on this divergence between the parties, the Committee nonetheless observes that the right of this group of workers to engage in collective bargaining is in no way called into question and asks the Government to request the competent authorities to engage in collective bargaining in relation to the cultural workshop facilitators.
.Regarding the allegation that workers were replaced in response to the strike, the Committee notes that, according to the indications of the provincial authorities: (i) additional teachers were hired not to replace workers but rather as a minimum service mechanism (the provincial authorities state that they based the decision on the Committees principles relating to the possibility of establishing minimum services in the education sector owing to the long duration of the strike ? days at the time of the decision, extending to about days); and (ii) owing to the exceptional circumstances facing the education system, the additional teachers hired continued to perform their duties after the striking workers had been reinstated and even for an additional period following the end of the dispute. The Committee recalls that in cases of a strike of long duration in the education sector minimum services may be established in full consultation with the social partners [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.Regarding the allegations of salary deductions, the Committee recalls that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.Regarding the allegations that the strike was declared unlawful in an administrative resolution, the Committee notes that the provincial authorities state the following: (i) the resolution was adopted in respect of a single day (of the almost  days that the strike lasted and in a context of direct action in which almost all the Governments work had been paralysed) and the declaration stipulated no measure, reprisal or other legal consequence; and (ii) the direct action of  May  was declared unlawful on the grounds that the subject of the dispute had nothing to do with the employment relationship, there being no employment-related or working condition-related demands that it would have been within the authority of the provincial executive to resolve in its role as employer. In that regard, the Committee wishes to recall that the responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the government but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties",3,2016,Argentina
43,"involved, and that the right to strike should not be limited to industrial disputes that are likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement, but that workers and their organizations should be able to express in a broader context, if necessary, their dissatisfaction as regards economic and social matters affecting their members?interests [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee invites the Government to request the competent provincial authorities to establish a committee or other social dialogue body with the workers?organizations concerned, in order, in conformity with the principles of freedom of association, to address matters relating to the promotion of collective bargaining on working conditions and employment and on the right to strike in the education sector. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(b)	Stressing that the right to strike is not an absolute right and that the acts alleged by the Government such as the use of violence, sabotage, damage to public property and the creation of serious hazards to public safety would, if proven, go beyond the limits of its protection, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about the outcomes of the judicial proceedings (criminal charges and waiver of union immunity) against trade unionists in the context of the events that occurred during the direct action referred to in the complaint.",3,2016,Argentina
44,".The complaint is contained in communications from the Civil, Social, Cultural and Sporting Association of Tpac Amaru, the Association of State Workers (ATE) and the Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA Workers) dated  April,  August and  November .
.The Government provided its observations in the communications dated  March and October , and  March .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications dated  April,  August and  November , the complainant organizations allege that, in the context of a strike and a collective dispute that occurred in Jujuy province in December , the constitutional rights of worker members of cooperatives were undermined, and the unlawful detention was ordered of Ms Milagro Sala, head of the Civil, Social, Cultural and Sporting Association of Tpac Amaru, a civil association affiliated to CTA Workers.
.Information in the documents annexed to the complaints indicates that Tpac Amaru is a grassroots and indigenous political group founded in the late nineties in the province of Jujuy that aims at revitalizing the most underprivileged sectors of the province through the management of housing, health, employment and education programmes by local cooperatives run by the residents. The documents also indicate that Ms Sala is an indigenous social activist with a strong commitment to human rights, indigenous peoples and the neglected and excluded. She has contributed to rebuilding the civil society of the province by creating decent work and providing free, high-quality education and health services, thus weaving a new social fabric.
.The complainant organizations indicate that, after taking office as provincial governor on December , Mr Gerardo Morales suspended the payments made to the cooperatives, thus failing to comply with the agreements and commitments for public works entered into by the provincial state and, in response to this situation, the members of the cooperatives decided to peacefully occupy the Belgrano square from  December in search of a forum to negotiate with the provincial executive branch. The complainant organizations state that the Tpac Amaru organization sent three communications requesting an audience with the Governor but did not receive a response. They also state that, while the Governor officially remained silent, he communicated via the media that he would not meet with the organization and merely insulted and stigmatized Ms Sala, making groundless accusations of inexistant crimes against her.
.The complainant organizations state that, on  January , the provincial executive branch issued Decree No. /G-, which launched an alleged regularization of the cooperatives, called the plan for the regularization and transparency of cooperatives and social benefits? providing for the re-registration and coercion of individuals and social organizations. The complainant organizations cite various articles of the Decree which, in addition to establishing a plan for regularizing and re-registering cooperatives and social benefits, instructed the Public Prosecutors Office to initiate the process of stripping civil associations of their legal status for crimes committed during the occupation of the square and ordered the exclusion from housing plans, benefits and programmes of individuals and organizations that continued to participate in the occupation. The complainant organizations allege that, under the provisions of the Decree, Ms Sala was detained on  January  on the charges of instigating crimes and unrest?in the context of a collective labour dispute with the cooperatives of the organization she represented and the peaceful occupation of the square. The complainant organizations indicate that Ms Sala was detained at the police station until  January when she was transferred to a womens prison.
.The complainant organizations consider the above-mentioned Decree to be unconstitutional as it infringes on the protection of cooperatives and demonstrates the executive branchs extorsion of individuals and civil associations exercising the right to protest and strike. They also consider that the measures applied by the judiciary of the province of Jujuy, and the public statements made by the provincial Governor (newspaper articles are attached) constitute ideological and political persecution, making the detention of Ms Sala the unlawful detention of a trade union leader in the context of a collective dispute. The complainant organizations understand that the measures taken supressed the right to peaceful protest of the worker members of the cooperatives and the intervention of the police authorities at the location of the protest restricted a form of protest, in violation of Convention No. . The complainant organizations add that, in an opinion issued in , the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that the deprivation of liberty of Ms Sala was arbitrary and requested the Government to release her immediately.
.In its communications dated  March and  October , and  March , the Government indicates that the Tpac Amaru organization is a civil association and not a trade union, established for social, cultural and sports purposes, which is not registered in the registry of trade unions and does not meet the requirements to be considered a trade union and therefore falls outside of the remit of the ILO supervisory system. The Government stresses that it is a neighbourhood grassroots organization that does not have the objective of protecting workers?rights. The Government also states that the fact that Tpac Amaru is affiliated to CTA Workers, which is a trade union and accepts the affiliation of social organizations, does not mean that the purpose that the interested parties themselves had in mind upon its establishment can be changed.
.The Government adds that Ms Sala is not a trade union leader and has not been elected or appointed as such by a trade union organization and that, according to information provided to the Government, Ms Sala ceased to belong to the Tpac Amaru association in April , as shown in the associations file in the legal persons department of the State Prosecutors Office of the province of Jujuy. The Government also indicates that the complaint does not indicate the scope of Ms Salas participation in the organization or the defence of the rights of workers and/or cooperative members who were allegedly at the Belgrano square, nor does it indicate whether she participated in the representation of any specific trade union organization. The Government considers that the complaint is essentially flawed since there is an absence of a trade union association of which Ms Sala could be considered a representative or leader.
.The Government also states that it cannot be concluded from the complaint that there was a collective labour dispute arising from a negotiation between workers and employers and that it is incorrect to speak of a collective dispute as this is a phenomenon originating in the world of work that is referred to a resolution mechanism involving employers and workers in which workers are represented by delegates and/or leaders of a representative trade union organization covering specific personnel and a specific territory. According to the Government, none of these elements is demonstrated in the matters raised in the complaint.
.The Government indicates that: (i) characterizing the peaceful occupation as a strike undertaken by workers and linked to the right to organize that is protected under Conventions Nos  and  is clearly unjustified since the circumstances referred to in the complaint do not reflect collective bargaining and a collective labour dispute in the sense protected under the Conventions; (ii) the occupation took place four days after the Governor took office and Decree No./G- aimed to regularize social organizations and cooperatives, therefore the activities carried out during the occupation represented action of a political nature; and (iii)there had been no collective dispute and no union leader is identified who has experienced the deprivation, limitation and/or curtailment of any right or of freedom of association. The above-mentioned Decree indicates that the methods of assistance and state aid that had been implemented until  December  had failed because they had been devoid of any type of state control and there were certain organizations that exercised a discretionary and quasi-governmental control over these public funds, so the Decree intended to register and regularize cooperatives and people benefiting from housing programmes, social plans and food and other benefits, in rejection of the violent methods of protest such as occupations, road blocks, and destruction of public and private property, and, among other acts of violence, the forceful action undertaken by the social organizations led by Ms Sala.
.The Government states that the Governor had no option but to clear the occupation from the square since there was a huge mass of tents and gazebos that covered not only the square but also the main thoroughfares of the city, meaning that it was not only an occupation of a park but an abrupt traffic disruption that particularly affected public passenger transport and had a direct impact on the businesses in the surrounding area, amounting to a siege of the city. The Government adds that the occupation?began to unfold on the second working day of the Governments administration, with obvious acts of intimidation against the democratically elected Government, before the Government",0,2016,Argentina
45,"could have issued any administrative act.
.The Government indicates that: (i) on  January , Ms Sala was summoned to a hearing to inform her of the charges brought against her and she undertook to identify herself to the Personal Records Department, an obligation with which she failed to comply, she also undertook to abstain from any act that could hinder the discovery of the truth and the application of criminal law, which she also failed to do; and (ii) on  January, based on her procedural conduct and personal stance taken following the hearing, the judge ordered her detention, which was extended until  January when her mandated period of detention ended and a secured bail bond was imposed. Notwithstanding, Ms Sala continued to be held in pretrial detention by court order due to her alleged crimes of unlawful association, defrauding the public administration and extortion.
.The Government provides information in relation to the status of the various court cases in which Ms Sala is being investigated and for which she has been deprived of her liberty. According to the documentation provided by the Government, these include the following court cases:
.The Government stresses that Ms Salas right to individual freedom has not been restricted in any way for trade union reasons and that she is being detained as a result of standard judicial proceedings with full guarantees of due process. The Government annexed a copy of a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ//CS) from , handed down in the case of Sala, Milagro Amalia Angela and others accused of unlawful association, defrauding the State and extortion? in which it ordered compliance with the request of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights of  November  to immediately adopt the necessary measures to safeguard effectively the life, personal integrity and health of Ms Sala, in particular by replacing her pretrial detention with house arrest and providing her with the medical and psychological care that she required and agreed to.
.The Committee notes that the present case concerns the alleged unlawful detention of Ms Milagro Sala, leader of the Tpac Amaru Civil Association, who has been detained since the beginning of , and the alleged undermining of the constitutional rights of worker members of cooperatives. The Committee notes that, according to the complaint and its annexes, Tpac Amaru is a grassroots and indigenous political group founded in the late nineties in the province of Jujuy which aims at revitalizing the most underprivileged sectors of the province through the management of housing, health, employment and education programmes by cooperatives.
.The Committee notes the complainant organizations?allegations that: (i) four days after taking office, the Governor of the province of Jujuy suspended payments to the cooperatives and the cooperatives decided to undertake a peaceful occupation of a public square in search of a forum to negotiate with the provincial executive branch; (ii) not only did the Governor not meet with the cooperatives, but he threatened and stigmatized Ms Sala, making baseless accusations of inexistant crimes against her; (iii) one month later, Decree No. /G- was issued, which launched an alleged regularization of cooperatives and social benefits, instructed the Public Prosecutors Office to initiate the process of withdrawing the legal status of civil associations for crimes committed during the occupation of the square and provided for the exclusion from plans and programmes of those who continued the occupation (the complainant organizations consider that the Decree infringes on the protection of cooperatives and demonstrates the extortion of the executive branch of individuals and civil associations exercising the right to protest and strike); and (iv) three days after the Decree was issued, Ms Sala was detained on the alleged charges of instigating crimes and unrest? which is evidence of the ideological and political persecution of the leader. The Committee notes that, according to the complainant organizations, in  the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that the deprivation of liberty of Ms Sala was arbitrary and requested her immediate release.
.The Committee notes in this respect the Governments indications that: (i) Tpac Amaru is a civil association rather than a trade union, Ms Sala is not a trade union leader, there was no collective dispute arising from a negotiation between workers and employers and the characterization of the peaceful occupation as a strike is unfounded; (ii) according to Decree No. /G-, certain organizations exercised discretionary and quasi-governmental control over public funds and it was necessary to register and regularize the cooperatives, in rejection of the violent methods of protest such as occupations, road blocks and destruction of public and private property; (iii) Ms Sala was detained by court order owing to her suspected involvement in crimes for which she had been charged in various cases, including unlawful association, defrauding the public administration and extortion in a case that is currently before the Supreme Court of Justice; and (iv) the Supreme Court of Justice ordered compliance with the request of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to adopt protective measures to safeguard the life, personal integrity and health of Ms Sala, particularly by placing her under house arrest as an alternative to pretrial detention.
.The Committee observes that, from the documentation provided by the complainant organizations and the Government it is apparent that the occupation, in which mainly social organizations and cooperative members participated, was undertaken in protest of the action taken by the new Governor to suspend payments to cooperatives. The Committee takes note of the Resolution adopted by the th Conference defining the Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE), which includes cooperatives, and calls on members to ensure that workers in the SSE benefit from freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.?The Committee also recalls its previous conclusion that the special situation of workers with regard to cooperatives, in particular as concerns the protection of their labour interests and considers that such workers should enjoy the right to join or form trade unions in order to defend those interests [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. However, the Committee notes that in this particular case it does not seem to be apparent from the information and documents provided that the protest action taken by the members of the cooperative arose from a labour dispute or that the measures taken by the regional Governor of Jujuy had repercussions on the exercise of trade union rights. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the allegations related to the violation of the constitutional rights of the worker members of the cooperatives.
.With regard to Ms Sala, the Committee notes that, according to publicly available information, she remains under house arrest. It also notes that in a judgment issued on  December  the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the Jujuy courts  decision sentencing Ms Sala to  years?imprisonment for unlawful association, defrauding the public administration and extortion. According to this decision, the Supreme Court of Justice understood that the sentence had already been reviewed by the Superior Court of Jujuy and the defence had not been able to demonstrate that there had been a violation of a right enshrined in federal law or that it was an arbitrary judgment, which would enable the federal Supreme Court to intervene.
.The Committee notes that the documentation provided does not show that the court cases for which Ms Sala was sentenced to imprisonment were related to the exercise of trade union activities or to the exercise of activities of another nature that could have affected the exercise of trade union rights insofar as Ms Sala was convicted of the crimes of unlawful association as a leader, defrauding the public administration and extortion. According to the documentation provided, such acts were allegedly carried out in the context of the activity of an organization that presented as characteristic features a high degree of coordination, with a modus operandi that involved intimidation and top-down management by the defendant of a political and social organization set up to receive public funds for social purposes and divert them for the benefit of the unlawful association under investigation. The Committee recalls that it has considered that when it appeared from the information available that the persons concerned had been judged by the competent judicial authorities, with the safeguards of normal procedure, and sentenced on account of actions which were not connected with normal trade union activities or which went beyond the scope of such activities, the Committee has considered that the case called for no further examination [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee therefore considers that this case does not call for further examination and is closed.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions and taking into account that the issues examined in this case do not concern trade union rights, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not require any further examination.",2,2016,Argentina
46,".The complaints are contained in a communication dated  June  from the Union of Employees of the National Judiciary (UEJN), supported by the General Confederation of Labour of the Argentine Republic (CGT RA), and in subsequent communications from the UEJN dated  June ,  April  and  June .
.The Government sent its replies in communications dated  July and  September ,  March , May  and  June , as well as two communications dated October.
.Since similar issues are raised in the two complaints, Cases Nos  and  will be examined together by the Committee.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  June , the UEJN and the CGT RA allege, at the outset, that the Argentine Government is using internal regulatory instruments to restrict judicial workers?exercise of the right to bargain collectively regarding their working conditions. The organizations report that in order to remedy this situation, draft legislation was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies with a view to the establishment of a uniform collective bargaining regime for the judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the  Argentine provinces. They state that it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies and that although the relevant Senate committees issued a favourable opinion on it and it was placed on the Senates agenda on three occasions, it was never considered and, as a consequence, the draft legislation expired pursuant to Act No. .
.The complainants add that judicial workers do not fall within the scope of Act No. , which regulates the right to bargain collectively in the public sector. They consider that not only does the absence of national legislation guaranteeing the right of employees of the national judiciary to bargain collectively and regulating the exercise of that right affect the interests and working conditions of those employees; it also has an impact on and serves as a deterrent to collective bargaining by judicial workers in all of the provincial jurisdictions since, notwithstanding the countrys federal system, the provinces adopt laws and mechanisms through which they agree to be bound by domestic law. The complainants also allege that the Argentine Government cannot invoke the separation of powers under the national Constitution as grounds for not adopting legislation that would grant judicial workers the right to bargain collectively since, in , the Government introduced and Congress adopted Act No.  regulating the hiring of all public servants and other employees of the judiciary and the national public prosecution services.
.In a communication sent in , drawing attention to Case No. , in which the Committee on Freedom of Association recommended that the Argentine Government should take measures adapted to national conditions, including legislative measures if necessary, to promote collective bargaining between judiciary authorities and the trade union organizations concerned? and the similar observations of the Committee of Expert on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with regard to the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the complainants add that by failing to adopt legislation on the right of judicial workers to bargain collectively, the Argentine Government has not followed any of the observations and recommendations of the International Labour Organization (ILO) supervisory bodies and that, despite the supervisory bodies?urging, there has been no progress whatsoever on the issue.
.The complainants further allege that the Argentine Government and the judicial authorities are interfering with the UEJN both at the national level and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. They maintain that: (i) the emergence of the Union of Judicial Workers of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (SITRAJUCABA), a pseudo-union, has led to the unlawful diversion of , members of the UEJN; (ii) Ms Vanesa Raquel Siley, General Secretary of SITRAJUCABA, has links with the political party in power at the time of the events in question; (iii) both at the national level and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the UEJN has been subjected to threats and persecution by the Attorney-General, MsAlejandra Gil Carbn, and the President of the Council of the Judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Mr Juan Manuel Olmos; (iv) this persecution worsened after  February , when the UEJN held a demonstration in front of the law courts and demanded additional information on the death of a prosecutor, Mr Alberto Nisman, who had been murdered a month earlier; (v) with the collusion of the President of the Council of the Judiciary, the pseudo-union misappropriated information on the UEJNs members and erased the hard drives of the computers in the latters offices; and (vi) the aforementioned events occurred at a time when the countrys then Minister of Labour, Employment and Social Security, Mr Carlos A. Tomada, who had links with the political party, Frente para la Victoria (Onward to Victory), was encouraging the emergence of yellow trade unions? having subjected the unions that did not share the official ideology to years of procedural delays while facilitating the registration process for other unions; in that regard, the complainants state that the Union of Judicial Workers (SITRAJU) and SITRAJUCABA were registered on  April  (Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security decisions Nos / and /), just four days after the registration process began. Lastly, the complainants accuse the Government and the judicial authorities of providing direct and indirect support to SITRAJU and SITRAJUCABA.
.In its communication of  April , the UEJN alleges, first, that the Council of the Judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CMCABA), hereinafter the local judicial body? arbitrarily excluded it from collective bargaining in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires even though it had signed a compromise agreement, agreeing to bargain collectively with the UEJN, on  December . The complainant maintains that the judicial body excluded it from the collective bargaining process in violation of its trade union rights and, on  November , signed a collective labour agreement with the Association of Employees of the Judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (AEJBA), a trade association that is registered only at the local level, and SITRAJUCABA, against which the complainant states that it has filed several criminal complaints and whose trade union status has been challenged in the courts. The complainant also recalls its allegation that there is no regulation of collective bargaining in any of the geographical areas over which the judiciary has jurisdiction and adds that, to date, there has been no collective bargaining in the sector as required by national legislation. The complainant also reports that the judicial body has conducted de facto?collective bargaining with trade union entities that, under Argentine law, were not authorized to bargain because they did not have the required trade union status (personera gremial).
.In a subsequent communication, the complainant mentions a meeting between CMCABA, AEJBA and SINTRAJOCABA, which was held on  April  in order to negotiate the wages and working conditions of judicial workers and to make any necessary changes in the current collective agreement. The complainant states that on the date in question, it arrived prepared to negotiate and was denied entry to the premises on the sole pretext that it was not empowered to bargain collectively. Lastly, the complainant maintains that it has exhausted domestic remedies in so far as it has made unsuccessful requests for cancellation of the registration of SITRAJUCABA and of the collective agreement.
.The UEJN further alleges that the local judicial body has committed acts of trade union interference, giving preferential treatment to SITRAJUCABA and AEJBA. It states that: (i)pursuant to the collective agreement, these two unions were subsidized through contributions from the employer amounting to . per cent of the total wages paid to employees of the judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires in order to defray the costs of their trade union activities; (ii) the President of the Council of the Judiciary, in decision No. /, ordered the employer to pay a supplement amounting to ,  and  per cent, respectively, of the wages of Mr Jos Alberto Olmos and Mr Adrin Javier Pafunto, (representing SINTRAJU) and Mr Carlos Daniel Daz (representing AEJBA) in order to establish the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Labour Policy and Labour Relations under the collective labour agreement; (iii) the associations that signed the collective labour agreement, but not the complainant, were granted private offices in buildings belonging to the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; and (iv) each of the signatory entities?trade union representatives were granted ten hours of paid trade union leave per month; in an act of discrimination, the UEJN was not granted such leave.
.In a communication received on  August , the Government indicates that by virtue of the separation of powers in the republican system enshrined in the Constitution, it has forwarded",0,2016,Argentina
47,"the complainants allegations regarding barriers to collective bargaining in the national judiciary to the Supreme Court. In a second communication dated  March , the Government forwards the Supreme Courts statement that it will not rule on this case. In a communication of May , the Government reiterates that, owing to the countrys republican and federal regime and pursuant to the Constitution, each provincial government may regulate the separation of powers and the competencies of each of those powers in accordance with its own constitution? The Government also mentions sections ,  and  of the federal Constitution, which states that the provinces shall retain all powers not delegated to the Federal Government by this Constitution or expressly reserved by special agreement at the time of their incorporation?and that the provinces are governed by their own local institutions; they elect governors, legislators and other provincial officials without interference from the Federal Government. The Government further states that the country has  provincial states and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and that each of them has been adopting its own legislation for years in light of its specific characteristics and conditions. On this point, the Government refers to the Committee on Freedom of Associations Case No. , in which the Association of Judicial Officers of Mendoza (AFJM) alleged that the Government of Mendoza province had failed to comply with the relevant Convention and the complainant dropped the complaint after signing a sectoral collective agreement with the provincial government. Lastly, the Government maintains that active wage negotiations have resulted in progress in the judiciaries of the various provinces. In its most recent communication (of October ), the Government states that Autarchic Act No. , which regulates the functioning of the judiciary, strengthens the latters independence; it reiterates that wage negotiations with the judiciary are ongoing in many provinces. In that connection, the Government mentions that: (i) there is already collective bargaining with the judiciary in Ro Negro and Santa Cruz provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, all three of which have adopted legislation regulating it; (ii) Santiago del Estero province reports that bargaining with the judiciary is being conducted at a round table with the relevant social stakeholders; and (iii) Neuqun and Crdoba provinces report that they have procedures for voluntary bargaining in the judiciary and that all relevant social stakeholders are notified in such cases.
.In a communication dated  June , the Government forwards the local judicial bodys response to the UEJNs allegations regarding the negotiation of a collective agreement within the Buenos Aires judiciary and interference in favour of other trade unions. With regard to these allegations, the local judicial body categorically denies having discriminated against the UEJN by excluding it from collective bargaining, failing to follow the recommendations of ILO supervisory bodies, interfering with the exercise of trade union rights, showing favouritism to other trade unions and conducting de facto?collective bargaining with trade union entities that did not have the required trade union status (personera gremial). It states that it is only competent to comment on the situation of the local judiciary since section  of the federal Constitution establishes that the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires shall have a system of autonomous government with its own legislative and judicial powers. It maintains that for this reason, the complainants complaint that judicial workers are unable to bargain collectively at the national level is irrelevant because a collective labour agreement was recently signed at the local level.
.Concerning the exclusion of the UEJN from collective bargaining, the local judicial body points out that the collective labour agreement was the outcome of joint efforts by itself and the trade unions and that the scope of the agreement includes all workers, regardless of whether they belong to a specific trade union. With respect to the agreement signed on December , the local judicial body explains that it was envisaged that, in addition to the employer, the signatories would be the two most representative trade union entities ?which were, at that time, the UEJN and the AEJBA ?since the statistics provided by the legal secretary in the Department of Human Resources showed that they had  and  members, respectively. However, by the time the collective labour agreement was signed on  November , the UEJN had become less representative than SITRAJUCABA, which had been entered in the Registry of Trade Unions of Workers in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires on  April . Thus, when the collective labour agreement was signed in , the signatories were the AEJBA and SITRAJU, which, again according to data provided by the Department of Human Resources, had , and , members, respectively. The UEJN was excluded from the bargaining because it had  members (. per cent of all trade union members). The local judicial entity also indicates that, according to information contained in Department of Human Resources memorandum No. of  February , the delegates who had represented the UEJN at the signing of the compromise agreement on  December  had changed unions and were members of SINTRAJU when the collective agreement was signed.
.The local judicial body states that in calling the AEJBA a trade association that is registered only at the local level?and SITRAJUCABA a pseudo-union? the UEJN is attempting to limit the participation of other labour groups, the coexistence of trade unions and the formation of new ones even though the complainant has always functioned locally as a sectional trade union and has not even been registered at the local level. It also states that it was the Committee on Freedom of Association that drew the Governments attention to the elimination of distinctions between trade unions and that, by making such a distinction, the complainant violated the principles established by the Committee. It adds that it has always maintained an ongoing dialogue with all trade union groups, regardless of their registration status.
.The local judicial body states that the ILO supervisory bodies have always considered that recognition of the most representative trade union does not violate the principles of freedom of association, provided that certain objective requirements are met and that the advantages are limited to the granting of certain preferential rights. It also explains that the fact that the AEJBA, SITRAJUCABA and the UEJN participate at the local level demonstrates respect for the principles of freedom of association and the promotion of trade union pluralism in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. It explains that, given that two of the local judiciarys trade unions are registered only at the local level and that only the complainant has trade union status at the national ?though not the local ?level, priority was given to the most representative unions during the bargaining in question. It states that although section  of the Trade Unions Act (Act No. ) authorizes the withholding of dues from wages only in the case of unions with trade union status, not those that are registered only at the local level, it withholds dues for all three of the trade unions that operate at the local level. Furthermore, although sections  and  of the Act provide that only individuals with trade union status shall enjoy trade union immunity, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires has decided to accord favourable treatment at the local level to all trade union representatives in order to avoid discriminating against any of them.
.The local judicial body explains that between December  and the date on which the collective labour agreement was signed, for reasons totally unrelated to the agreement, a new trade union entity ?which, in many workers?view, better represented them ?was established. Thus, the local judicial body acted correctly by taking note of the number of members reported by the trade unions in a timely manner and ensuring that workers and their associations enjoyed freedom of association; the fact that it bargained collectively with entities that were registered only at the local level or did not have trade union status does not constitute a violation of the right to freedom of association.
.As for the contribution made pursuant to an agreement, the local judicial body indicates that this contribution is not a subsidy, but rather an input pursuant to section  of the Trade Unions Act; its purpose is not to defray the costs of trade union activity but, as provided in section  of the collective labour agreement, to fund cultural and social activities and support planned new vocational training that will be available to the entire judicial community, regardless of trade union membership or lack thereof.
.With regard to the supplements paid to members of the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Labour Policy and Labour Relations under the collective labour agreement, the local judicial body indicates that the Committees establishment is envisaged in section(i) of the Basic Legal Regime Governing Judges, Public Servants and other Employees of the Judiciary, adopted through Council of Ministers decision No. /, which empowers the Council of the Judiciary to grant specific",0,2016,Argentina
48,"wage supplements on duly substantiated grounds at a percentage rate specified in the documents establishing the Standing Committee. In that connection, Presidential decision No. / authorized the establishment of a supplement for the Standing Committees coordinators in light of their additional responsibilities and the novelty of implementation of the first collective agreement. The local judicial body also mentions section  of that agreement, which calls for the establishment of the Standing Committee and sets out its functions.
.The local judicial body further states that, contrary to the complainants claims, the trade unions?noticeboards and offices are not for the exclusive use of SITRAJUCABA and the AEJBA; section  of the collective labour agreement does not specify their physical location, merely stating that they will be provided if the employer is able to do so. It adds that to date, there are no specific offices devoted to trade union activities, nor has the complainant requested such an office. Concerning the ten hours?leave per month that is granted to each of the signatory trade unions?officials, the local judicial body states that the time granted is proportionate to the representativeness of each union.
.With respect to the complainants?allegations of interference, the local judicial body states that it had nothing to do with the formation, operations or administration of any trade union; it adds that allowing the most representative unions to participate in no way implies State interference. It goes on to say that in order for an action to constitute interference with the exercise of trade union rights, there must be a clear intention to place these unions under the control of an employer or an employers?organization and that there is no evidence whatsoever of such an intention or of favouritism towards a given trade union, particularly as the complainant has supplied no evidence in that regard. In light of the foregoing, the local judicial body maintains that the complaint is factually and legally groundless; that the collective labour agreement is the outcome of a difficult effort by the employer and the signatory trade unions and benefits all employees of the local judiciary, including UEJN members; that the reported actions do not constitute violations of trade union rights; and that the complaint should therefore be dismissed.
.In its communication of  October , the Government forwards an additional response from the local judicial body. At the outset, the latter reiterates its previous observations and, in particular, its denial that the UEJN is registered in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and that there has been any attempt to eliminate it. It goes on to deny that it denied the UEJNentry to the meeting held by the CMCABA, the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA on April .
.The Committee observes that both Case No.  and Case No.  concern, on the one hand, allegations of violation of the right to bargain collectively in the judicial sector and, on the other, allegations of favouritism and interference to the detriment of the UEJN. The Committee notes that some of these allegations concern the status of the administration of justice at the national level while others are limited to the administration of justice in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.
.First, with regard to the allegation that the persistent absence of legislation recognizing and regulating the right of judicial workers throughout the country to bargain collectively prevents the workers in question from exercising that right, the Committee takes note of the complainants?statement that: (i) the Chamber of Deputies adopted draft legislation regulating collective bargaining uniformly for all of the countrys judicial workers; (ii)however, although all of its relevant committees had issued a favourable opinion on it, the Senate decided not to consider this draft; and (iii) not only does the absence of national legislation guaranteeing the right of employees of the national judiciary to bargain collectively and regulating the exercise of that right affect the interests and working conditions of those employees, it also has an impact on and serves as a deterrent to collective bargaining by judicial workers in all of the provincial jurisdictions since, notwithstanding the countrys federal system, the provinces adopt laws and mechanisms through which they agree to be bound by domestic law. The Committee also takes note of the Governments statement that: (i) under the Argentine institutional model, the provinces retain all powers not delegated to the Federal Government under the Constitution; (ii) the  provincial states and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires have been adopting their own legislation for years in light of their specific characteristics and conditions; and (iii) active wage negotiations with the judiciary are taking place in a growing number of provinces as evidenced by the collective agreements signed in Mendoza, Ro Negro and Santa Cruz provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the negotiations conducted in Santiago del Estero, Neuqun and Crdoba provinces.
.The Committee takes note of this information and emphasizes that although it is not for it to comment on the division of legislative powers among the various levels of government, it is competent to ascertain whether the current regulatory framework or lack thereof is hindering access to or exercise of the right to bargain collectively. In that regard, in a previous case concerning Argentina, the Committee recalled that while in the preparatory work for Convention No. , it was established that judges of the judiciary do not fall within the scope of implementation of the Convention; nevertheless, the said Convention does not exclude the auxiliary staff of judges. Also, according to Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, only armed forces and the police may be excluded from its scope. The Committee further recalled that while the same Article provides that while special modalities of the application of this Convention may be fixed, it deemed that auxiliary staff of the judiciary must have the right to collective bargaining. It therefore requested the Government to take measures adapted to national conditions, including legislative measures if necessary, to promote collective bargaining between the judiciary and the trade union organizations concerned [see Case No. , th Report, para. ]. While taking due note of the significant progress in collective bargaining in the judiciaries of a growing number of provinces and the fact that in several cases, this progress has followed the adoption of provincial legislation in that regard, the Committee notes that there is still no collective bargaining either in the majority of the countrys provincial judiciaries or in the national judiciary. It also notes that this absence of collective bargaining is still accompanied by the absence of a regulatory framework for collective bargaining in the sector in the various geographical regions. In that connection, the Committee reaffirms that its recommendations in Case No.  remain fully valid.
.Second, with regard to the alleged exclusion of the complainant from the first instance of collective bargaining in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the Committee takes note of the complainants statement that: (i) on  December , the local judicial body signed an agreement in which it undertook to bargain collectively with the complainant and the AEJBA; (ii) on  November , in violation of that agreement, the local judicial body signed a general collective labour agreement with the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA, two trade union entities without trade union status (personera gremial); and (iii) on  April , a meeting between the local judicial body, the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA was held in order to negotiate the wages and working conditions of the workers in question ?and that the complainant was denied entry on the grounds that it was not empowered to bargain collectively.
.The Committee also takes note of the local judicial bodys reply, which the Government forwarded, in which it denies that it discriminated against the complainant by excluding it and states that: (i) in the agreement of  December , it was envisaged that the signatories on the workers?behalf would be the two most representative trade unions in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; (ii) when the agreement of  December  was signed, the two most representative entities were the complainant and the AEJBA but by  November , when the collective labour agreement was signed, the complainant had lost that position and, as a consequence, the agreement was signed by the two trade unions that were the most representative at that time, the AEJBA and SINTRAJUCABA; (iii) the complainant is seeking to limit the participation of other trade union groups even though it functions locally as a sectional trade union; it is not and never has been registered at the local level; (iv) the local judicial body has always promoted trade union pluralism and since the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA are registered only at the local level and the complainant has trade union status only at the national level, it gave priority to the two trade union organizations that were most representative in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; and (v) it did not deny the UEJN entry to the meeting",-1,2016,Argentina
49,"held by the CMCABA, the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA on  April .
.In light of the foregoing, the Committee observes that the second allegation concerns the local judicial bodys decision to exclude the complainant from the negotiation and signing of its first collective agreement in favour of two other trade unions that the employer considered more representative at the time even though, the previous year, it had signed with the complainant an agreement stipulating that it would negotiate the collective agreement with the two most representative trade unions, namely the UEJN and the AEJBA?
.On this point, the Committee draws attention to the following background information: (i)at the time of the events, none of the trade unions had trade union status in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Bueno Aires, which, under Argentine general law and provincial ActNo. / ?which is applicable to this specific case ?is a condition for the entitlement to bargain collectively; (ii) according to the local judicial body, during the year that elapsed between the signing of the initial agreement with the complainant and the signing of the collective agreement with other organizations, a new trade union (SITRAJUCABA) was formed and rapidly achieved a membership far higher than that of the complainant; and (iii) the judicial bodys reply shows that the number of members of each of its three trade unions was calculated by its own Department of Human Resources.
.With regard to determination of the trade unions that are entitled to bargain collectively, the Committee recalls that where, under the system in force, the most representative union enjoys preferential or exclusive bargaining rights, decisions concerning the most representative organization should be made by virtue of objective and pre-established criteria so as to avoid any opportunities for partiality or abuse [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para.]. In this case, the Committee observes that in the absence of trade unions with trade union status, the local judicial body had no pre-established rules for identifying the most representative trade unions with which to negotiate collectively the collective agreement for the sector. The Committee also recalls that the determination to ascertain or verify the representative character of trade unions can best be ensured when strong guarantees of secrecy and impartiality are offered. Thus, verification of the representative character of a union should a priori be carried out by an independent and impartial body [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. While the Committee welcomes the signing of the first collective agreement in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, it requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future, identification of the representative trade unions with a view to negotiation of the collective agreement in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires is based on objective and pre-established criteria. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.
.The Committee takes note of the complainants?third allegation regarding several acts of interference in which the local judicial body is said to have given preference to the signatories of the collective agreement. In that connection, the complainant maintains that: (i) the two signatories were subsidized through contributions from the employer amounting to . per cent of the total wages paid to employees of the judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; (ii) by a decision of the President of the Council of the Judiciary, the employer was ordered to pay a supplement amounting to a percentage of the wages of the members of the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Labour Policy and Labour Relations, which is composed entirely of members of the signatory organizations; (iii) these organizations were granted private offices in buildings belonging to the judiciary; and (iv)each of the signatory entities?trade union representatives were granted ten hours of paid trade union leave per month.
.The Committee also takes note of the local judicial bodys reply, which the Government forwarded, in which the judicial body indicates that: (i) the so-called contribution pursuant to an agreement that the complainant mentions is an input pursuant to section  of the Trade Unions Act and its purpose is to fund cultural and social activities and support training plans that will benefit all staff members; (ii) the supplement paid to members of the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Labour Policy and Labour Relations is envisaged in section  of the Basic Legal Regime Governing Judges, Public Servants and other Employees of the Judiciary, adopted through Council of Ministers decision No. /, in Presidential decision No. /, and in section  of the collective labour agreement; (iii) the trade unions?offices and noticeboards are not for the exclusive use of the signatories since section  of the collective labour agreement does not specify their physical location, merely stating that they will be provided if the employer is able to do so, and the complainant has not requested them; and (iv) concerning the ten hours of paid leave, the time granted is proportionate to the representativeness of each group.
.With regard to the complaint regarding the advantages granted to two trade unions, the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA, the Committee observes that these advantages arose from implementation of the collective agreement and from the fact that the signatory organizations are the most representative. The Committee refers to its previous conclusions regarding the need to ensure that in future, the verification of most representative trade union?status with a view to negotiation of the collective agreement in the judiciary is carried out by a body independent of the parties involved.
.The Committee takes note of the complainants?final allegation: that the formation of the trade union, SINTRAJU, and its subsidiary, SITRAJUCABA, in  was accompanied by favouritism by the then Minister of Labour and the then judiciary and by interference and persecution directed against the UEJN, including, among other things: (i) registration of SITRAJU by the Ministry of Labour in just four days; (ii) seizure of the data on the UEJNs hard drives; and (iii) unlawful diversion of , members of the UEJN by SITRAJU. While noting that the Government has sent no observations concerning these allegations, the Committee notes that they were presented quite briefly by the complainants, which did not provide details or evidence that would facilitate both the Governments response and the Committees examination. Under the circumstances, unless it receives additional details from the complainants, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to take measures adapted to national conditions, including legislative measures if necessary, to promote collective bargaining between judiciary authorities and the trade union organizations concerned and, in particular, to facilitate the adoption, in consultation with the various trade unions concerned, of the rules applicable to collective bargaining in this sector. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future, identification of the representative trade unions with a view to negotiation of the collective agreement in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires is based on objective and pre-established criteria. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.",-1,2016,Argentina
50,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) dated  November , and in a joint communication from the CTERA, the Union of Education Workers (UTE) and Education International (EI) dated  May .
.The Government of Argentina sent its observations in communications dated October, September ,  and  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  December , the CTERA alleges that resolution No. / issued in March  by the Provincial Government of Corrientes, Republic of Argentina, violates the freedom of association and the right to strike of the provinces education workers, who are members of the CTERA. The complainant states that, by means of this resolution, the Provincial Government of Corrientes informed the Single Union of Education Workers of Corrientes (SUTECO), which is the CTERAs primary union in the Province of Corrientes, that it cannot take direct action, as the subject of the dispute has become abstract in the light of the conclusion of the wage agreement?and that it is not entitled to represent the collective interests of educational staff? under penalty of investigatory proceedings and sanctions.
.The complainant refers below to the context in which the resolution was adopted and states that: (i) the Corrientes Association of the Provincial Teachers (ACDP), SUTECO and the Argentine Union of Private Teachers (SADOP) informed the Labour Directorate, the Undersecretariat of Labour for the province, of its decision to hold a -hour strike as of midnight on  February ; (ii) the collective dispute and strike are the result of the refusal by the provincial Ministry of Education to recognize the legitimacy of the teachers?wage claim; (iii) on  February , SUTECO notified that the strike would be extended by an additional  hours, thus lasting hours; (iv) faced with this situation, the Labour Directorate issued resolution No. / on  February , submitting the collective dispute to mandatory conciliation, regulated by National Law No. ./; (v)the Labour Directorate also stipulated through resolution No./ that the three unions, ACDP, SUTECO and SADOP, should refrain from holding a strike for the duration of the mandatory conciliation, scheduling the first hearing for February , but which never took place; (vi) however, the three unions held the strike on February ; (vii) with no legal basis, and based on the fact that the three unions had failed to comply with the decision to refrain from holding the strike, the Labour Directorate decided to terminate the mandatory conciliation and ordered the initiation of the investigatory proceedings required to issue fines for alleged obstruction? (viii)in this context, the provincial Ministry of Education of Corrientes summoned the five teachers?unions, including SUTECO, to the its headquarters where on  March , it eventually made a modest wage proposal, which was accepted by the unions with the exception of SUTECO; (ix) the wage agreement was concluded outside any legal regulation; (x)on  March , SUTECO called for another  hour strike on  March ; and (xi) the Labour Directorate incorporated into file No.   / in an irregular manner the wage agreement concluded with the other unions and on the basis of that agreement, issued the denounced resolution No. /, notifying SUTECO that it should refrain from holding the strike ?threatening it with sanctions ?for lacking legitimacy?to represent the collective interests of teachers, overlooking the fact that both the Labour Directorate and the provincial legislature had recognized its legitimacy.
.Moreover, the CTERA denounces the Provincial Governments malicious failure to regulate Provincial Law No.  of  regarding the collective agreement for teachers, thus rendering it inapplicable. The complainant specifically alleges that: (i) this situation becomes fundamentally important when measuring the limited legal effect of the agreement concluded between the representatives of the Provincial Government and the representatives of the four teachers?unions; (ii) the Labour Directorate of the Province of Corrientes did not take into account that the only agreements on working conditions that have erga omnes effect are those that are concluded under Law No.  of  regarding the collective agreement, once it is regulated; (iii) it is a serious error for the Labour Directorate to stipulate in article  of resolution No.  that SUTECO cannot take direct action (strike), as the subject of the dispute has become abstract in the light of the agreement concluded with the ACDP, the Argentine Teachers' Union (UDA), the Association of Technical Teachers (AMET) and the Teacher Unification Movement (MUD), since SUTECO has not signed the wage agreement and therefore its effects do not apply to its members or to teachers who are not members any union; (iv) resolution No. / is absolutely and irrevocably null and void, insofar as the Provincial Government disregards SUTECOs right to represent the collective interests of teachers at all levels of education by arguing that this right belongs to the ACDP because it is the only association with trade union status, on the basis of paragraphs , ,  and  of the recitals of resolution No. /; (v) this is a restrictive and arbitrary interpretation of articles  and  of Law No. . on trade union associations, which runs counter to article  bis of the National Constitution, and in particular to article  of Provincial Law No.  of , which recognizes the legitimacy of SUTECO to form part of future collective bargaining committees, on the basis of the future collective bargaining agreement for teachers at all levels; and (vi) the body that issued the contested Provision No. / is the employing party in the collective dispute with the teachers' unions, as the Labour Directorate depends on the provincial executive branch; thus, as a party to the collective dispute, it cannot intervene as a conciliatory party (objective and impartial), in accordance with the procedure regulated by the aforementioned Law No. ..
.The complainant then denounces resolution No. / issued by the Labour Directorate of the Province of Corrientes, which declared the strike action ordered by SUTECO for  October  illegal, which also shows how this body follows the political directives of the Provincial Government of Corrientes, which is party to the collective dispute. By establishing that SUTECO lacks the status to call a strike, the Labour Directorate disregards the fact that the provincial executive branch fined SUTECO for allegedly refusing to comply with a resolution of the Labour Directorate requiring it to undergo mandatory conciliation, in accordance with Law No. ., a procedure which only trade union associations with the right to declare strikes are obliged to undergo. The complainant requests that the Argentine Government be informed that the Province of Corrientes must annul resolutions Nos / and / and cancel the fine of , Argentine pesos for the February  strike.
.In a communication dated  May , the complainant (together with the UTE) alleges that: (i) the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires violated the principles guaranteeing freedom of association and the right to strike by issuing Decree No. / dated  April , in which it declared, inter alia, that the Ministry of Education of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the bodies within its ambit and the educational establishments under its authority or supervised by it constituted essential services during the COVID- pandemic, in order to disregard the right to strike of education workers in public schools, whether publicly and privately managed, that answer to the Ministry of Education of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, while also deducting wages from teachers for the days they did not work and went on strike; (ii) the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires threatened to apply sanctions to those who intended to take collective direct action (strike); (iii) designating educational establishments to be of an essential nature? by means of the aforementioned decree, was part of a policy of persecution that, in recent years, the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires has implemented against the workers of educational establishments; (iv) the decree issued by a local authority, like the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, declaring the ""essential nature"" of educational establishments, is clearly unconstitutional, not only because that jurisdiction lacked the competence to establish the essential nature of education, but mainly because it directly affected the exercise of basic constitutional rights, to the detriment of education workers, such as the right to strike established in article  bis of the National Constitution; (v) education does not constitute an essential service if we take into account the provisions of article  of Law No. . on disputes in essential services, the relevant part of which provides that: ?.. Health and hospital services, the production and distribution of drinking water, electricity and gas and air traffic control shall be considered essential services.",5,2015,Argentina
51,"An activity not included in the preceding paragraph may exceptionally be designated an essential service, by an independent committee established in accordance with regulation...?[...] The national executive branch, with the intervention of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and following consultation with the employers?and workers?organizations, shall issue the regulation referred to in this article within ninety () days, in accordance with the principles of the International Labour Organization? (vi) moreover, education could not be considered an essential service under the principles established by the International Labour Organization, as set forth in the Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association; (vii) pursuant to Decree No. / dated  March , regulating the Guarantees Committee provided for in article  of the aforementioned Law No. ., an activity not included in the above-mentioned list may exceptionally be designated an essential service if a conciliation procedure has already initiated; (viii) any resolution or decree that designates a service to be essential?without complying with the legislation in force and international labour principles is null and void; (ix) resolution No. / issued by the Ministry of Labour in , declaring education to be an essential service? had already been declared null and void by the Supreme Court of Justice (and led to the decision of the Committee on Freedom of Association in Case No. ); (x) at the date of drafting the present communication (May ), the Decree of Necessity and Urgency No. / dated  May , issued by the national executive branch, was in force, requiring the continuation of online classes and the prohibition of in-person classes in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires as a result of the high number of COVID- cases, as was resolution No. / dated  May , issued by the Federal Education Council, ordering the suspension of in-person classes in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires until  May ; (xi) the real reason the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires declared educational establishments to be of an essential nature?was that it did not wish to implement the aforementioned emergency decree of the national executive branch (making mandatory online classes) so that it could impose its decision to resume in-person classes, which it had used as an electoral and political pledge; (xii) as a result, following the UTEs strike to uphold Decree No. / (making online classes mandatory) so as to prevent COVID- from further spreading in schools, the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires deducted wages from education workers, in an act of retaliation against those who merely sought compliance with a higher-ranking norm during a serious health crisis; and (xiii) the surreptitious designation of education as an essential service by means of Decree No. / of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the deduction of wages and the threats of disciplinary sanctions for the strikes called by the UTE directly prevented the right to strike from being exercised, and such acts clearly violate the decisions of the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In a communication dated October , the Government provides its observations on the complainants allegations concerning the public education sector in the Province of Corrientes. The Government states, first, that SUTECO is and continues to be recognized by the various government bodies and actively participates with the other unions operating in the Province of Corrientes. There is thus no discrimination against this union, as demonstrated by its participation in the resolution dated March  (which later became a joint agreement in which the other trade union organizations accepted the wage increase). Likewise, SUTECO was involved in the regulation of the law on collective bargaining, as evidenced by the copy of the resolution dated  June , which confirms that the discrimination alleged by the complainant does not exist. The Government adds that: (i) in the midst of the bargaining process, SUTECO did not comply with the mandatory conciliation process and resorted to a strike, which is why it was expelled from the collective bargaining table; (ii) according to information provided by the Undersecretariat of Labour for the Province of Corrientes, the collective dispute was, at the date of this communication (October ), in a judicial process and, therefore, it is proposed that the Committee wait for the resolution of that process before taking a decision; and (iii)the complainant did not provide any evidence to support its statements, making it impossible to corroborate the veracity of its arguments.
.In a communication dated September , the Government states that the Undersecretary of Labour for the Province of Corrientes indicated that the collective dispute was still being processed at the judicial level, without any definitive developments in the case at the date of the communication (September ). Furthermore, the Government indicates once again that the complainant did not provide any evidence to support its allegations, making it impossible to corroborate whether they are duly founded.
.In a communication dated  September , the Government states that: (i) the judicial process related to the collective dispute disclosed in the case Single Union of Education Workers Corrientes v. Provincial Government of Corrientes re. Administrative Action? file No./, has already concluded by means of rulings issued by the Administrative Court of First Instance No.  (of the Province of Corrientes) and the Administrative and Electoral Court of Appeals, as has the special judicial review before the Supreme Court of Justice; (ii) the case was initiated by SUTECO with the aim of having Decree No. / declared null and void, as it rejected the hierarchical appeal filed by SUTECO against resolution No. / of the Labour Directorate, which had rejected the hierarchical appeal filed by SUTECO against resolution No./, which had imposed a fine for non-compliance with resolution No. / (which had, inter alia, prohibited the strike from being held for the duration of the mandatory conciliation). Thus, SUTECO alleged in the judicial proceedings that there was a procedural irregularity and that, from the issuance of resolution No. / by the Labour Directorate to the conclusion of the procedure, it had to comply with the provisions of Law No. . concerning collective dispute procedure and not with the provisions of articles  to  of Law No. . (procedure for labour law infractions). On  July , the Court of First Instance rejected SUTECO's claim by ruling that the complainant had failed to prove the illegitimacy of Decree No. / or the acts that had preceded it, since no visible irregularities in its essential elements had emerged or been proven, nor were there any convincing indications of the illegality alleged by the complainant; (iii) however, this decision was reversed by decision of the Court of Appeals, in February , when it declared that the application of article  of Law No. . to the case was unconstitutional and thus decreed that Decree No. /, challenged by the appellant SUTECO, was null and void and ordered the provincial executive branch to issue a new administrative act analysing the legality of the fine ordered in resolution No. /; (iv) although the Provincial Government of Corrientes filed a special judicial review before the provincial Supreme Court of Justice, it was declared inadmissible in a ruling dated December ; (v) this ruling concluded the judicial proceedings initiated by SUTECO against the Provincial Government of Corrientes to challenge the administrative acts issued in the context of the mandatory conciliation process and which, according to the complainant, would have interfered with the exercise of the right to freedom of association and the right to strike; (vi) although the legal action initiated by SUTECO had a favourable ruling, it is also true that the merits of the claim are not based on the arguments put forward by SUTECO (that the alleged irregularities of the contested administrative acts violate freedom of association), as it had alleged irregularities of competence, cause and procedure in the administrative acts issued in the context of the mandatory conciliation, which were also invoked when filing the present complaint before the Committee on Freedom of Association; (vii) however, the Court of Appeals decreed Decree No. / null and void as a logical consequence of having decreed that the application of article  of Law No. . was unconstitutional, considering that the requirement of prior payment established in that article solve et repete, as a condition for the admission of the hierarchical appeal filed by SUTECO against the penalizing provision issued by the Labour Directorate, violated the constitutional right of defence; (viii) it should be noted that the fact that Decree No. / was declared null and void by the judiciary of Corrientes did not put an end to the administrative process in which the resolutions were issued by the Labour Directorate, which were challenged by SUTECO and which form the basis for the filing of the present complaint before the Committee, as the Court of Appeals ordered the defendant to issue a new administrative act analysing the legality of the fine ordered in resolution No. /? and",3,2015,Argentina
52,"(ix) therefore, the correct interpretation of the ruling of the Court of Appeals is that the administrative actions challenged by SUTECO should date back to the instance prior to the issuance of Decree No. / (declared null and void), and the provincial executive branch should reanalyse the hierarchical appeal filed against resolution No. /, in which the Labour Directorate fined the union.
.In a communication dated  September , the Government forwarded the observations of the Autonomous Government of the City of Buenos Aires on the allegations sent in May  by CETERA, UTE and EI. The Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires underlines that the allegations of the complainant organisations that Decree No. / violates the right to strike lack any factual and normative precision. The Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires first refers to the context in which the Decree was adopted and states in this respect that: (i) the declaration of the essential nature of the activities carried out by the agents of the Ministry of Education of the City was adopted at a time when the health situation (reduction in the number of cases, vaccination schedule) caused by the COVID- pandemic made it possible to relax the isolation measures and return to the development of activities as normal; (ii) the aforementioned declaration of essentiality stems from the existence, recognized by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, of a human right to education that must be satisfied to the greatest extent possible; and (iii) although the remote education modalities produced a significant participation of students, they did not replace the benefits of face-to-face education in the learning process and in the socialisation of the children.
.The Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires then refers to the alleged impact of Decree No. / on the right to strike. It states in this regard that: (i) the essential nature of educational activity established by the above-mentioned decree was different from the mechanism established by article  of Law ., which allows for the exceptional classification of certain activities as essential services with a view to establishing minimum services in the event of a strike; (ii) on the contrary, trade union organizations in general and the complainants in particular were at all times granted the right to take industrial action; (iii)in fact, industrial actions were carried out during the periods when Decree No. / was in force; (iv) the exercise of the right to strike entails the suspension of workers' activities on the one hand and the non-payment of the corresponding wages on the other hand; and v) the fact that striking workers in the education sector did not receive wages for the days not worked constitutes evidence of the operability of the right to strike during the term of Decree No./.
.The Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires finally submits that the factual and legal situation has changed radically since the adoption of the above-mentioned decree, which is why it considers that the complainants' allegations have become abstract.
.The Committee notes that the present case concerns the alleged violation of freedom of association in the public education sector in the Province of Corrientes and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.
.In relation to the aspects of the complaint regarding the Province of Corrientes, the Committee notes that the CTERA alleges that, since February , the provincial authorities have disregarded the right of SUTECO (the CTERA's primary union in the education sector in the Province of Corrientes) to bargain collectively and to strike, in contradiction with the provisions of both national and international regulations and Provincial Law No.  of  on collective bargaining in the public education sector. The Committee notes that the CTERA specifically states that: (i) during difficult wage negotiations between the provincial authorities and five unions in the public education sector in early , SUTECO and two other unions communicated their intention to hold a strike on February ; (ii) in accordance with National Law No. ./, the provincial Labour Directorate decided to submit the collective dispute to mandatory conciliation, ordering the three unions to refrain from holding the strike until the conciliation process had ended (resolution No./); arguing that the unions had not refrained from holding the aforementioned strike, the Labour Directorate unjustifiably terminated the conciliation and initiated proceedings to fine the three organizations; (iv) outside any legal regulation, the provincial Ministry of Education met with the five unions and proposed a modest wage increase that was accepted by four unions, but rejected by SUTECO; (v) in view of SUTECOs call for a one-day strike on  March , the provincial Labour Directorate issued resolution No. /, which established that SUTECO could not take direct action (strike), as the subject of the collective dispute had become abstract as a result of the conclusion of a wage agreement with other trade union organizations, and that SUTECO was not entitled to represent the collective interests of educational staff; and (vi) disregard for SUTECO's prerogatives was confirmed by resolution No. /, issued by the Labour Directorate of the Province of Corrientes, which declared the strike ordered by SUTECO for  October  illegal. The Committee notes that the complainant considers that: (i) the prohibition on strike action contained in resolution No. /, based on the fact that a collective bargaining agreement had just been concluded, is unfounded, as SUTECO had not signed the agreement in question; (ii) the denial in the same resolution of SUTECO's capacity to collectively represent the teachers of the province runs counter to the provisions of Provincial Law No. ; and (iii) the various decisions of the provincial authorities described above are also irregular insofar as the provincial administration assumes the role of judge in collective disputes to which it is a direct party. The Committee notes that the complainant concludes that the aforementioned decisions should be annulled, including the fine of , pesos for the February  strike.
.The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government states that: (i) there is no discrimination on the part of the provincial authorities of Corrientes against SUTECO, as evidenced by its inclusion in the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the collective bargaining agreement of March , as well as in discussions in June  regarding the regulation of Provincial Law No. ; (ii) in the midst of the bargaining process, SUTECO did not comply with the mandatory conciliation process and resorted to a strike, even though Provision No. / had ordered it to refrain from doing so, which is why it was expelled from the collective bargaining table; (iii) this collective dispute gave rise to legal action regarding the legality of the fine imposed against SUTECO for holding the February  strike in violation of resolution No. /; and (iv) in decisions dated February  and December , the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Justice of the province declared, on formal grounds, the provincial authorities' actions to be null and void and ordered the provincial executive branch to issue a new administrative act analysing the legality of the fine ordered. The Committee notes that the Government states in this respect that SUTECO's legal action and the corresponding court decisions were not based on the violations of freedom of association alleged in the present case, but on the consideration that the requirement of prior payment of the fine, as a condition for the admission of the hierarchical appeal filed by SUTECO against the penalizing provision issued by the Directorate of Labour, violated the constitutional right of defence.
.The Committee takes due note of the information provided by the parties concerning the dispute between SUTECO and the authorities of the Province of Corrientes in the context of the negotiation of public teachers' wages. The Committee notes that the complainant denounces both specific decisions of the provincial administration in this regard (in particular resolutions Nos / and /, resolution No. / and resolution No. /), which, according to the complainant, reflect more generally the intention to exclude SUTECO from collective labour relations, as well as the irregular nature of the intervention of the provincial executive branch, which would assume the role of judge and party in collective disputes in the public sector. The Committee notes that the dispute is taking place in a context of trade union pluralism in the education sector of the province where, according to the information provided by the parties, SUTECO has a simple registration, while the ACDP has trade union status (a type of registration reserved by Argentine law for the most representative organizations, which under national law have a monopoly on collective bargaining), while article  of Provincial Law No.  provides for collective bargaining status that is not limited to organizations with trade union status.
.With regard to the fine imposed against SUTECO by the provincial Labour Directorate (resolution No./) for holding a one-day strike in February  despite a decision from the Labour Directorate ordering it to refrain from striking (Decision No. /),",-1,2015,Argentina
53,"the Committee notes that the complainant and the Government agree that the strike held by SUTECO took place in the midst of a mandatory conciliation process ordered by the provincial Labour Directorate in accordance with National Law No. ./, and that the prohibition on strikes was aimed at ensuring the completion of the conciliation process. The Committee recalls in this regard that legislation which provides for voluntary conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before a strike may be called cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association, provided recourse to arbitration is not mandatory and does not, in practice, prevent the calling of the strike [Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee also emphasizes that in cases of mandatory conciliation, it is desirable to entrust the decision of opening the conciliation procedure in collective disputes to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute [Compilation, para. ]. Lastly, the Committee recalls that in previous cases, it expected that any fines that could be imposed against trade unions for unlawful strikes would not be of an amount that was likely to lead to the dissolution of the union or to have an intimidating effect on trade unions and inhibit their legitimate trade union activities, and trusted that the Government would endeavour to resolve such situations by means of frank and genuine social dialogue [Compilation, para. ]. Noting that the decisions relating to the imposition of the aforementioned fine were annulled by the courts for violation of the right of defence and that the file is once again before the provincial authorities, the Committee expects that they will take due account of the criteria set out above.
.With regard to the two additional prohibitions on SUTECO's recourse to strike action by means of resolutions Nos / and / adopted by the provincial Labour Directorate, the Committee notes that: (i) the CTERA alleges that the prohibition contained in resolution No. / of March  is illegal because it was based on the wage agreement signed by the other trade union organizations, but rejected by SUTECO, in order to claim that the collective dispute that led to the strike had been settled; and (ii) the CTERA alleges that in both cases, the provincial labour administration is judge and party, as it prohibited strikes in a collective dispute involving the provincial administration itself. At the same time, the Committee notes that: (i) it has not been provided with the text of the incriminated provisions, which are also not publicly available; (ii) it does not have the specific observations of the Government on this matter; (iii) it does not have any factual information on the strike planned by SUTECO in , which gave rise to resolution No. /. In the light of the above, the Committee does not have at its disposal the information that would allow it to comprehensively assess the validity of the grounds for prohibiting the strike movements put forward by SUTECO. The Committee does find, however, that in both cases the decisions to prohibit the strike, like the decision previously examined to impose mandatory conciliation, were taken by the provincial public administration and not by a body independent of the parties. In this regard, the Committee recalls once again that in cases of mandatory conciliation, it is desirable to entrust the decision of opening the conciliation procedure in collective disputes to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute and, moreover, that the responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the Government, but with an independent and impartial body [Compilation, paras  and ]. In the light of the above, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that decisions concerning recourse to mandatory conciliation and the prohibition of strike movements are taken by bodies independent of the parties. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee recalls additionally that the Government may avail itself of the technical assistance of the Office with respect to the requested measures.
.With respect to the CTERA's allegation that the provincial administration had not only prohibited SUTECO from striking in the context of the collective dispute in February-March , but also sought to deny it the right to collectively represent public teachers, the Committee notes that, on the one hand, the complainant states that: (i) resolution No. / implies that only ACDP, which enjoys trade union status, would be entitled to represent the province's teachers in collective bargaining processes, and (ii) the lack of regulation of Provincial Law No. , article  of which provides for the participation of all trade union organizations in the education sector at the bargaining table, illustrates the administration's desire to exclude SUTECO. The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government claims that there is no intention to exclude SUTECO, as evidenced by its participation in the wage agreement negotiations in  and in discussions in  on the regulation of Provincial Law No. . While recalling that systems based on a sole bargaining agent (the most representative) and those which include all organizations or the most representative organizations in accordance with clear pre-established criteria for the determination of the organizations entitled to bargain are both compatible with Convention No.  [Compilation, para. ], the Committee observes that the Government has not reported that the regulation of Provincial Law No.  has concluded. Emphasizing that, under Article (d) of Convention No.  ratified by Argentina, measures should be taken to ensure that collective bargaining is not hampered by the absence of rules governing the procedure to be used or by the inadequacy or inappropriateness of such rules, the Committee trusts that the necessary steps will be taken to ensure the full applicability of the laws governing collective bargaining in the Province of Corrientes, which provide for the participation of the various trade union organizations in the education sector in collective bargaining.
.The Committee further notes that, by means of a communication dated May , the CTERA, the UTE and EI allege undue restrictions on the right to strike by the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The Committee notes that the complainants state that Decree No. / dated April  declared that the Ministry of Education of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the bodies within its ambit and the educational establishments under its authority or supervised by it constituted essential services during the COVID- pandemic? thus disregarding the right to strike of education workers in educational establishments. The Committee notes that the complainants allege in particular that: (i) Decree No. / clearly runs counter to the national and international regulations in force; (ii) the Supreme Court of Justice had already declared resolution No. / null and void, which had been issued by the Ministry of Labour in , declaring education to be an essential service; (iii) the real reason the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires declared educational establishments to be of an essential nature was that it did not wish to comply with Decree No. / of the national executive branch, making online classes mandatory; and (iv) following the UTEs strike to uphold the aforementioned Decree No. / (making mandatory online classes) and thus prevent COVID- from further spreading in schools, the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires deducted wages from education workers, in an act of retaliation against those who sought compliance with a higher-ranking norm during a serious health crisis.
.The Committee also notes that the Government forwards the observations of the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, which considers that the allegations of the complainant organizations that Decree No. / violates the right to strike lack any factual and normative precision. The Committee notes in particular that the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires first states that: (i) the declaration of the essential nature of the activities carried out by the employees of the Ministry of Education of the City was adopted at a time when the health situation caused by the COVID- pandemic made it possible to return to normal activities; ii) the aforementioned declaration of essentiality stems from the existence, recognised by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, of a human right to education that must be satisfied to the greatest extent possible, and it should also be considered that the remote education modalities did not replace the benefits of face-to-face education in the learning process and in the socialisation of children. The Committee notes that the Government of the City of Buenos Aires states secondly that: (i) the essential nature of the educational activity established by the aforementioned decree was different from the mechanism established by article  of Law . , which allows the exceptional classification of certain activities as essential services with a view to establishing minimum services in the event of a strike; ii) on the contrary, the trade unions",3,2015,Argentina
54,"in general and the plaintiffs in particular were at all times recognised as having the right to take industrial action; iii) in fact, industrial action measures were taken during the periods when Decree No. / was in force; (iv) the exercise of the right to strike entails the suspension of workers' activities on the one hand and the non-payment of the corresponding wages on the other hand; and (v) the fact that striking workers in the education sector have not received wages for the days they did not work during the period of validity of Decree No. / is evidence of the operability of the right to strike in this context. The Committee notes that the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires finally affirms that the factual and legal situation has changed radically since the adoption of the above-mentioned decree, which is why it considers that the complainants' allegations have become abstract.
.The Committee takes due note that the reply provided by the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires indicates that: (i) the declaration of the essential nature of the education sector by Decree No. / was not intended to disregard the teachers' right to strike but to exempt that sector from the restrictions on activity imposed in the context of the pandemic; and (ii) strike action was in fact carried out in that sector in the City of Buenos Aires while the decree was in force without the legality of such action being questioned. In this respect, the Committee has taken note of judgement No.  of  August  handed down by Labour Court No.  (Asociacin Docente de Enseanza Media y Superior (ADEMYS)/ v. Gobierno de la Ciudad Autnoma de Buenos Aires). The Committee notes that this judgement was the result of legal action brought by a trade union organization to obtain payment for the strike days taken between April and June  in order to maintain the distance education system. While recalling that it has considered that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles [Compilation, para. ] and that the judgement in question has been the subject of an appeal that is still pending , the Committee notes that in the referred judgement: (i) the Court ruled in favour of ADEMYS, finding that the strike by the teachers of the City of Buenos Aires constituted a response to the employer's failure to comply with the national provisions which continued to impose distance education; and (ii) the City of Buenos Aires did not challenge the legality of the strike. Noting that it is clear from the above elements that Decree No. / did not have the effect of restricting the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee will not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the consequences of the strike held by SUTECO in February , the Committee expects that the competent authorities will take due account of the criteria set out in the present conclusions.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that decisions concerning recourse to mandatory conciliation and the prohibition of strike movements are taken by bodies independent of the parties. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) The Committee recalls that the Government may avail itself of the technical assistance of the Office with respect to the implementation of recommendation (b).",3,2015,Argentina
55,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of Judicial Officers of the Province of Mendoza (AFJM) dated  June . The AFJM submitted new allegations in a communication dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  June ,  September  and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the AFJM indicates that it obtained simple trade union registration in  and in  it obtained legal trade union status to represent all the graded staff of the Judicial Authority in the Province of Mendoza in all categories and judicial districts, from the Secretary of the Ministry (First Superior Officer) to the Secretary of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza, or equivalent posts, whether professionals or not, with an area of action in the Province of Mendoza. The complainant also notes that it is not a member of any second or third level organization.
.The complainant indicates that: (i) since /, the Government decision to open up collective bargaining in the public sector as a way to agree wages meant that the only existing trade union in the judicial sector, the Trade Union Association of the Employees of the Mendoza Judicial Authority (AGEPJ), became involved in that regard; (ii) as soon as it obtained legal recognition as a trade union in , the AFJM was invited to participate in collective bargaining in a unique and separate forum and held just two meetings to that effect; (iii) paradoxically, immediately afterwards, that forum transformed into one of plural representation, and it remains as such to date, and (iv) the fact that the representative trade union associations in the sector have diametrically opposed viewpoints but are contained within a single remunerative framework, fighting from different philosophical and political positions, for a whole range of criteria for dividing up the payroll, generates an inevitable conflict of interests, as a result of which it is advisable to recommend separating the sectors negotiating table; as a result the matter has not been and will not be resolved within the domestic jurisdiction of the Argentine Republic and thus turns to the Committee on Freedom of Association for its valued and definitive intervention.
.In its  communication, the complainant organization alleges that for two years the Government of Mendoza refused to sign wage agreements with it and that in  the Government agreed wages in the judicial sector with the AGEPJ, which does not represent the per cent of unionized officials required by Provincial Decree No. /, and which justifiably undermines its legal authority to agree officials?wages. The complainant alleges that it was excluded from the salary agreement in  capriciously and also states that it has fruitlessly pursued the opening of a forum for drafting the collective agreement for judicial officials/graded staff for two years.
.In its communication dated  May , the complainant notes that the dispute that gave rise to the presentation of the complaint in  was partially resolved thanks to the presentation of the complaint to the Committee, as when it was presented, the Government of the Province of Mendoza issued resolution No.  of  creating an mbito paritario (a meeting carried out on the basis of equality, in which decisions are taken collectively) for all graded staff operating under the Judicial Authority of Mendoza, with the Judicial Authority Negotiating Committee made up of Judiciary Officials from that province. The complainant notes that two members of the AFJM and one member of the AGEPJ participated in that committee, representing the workers. The complainant maintains that this does not conform with what was determined by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (CSJN) in a ruling issued on November , which put an end to the conflict between the organizations by establishing that the AFJM exercised sole representation of the graded staff in the sector. The complainant attached a copy of that ruling in which the CSJN indicated that: (i) the AFJM obtained legal recognition as a trade union in  to represent all the graded staff in the Judicial Authority of Mendoza; (ii) the AGEPJ appealed that decision, providing evidence that the graded staff were already covered by its own legal recognition as a trade union; (iii) while the National Appeals Chamber rejected those objections, it indicated that both entities share legal recognition as trade unions with regard to graded staff; and (iv) the AFJM lodged an extraordinary federal appeal against that ruling that was finally overturned by the CSJN, indicating that it was clear that the AGEPJ obtained legal recognition as a trade union in  excluding the representation of graded staff; so that when the AFJM requested legal recognition as a trade union, it did not have to compete for it with another association. The complainant alleges that the Ministry of Government, Labour and Justice did not arrange the composition of the Negotiating Committee in accordance with the guidelines established in the aforementioned CSJN ruling, which created an unjustified and unnecessary atmosphere of uncertainty.
.The complainant indicates that by means of an agreement, dated  December , a wage increase was granted and, without prejudice to that, it was also agreed that the separate collective bargaining forum for judiciary officials would remain open in order to continue deliberating over working conditions that were to be established in  (clause  of the agreement).
.The complainant also indicates that, in the context of the restructuring of the provincial judicial system, the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza handed down Decree No. . of November , which regulates working conditions relating to working hours and minimum workplace security guarantees for workers in the Interdisciplinary Auxiliary Corps under the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza (mental health, internal medicine and social work professionals specializing in different areas relating to childhood, adolescence and family, who participate in legal cases with jurisdiction in family law and criminal justice for minors), and for other agents of the Public Prosecutors Office who are subject to the same treatment. The complainant alleges that not only did the aforementioned decree remove the negotiation of working conditions from the collective bargaining forum, it did so while establishing conditions that violate the legal working time regime and security norms. The complainant indicates that the Decree created an off-site system for night guards on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays which aims to make workers completely available to their employer  hours a day and  days a year, and regulated entry into high conflict zones without minimum protection guarantees and lacking a mandatory protocol to ensure the physical safety of everybody involved, which violates the legal working time regime and security norms.
.The complainant states that, although it proposed taking part in the draft decree, advising that the new labour conditions be within the legal limits, the Decree does not make reference to the fact that it was the result of a consensus measure with the AFJM in collective agreements, which highlights that the decision was adopted unilaterally, in conflict with what was agreed in clause of the aforementioned agreement. Indeed, the complainant alleges that the approach of the paritario members from the Judicial Authority and the Government of Mendoza in the negotiation forum to debate working conditions was evasive and inconclusive, resorting to delaying tactics that obstructed and hindered a serious and consensual consideration of the issue that had been created which detracted from the active participation of the trade union organization.
.The complainant believes that the systematic excuses given ?both in the mbito paritario and elsewhere ?have a direct and negative impact on its legal capacity to debate and agree working conditions. The complainant notes that it was not heard and that all its efforts to have dialogue and reach consensus were fruitless or broke down. The complainant alleges that there has been no willingness to create proactive or favourable conditions for collective bargaining and that all bargaining power has been limited, restricted or cancelled. The complainant also alleges that for the past three years it has promoted the opening of its own forum for debate and for the drafting of the collective agreement for judiciary officials/graded staff that includes a wide range of issues relating to working conditions and the working environment. Lastly the complainant notes that there are a series of ongoing legal cases relating to the aforementioned events and provides a list of those cases. Those cases include: (i)an appeal for nullity with regard to the aforementioned Judicial Authority Decree; and (ii) an application for special judicial review for unconstitutionality and annulment that relates to the AFJM and AGEPJ submitted to the Supreme Court of Justice ?Second Chamber, Judicial Authority of Mendoza in the month of March  (case No. .).
.In its communication dated  June , the Government forwarded",-1,2015,Argentina
56,"a letter in which the Undersecretariat for Labour and Employment of the Ministry of Labour, Justice and Government in the Province of Mendoza indicates that: (i) in resolution  the Government Ministry arranged the establishment of a separate mbito paritario for the graded staff who work in a relationship of dependence for the Judicial Authority of Mendoza; (ii) this was implemented at the paritario meeting held on  May ; and (iii) during that negotiation, the secretary general of the AFJM committed to carrying out the relevant presentations, with a view to requesting the closure of the complaint submitted to the Committee (Case No.) after having created the separate mbito paritario, which was, appropriately, what motivated the presentation.
.In a communication dated  September , the Government submitted a copy of a note sent by the Regional Delegation of Mendoza to the Undersecretariat for Labour and Employment in the Ministry of Government, Labour and Justice in the province, in which the provincial government authorities are requested to send a detailed report on the issues set out in the complaint. This note emphasizes that the information requested is of vital importance for the defence that the Government must provide to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government notes that a special judicial review for unconstitutionality and annulment that relates to the AFJM and AGEPJ, submitted to the Supreme Court of Justice ?Second Chamber, Judicial Authority of Mendoza in the month of March , (Case No. .) is currently pending.
.The Committee observes that, although this complaint was presented in  by the AFJM, which represents the graded staff of the Judicial Authority in Mendoza Province, in  the Government reported that the issues contained therein had been resolved following the creation of an mbito paritario (a meeting carried out on the basis of equality, in which decisions are taken collectively) for all graded staff in the Judicial Authority of Mendoza, which is what had motivated the complaint, and so the secretary general of the AFJM had committed to requesting the closure of the complaint.
.The Committee notes that, in its  communication, the complainant notes that an mbito paritario for all graded staff was indeed established in , and a Judicial Authority negotiating committee was made up of judiciary officials from that province, in which the workers were represented by two representatives of the AFJM and one representative of the trade union organization known as AGEPJ. The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that the AGEPJ should not have been part of the committee since, on  November that same year, the CSJN had made it clear that AFJN was the sole trade union organization representing the graded staff of the Judicial Authority of Mendoza. The Committee observes that in this ruling the CSJN indicated that the AGEPJ obtained legal recognition as a trade union in  excluding the representation of graded staff and the AFJM obtained legal recognition as a trade union in  to represent the graded staff. The Committee understands that this ruling shows that, while both organizations have legal recognition as trade unions, and as such have bargaining power, the AFJM represents the graded staff of the Judicial Authority of Mendoza exclusively.
.The Committee observes that the Government notes in addition that a special judicial review for unconstitutionality and annulment that relates to the AFJM and AGEPJ, submitted to the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza in March , is currently pending. The Committee notes that it does not have further details regarding the specific subject of the case mentioned by the Government and observes that, according to the website of the Judicial Authority of Mendoza, there have been no movements in the case since .
.With regard to the configuration of the Negotiating Committee, the Committee observes that, according to the documentation provided by the complainant organization, Provincial Decree No./ establishes that when there is no agreement between the trade union organizations with bargaining power with regard to the configuration of the will of the worker sector in the Negotiating Committee, the Ministry of Government, through the Undersecretariat of Labour and Social Security, defines the percentage of votes corresponding to each party, with the number of votes being proportional to the number of contributing members.
.The Committee understands that the complainant objects to the participation of the AGEPJ in the Negotiating Committee because it is an mbito paritario for graded staff, who the complainant organization represents exclusively. The Committee nonetheless observes that it is not clear from the complaint whether the Negotiating Committee established in , known as the Judicial Authority Negotiating Committee for Judiciary Officials in the Province of Mendoza?was set up exclusively with regard to the graded staff. Without further details in that respect and observing that the Committee does not have information with regard to the functioning of this Committee since , the Committee hopes that its configuration conforms to what is provided in the relevant provincial regulations and that the ruling handed down by the CSJN on  November  is taken duly into account.
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza handed down a decree in November  which regulates working conditions for workers in the Interdisciplinary Auxiliary Corps under the Judicial Authority of Mendoza, which not only removed the negotiation of working conditions from the collective bargaining forum, it did so while establishing conditions that violate the legal working time regime and security norms. The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that the Decree was not agreed with the AFJM, that their attempts at dialogue with the Government have broken down, that for the past three years they have been promoting the drafting of a collective agreement for judiciary officials, and that there has been no willingness to create favourable conditions for collective bargaining.
.The Committee regrets that it has not received the Governments reply to these allegations. The Committee is obliged to examine them without significant information on the background of the matters raised in this case.
.The Committee observes that the Judicial Authoritys Decree indicates that it was necessary to strengthen the structure of the Interdisciplinary Auxiliary Corps (mental health, internal medicine and social work professionals who participate in legal cases with jurisdiction in family law and criminal justice for minors) and achieve full -hour coverage every day of the year. It also observes that the Decree was handed down one month before the wage agreement was reached in December  and that, in that agreement, the parties committed to continue deliberating over working conditions that were to be established in . That is to say that the commitment to negotiate working conditions came after the dictates of the Decree.
.The Committee observes that, although the Negotiating Committee was established in  and the parties committed to continue deliberating over working conditions in December , no agreement had been reached before the presentation of the complaint in May , at least. The Committee has not been given evidence of whether any agreements materialized between  and the present. In these circumstances, and observing that what the complainant organization is requesting is the possibility to negotiate the working conditions of graded staff in a separate mbito paritario, the Committee encourages the Government to take measures to create favourable conditions for constructive dialogue and effective negotiation between the parties concerned with regard to the working conditions of the graded staff of the Judicial Authority of the Province of Mendoza, with a view to reaching agreements in that respect.
.The Committee notes that the complainant indicates that there are a series of ongoing legal cases relating to the aforementioned events, including with regard to the Judicial Authority Decree, and that the Government also makes reference to a pending legal action before the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza. Not having any updated information on the matter, the Committee hopes that rulings will be promptly issued in that regard . In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this case is closed and does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee encourages the Government to take measures to create favourable conditions for constructive dialogue and effective negotiation between the parties concerned with regard to the working conditions of the graded staff of the Judicial Authority of the Province of Mendoza, with a view to reaching agreements in that respect.(b) The Committee hopes that rulings will be promptly issued with regard to the legal cases relating to the events mentioned in this case.(c) The Committee considers that this case is closed and does not call for further examination.",-1,2015,Argentina
57,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Mendoza Association of Health Professionals (AMPROS) and the Federation of Health Professionals of the Argentine Republic (FESPROSA) dated  February . The complainant organizations provide additional information in communications of June , April and June , and June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications of October , October  and February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  February , the complainant organizations indicate that, in May , a collective labour agreement was concluded with the government of Mendoza province, which covered all health professionals in the province for whom career-specific legislation was in place. The collective agreement was approved by Decree No. /. The decree and the collective agreement were then ratified by Act No. , published on October . At the same time, the Regularization Act (No. ) was adopted, which provided for the abolition of ad hoc contracts and contracts for the provision of services, with a view to ending precarious employment in the sector. The complainants emphasize that the provisions of the collective agreement recognized the genuine and subjective right of health professionals to be paid in accordance with the established wage structure, including for overtime worked.
.The complainant organizations allege that, after many years under this system, the government of Mendoza province, supported by its political majority, attempted to undo the abovementioned social progress with a series of regressive regulations, including with regard to the right to strike, removing the possibility for a group of health professionals to jointly negotiate their pay conditions through their trade union representatives. They refer in this respect to: (i) section  of Act No.  of  October , and its implications for remuneration and the maximum number of overtime hours in emergency activities; (ii) Act No.  of  October , which establishes limitations on pay with reference to the statutory remuneration for the post of governor of the province (Wage Ceiling Act) and, according to the complainants, represents a risk of pay cuts with clear discrimination against the most specialized and senior professionals, or those who cover inhospitable areas; and (iii) Ministry of Health Decision No.  of December , which calls into question the recruitment system set out in the collective agreement and ratified by Act No. .
.According to the complainants, measures were adopted unilaterally without the necessary negotiation between the parties concerned or even information being made available. They also allege that the government of the province, alongside this violation of collective bargaining, took repressive measures against the trade unions and made personal attacks on union leaders.
.The complainant organizations also allege that the Labour Reorganization Act (No.  of  November ) is having an impact on several aspects of freedom of association, in particular: (i) the issue of the classification of direct action measures by the Under-Secretariat of Labour and Employment: under section , the Under-Secretariat of Labour and Employment shall be responsible for declaring whether a direct action measure is illegal. In the event that essential services are affected, the prior decision of the Guarantees Commission is required? and (ii) the determination of a minimum service in essential services (section ). This section provides for a hearing to be held before the implementing authority so that the parties can agree on the minimum service to be maintained during the dispute, the arrangements for its implementation and the staff to be assigned to provide it. The complainants indicate, however, that under section  of the Act, if the parties do not reach an agreement within the specified time frame, or if the minimum service is insufficient, the implementing authority will refer the case to the Guarantees Commission, which will determine the minimum service. They therefore allege that that this provision, in the absence of specified time frames, represents an obstacle to strike action, as it depends solely on the will of a body which is itself answerable to the Government, thus transforming a simple and swift mandatory conciliation procedure into a unending, tortuous process, with the aim of rendering the right to strike indefinitely conditional in the face of any dissent, which is not in conformity with the Labour Regulations Act (No. ).
.Lastly, the complainant organizations allege that the disregard for collective bargaining was accompanied by attacks on trade union representatives, beginning with the calling into question of trade union leave, which had been established for many years through collective agreements. They allege that the principal rationale used by the provincial government for this practice was that the governor of the province had not approved the agreements. They also report attempts to force union leaders to retire and offensive comments made by the Minister of Health regarding the health sector trade unions.
.In their communication of June , the complainant organizations report that the implementation of Act No.  has led to significant pay cuts for the most qualified and senior workers in the public administration, who also have the longest working hours. They indicate that, in May , on account of the marked increase in inflation in the country, through joint negotiation in the health sector a pay increase of  per cent was agreed upon for all workers to offset the loss of purchasing power. However, this increase was not granted to all workers, as the Wage Ceiling Act was implemented, leading to a pay cut of up to percent for the most qualified workers who earned more than the governor of the province.
.In their communication of April , the complainant organizations allege a further violation of the right to collective bargaining through the adoption of Act No. , sections  and  of which, like the provisions of section  of Act No. , allow the executive authority to render workers?employment situation more precarious, leading to a decline in their conditions of work. They reiterate that professional workers are not only excluded from the overtime system, but there are also no statutory limits on their standard working hours. The complainants also allege that the power granted to the Ministry of Health allows it to transfer health professionals without any restrictions. Furthermore, they allege that collective bargaining is violated by Decree No. /, which provides for the suspension of the productivity bonus for all providers in the healthcare and assistance network of Mendoza province for  days, renewable for the same period or, where applicable, as long as the causes and effects from which it arose persist, in violation of higher-ranking legislation, namely Act No.  of December .
.In their communication of June , the complainant organizations allege personal attacks on trade union leaders, with attempted dismissals, huge deductions and the abolition of agreements, all aimed at eliminating representation in their workplaces, and draw particular attention to the harassment and discrimination suffered by the AMPROS trade union leader, Ms Gladys Velsquez. They explain that, in the context of pay negotiations between the workers and the employers in , there were demonstrations, assemblies and protests in workplaces and in the city in order to raise public awareness. The provincial government then decided to invoke criminal law and, in response to a demonstration by health workers on  March  as part of their call for a wage increase, the judicial authority declared that the demonstrators were violating the Penal Code and charged them under section  thereof, which provides as follows: Anyone who, albeit without endangering the public, impedes, obstructs or hinders the normal operation of land, water or air transport, or of public communication, water, electricity or fuel services, shall be liable to imprisonment of three months to two years.?The provincial judiciary heard that the actions concerned had led to streets being blocked and so they initiated investigations which gave rise to judicial proceedings (case No. FMZ /) for the alleged offence of obstructing public services. The complainants report that although the trial began in the ordinary (provincial) courts, it was then transferred to the federal courts, where it remains at present. They also allege that this provision of the Penal Code is being used in a discriminatory manner by the authorities, which is testimony to its sole purpose of social control.
.In its communication of June , AMPROS requested urgent intervention, indicating that the criminal proceedings against the union leader Ms Gladys Velsquez had not made any progress and that this constituted a permanent threat from the public authorities.
.In its communication of October , the Government reported that the present complaint was the subject of judicial proceedings brought before the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza by the complainant union. In its communication of October , the Government indicated that it had issued a protective measure preventing the province from implementing Act No.  and that the case concerning Ms Gladys",0,2015,Argentina
58,"Velsquez for the alleged offence of obstruction of public services was, at that time, before the federal courts.
.In a communication of February , the Government refers to the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza of  November  (case No. ), filed under: AMPROS et al v. Government of the Province of Mendoza re administrative proceedings, indicating that the filed administrative action was rejected. It also indicates that the following case is currently before the courts:Humberto Notti Paediatric Hospital v. Gladys Irene Velsquez re lifting of trade union immunity, before the Sixth Labour Division of the First District Court of Mendoza (case No. ), proceedings initiated to remove the respondents trade union immunity (section  of the Trade Unions Act (No. )) to enable receipt of retirement benefits. The Government indicates that, on  August , the Sixth Labour Division of the province of Mendoza allowed the lifting of trade union immunity for the purpose of lawfully ordering the union leader, who at that time was  years of age and had  years of service at the hospital, to initiate the relevant procedures for receipt of retirement benefits. The Government indicates that the division ruling (in cases Humberto Notti Paediatric Hospital v. Gladys Irene Velsquez re lifting of trade union immunity and Extraordinary plea of unconstitutionality/appeal for judicial review) was the subject of an extraordinary appeal and, on  April , the Supreme Court of the province rejected the appeal. It also notes that, although the plaintiff was elected to full union office and was granted paid trade union leave for a term of four years, by the time the ruling was issued and in view of the time which had elapsed since the original claim, the claim had ceased to have any practical validity.
.In another communication of February  regarding the alleged offence of obstruction of public services, the Government indicates that in September  the federal courts (Federal Court No.  of Mendoza) declared the extinction of the criminal proceedings by prescription.
.The Committee notes that the allegations in the present case refer to: (i) the calling into question of collective bargaining and collective agreements in the health sector in the province of Mendoza through the unilateral adoption of new regulations as from ; (ii)the calling into question of trade union rights through these regulations, particularly with regard to the classification of direct action measures (section  of Act No. of November ) and the definition of minimum services (section  of the Act); and (iii)discriminatory practices against union representatives.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations allege that the regulations adopted in  in the province of Mendoza endanger the favourable collective agreements that have been in force for some time in relation to wage levels, working time and the staff recruitment system. In particular, it notes the unions?indications regarding: (i) section  of Act No. of  October , and its implications for remuneration and the maximum number of overtime hours in emergency activities; (ii) Act No.  of  October , which provides for limits on pay with reference to the statutory remuneration for the post of governor of the province (Wage Ceiling Act) and, according to the complainants, represents a risk of wage cuts with clear discrimination against the most specialized and senior professionals, or those who cover inhospitable areas; and (iii) Ministry of Health Decision No.  of December , which modifies the recruitment system provided for in the collective agreement and ratified by Act No. . It notes that the Government provides information regarding Act No. , which is currently the subject of judicial proceedings brought by the complainant union before the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza. The Committee further welcomes the efforts in the meantime to issue a protective measure preventing application of Act No. .
.The Committee recalls that it is not competent to give opinions on the above-mentioned matters which were amended by legislation in . However, it considers that legislation that modifies collective agreements that have been in force for some time and tends to restrict the scope of collective bargaining runs counter to voluntary collective negotiation, since it is for the parties concerned to decide on the subjects for negotiation. In this respect it recalls that, with regard to allegations concerning the refusal to bargain collectively on certain matters in the public sector, the Committee previously recalled the view of the Fact Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association that there are certain matters which clearly appertain primarily or essentially to the management and operation of government business; these can reasonably be regarded as outside the scope of negotiation? It is equally clear that certain other matters are primarily or essentially questions relating to conditions of employment and that such matters should not be regarded as falling outside the scope of collective bargaining conducted in an atmosphere of mutual good faith and trust [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the plea of unconstitutionality (Act No. ) pending before the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza and of any measure that may be adopted pursuant to it.
.With regard to the Labour Reorganization Act (No.  of  November ), the Committee notes the complainant organizations?allegations that, under section  of this Act, if the parties do not reach an agreement on establishing a minimum service in essential services within the specified time frame, or if the minimum service is insufficient, the implementing authority will refer the case to the Guarantees Commission, which will determine the minimum service. According to the complainants, this would represent an obstacle to strike action, as it depends solely on the will of a body which is itself answerable to the Government.
.The Committee notes in regard to the health sector that the hospital sector may be considered to be an essential service [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ], in which strikes may be restricted. As to the allegations concerning the competent authority to determine the minimum services and its impact on their trade union rights, the Committee wishes to recall that the workers who do not perform duties in essential services in the strict sense of the term should be able to participate in the definition of minimum services and any disagreement between the parties on this matter should be resolved by an independent body.
.Regarding the classification of direct action measures (section  of Act No. ), the Committee notes that this section provides that the Under-Secretariat of Labour and Employment shall be responsible for declaring whether a direct action measure is illegal. In the event that essential services are affected, the prior decision of the Guarantees Commission is required? The Committee wishes to recall in this respect that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the government, but with an independent and impartial body [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. In view of the above, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the provincial government takes the necessary measures, including of legislative nature, to ensure that responsibility for declaring a direct action illegal does not lie with the provincial government but with an independent and impartial body.
.As regards the allegations of anti-union discrimination and in particular the pressure exerted on the AMPROS trade union leader Ms Gladys Velsquez, the Committee notes the ruling of  August  of the Sixth Labour Division of the province of Mendoza, which allowed the lifting of trade union immunity in order to oblige the union leader (who at that time was  years of age and had  years of service) to initiate the relevant procedures for receipt of retirement benefits. Regarding the allegations of harassment and discrimination suffered by the union leader, who was prosecuted by the federal authorities for having participated in a social protest in , the Committee notes the Governments indication in its communication of February  that in September  the federal courts (Federal Court No.  of Mendoza) declared the extinction of the criminal proceedings by prescription. While noting that for this reason there are no longer any charges against the trade union leader, the Committee trusts that this provision of the Penal Code will not be used in a manner as to stigmatize trade union leaders legitimately exercising their functions.
.With regard to the alleged calling into question of trade union leave which had been established through collective agreements for many years, the Committee notes the complainants?indications that the principal rationale used by the provincial government for this practice was that the governor of the province had not approved the agreements. In the absence of further details from the Government, the Committee considers that collective agreements enter into force at the time of signature, while the requirement for their registration by the competent authorities is valid when they affect the interests of third parties.
.In the light of its foregoing",-1,2015,Argentina
59,"conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the plea of unconstitutionality (Act No. ) pending before the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza and of any measure that may be adopted pursuant to it.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the provincial government takes the necessary measures, including the adoption of legislative proposals, to ensure that responsibility for declaring a direct action illegal does not lie with the provincial government but with an independent and impartial body.(c)	The Committee encourages the competent authorities to seek deeper social dialogue with the associations of health professionals in the interest of promoting harmonious collective relations.",-1,2015,Argentina
60,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of State Workers (ATE) dated  February . The ATE sent additional information in a communication dated  April .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated May, September and October , February and July , and February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  February , the ATE indicates that, on  March  and  April , its federal capital executive board issued calls for elections of staff representatives and internal board members in the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights and that both calls were challenged by a group of ATE members and internal board candidates, who argued that the calls did not comply with a decision of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MTESS) requiring elections to be carried out at each facility or building of the Ministry. The complainant organization indicates that the MTESS, through the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations (DNAS), upheld both objections and observed that the calls had not been issued in accordance with MTESS Decision No. /, which provides that: (i) elections must be carried out at each facility belonging to the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, and (ii) both workers who are union members and workers who are not members of any trade union and who have not participated in the elections of another national State trade union are eligible to vote in elections of staff representatives. On  May , the DNAS advised the ATE to carry out the elections in accordance with the above-mentioned decision, by allowing all the employees of the relevant establishment to vote in the elections of staff representatives.
.The complainant organization states that it was not possible for it to comply with the decision, as it had no means of identifying persons who were not members of any trade union who had not participated in the elections of another State trade union. It adds that, according to the statutes of the ATE, only union members may participate in its elections of staff representatives. The complainant indicates that, after holding elections on  May , it filed an appeal for the reconsideration and hierarchical re-examination of the DNAS decision of  May  and that the appeal was rejected by the MTESS in September . The complainant also indicates that, in October , the DNAS ordered it to issue a new call for elections within a ten-day period and that when it did not do so, on  December, the DNAS proposed the appointment of an official to call elections of staff representatives and internal board members in the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. The complainant alleges that the State interfered in the internal affairs of the ATE, as the implementing authority unilaterally called elections of staff representatives and internal board members, and it also alleges interference by the employer, as the MTESS is both judge and party. The complainant indicates that it filed appeals for the reconsideration of the administrative decisions and that, when they were rejected, it filed a judicial appeal in accordance with article  of Act No. . on trade union associations.
.In its communications of May, September and October , February and July , and February , the Government reports that the national courts have already ruled on the alleged acts in the present case and that, in this regard, final judgments have been handed down. The Government indicates that this case began when a group of ATE members and internal board candidates in the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights challenged the call for elections issued by the federal capital executive board of the ATE. According to the Government, as a result of the objection, the DNAS observed that the terms of the call had not been in line with Ministerial Decision No. /, which provides that the contributing members of each trade union organization are eligible to vote in the elections of staff representatives, without prejudice to the right of non-member workers to participate in the elections, as long as they do not participate in the elections of representatives conducted by another co-existing trade union organization, as ATE staff representatives represent all workers, regardless of whether they are ATE members or not. In May , the MTESS informed the ATE that all calls for elections must be in line with its decision and, in October , in view of the time that had passed and the ATEs failure to issue a new call for elections, the DNAS ordered the ATE to issue, within ten days of the notification, a new call that would be in accordance with Ministerial Decision No. /. The Government indicates that, in December , as there was no evidence that the ATE had complied with the request, it was proposed that an official should be appointed to call elections of staff representatives and internal board members in the Ministry.
.The Government indicates that the MTSS rejected the ATEs appeals for the reconsideration and hierarchical re-examination of the decisions in which it was requested to issue a new call for elections and that, in accordance with section  of Act No. , the ATE applied to the courts. According to the Government, in a judgment handed down on  October , Chamber IX of the National Labour Court of Appeal upheld the administrative decisions that were under appeal. As can be seen in the copy of the judgment provided by the Government, the Court of Appeal: (i) while affirming the need for caution with regard to public authority interference in the internal affairs of trade union associations in accordance with, inter alia, the provisions of Act No.  on trade union associations and the principles of freedom of association enshrined in Convention No. , found that the Ministry of Labour acts as an implementing authority of the Act, which gives it, in principle, full supervisory authority, and (ii) found that the intervention in this case is neither arbitrary nor unfounded, since, as the appellant acknowledges, a specific objection was raised by some ATE members and which is significant, especially given that, as workers, they are also entitled to elect their representatives.
.The Government has also included a copy of the judgment issued on  December  by the same Court of Appeal in relation to the extraordinary appeal filed by the ATE. In the judgment, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on the grounds that it did not contain a concrete and reasoned critique of the factual and legal grounds of the judgment in question. In its latest communication of February , the Government states that these judgments are final and approved.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges interference by the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations (DNAS) of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MTESS) in the elections of staff representatives and the internal board members of the Association of State Workers (ATE) in the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights.
.From the information submitted by the complainant organization and by the Government, the Committee observes that: (i) the call for elections of staff representatives and the internal board members of the ATE in the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, which was issued first in  and again in , was challenged on both occasions by a group of ATE members and internal board candidates on the grounds of alleged irregularities (the call did not comply with an MTESS decision requiring elections to be carried out at each facility or building of the Ministry); (ii) the DNAS upheld both objections and observed that the calls had not been issued in accordance with MTESS Decision No. /, which provides that elections of staff representatives must be carried out at each facility/building of an entity and that both workers who are union members and workers who are not members of any trade union and have not participated in the elections of another national State trade union are eligible to vote in such elections (the Committee observes in this regard that Ministerial Decision No. / refers to the election of staff representatives and not to the election of internal board members of the ATE); and (iii) on  October , the DNAS ordered the ATE to call elections within a ten-day period, in accordance with the abovementioned decision and, on  December, noting the lack of compliance with its request, the DNAS decided to appoint an official to call elections of staff representatives and internal board members in the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights.
.The Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization, by ordering it to issue a new call for elections of staff representatives and internal board members, the administrative authority committed an act of interference outside its remit, undermining its freedom",0,2015,Argentina
61,"of association and union autonomy. The Committee also notes that the ATE filed appeals for the reconsideration of the DNAS decisions and that the appeals were rejected by the administrative authority. The Committee notes that, according to the complainant and the Government, after exhausting administrative remedies, the ATE applied to the courts.
.The Committee observes that, according to the information provided by the Government, the Labour Court of Appeal rejected the allegations of interference and upheld the administrative decisions under appeal. The Committee notes that the Government has provided a copy of the judgments handed down by the Court of Appeal, dated  October and  December , and observes that, in the judgments, the Court: (i) while affirming the need for caution with regard to public authority interference in the internal affairs of trade union associations, in accordance with the provisions of Act No.  and the principles of freedom of association enshrined in Convention No. , found that the MTESS acts as an implementing authority of the Act, which gives it, in principle, full supervisory authority, and (ii) found that the intervention in this case is neither arbitrary nor unfounded, since a specific objection was raised by some ATE members and which is significant, especially given that, as workers, they are also entitled to elect their representatives. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the judgments are final.
.The Committee also observes that, according to publicly available information, on  April , the ATE national leadership, together with the general secretaries from the provinces, unanimously approved new rules governing the election of representatives and internal boards of the ATE throughout the country, and observes in particular that article  of the rules provides that: Representatives must be elected in a direct, secret vote by members at the time when the call is published, as well as by workers who are not members of any trade union and who express a desire to participate in the elections, as long as they have not participated in other elections of representatives held by another trade union during the same year. Therefore, workers in the sector who are not members of any trade union must be informed of the call for elections and may register to vote within  calendar days, by expressing their desire to the election supervisory body and submitting the necessary paperwork, at the time and place indicated on the call for elections.?Moreover, article  establishes that: When the membership of a body exceeds , an internal board must also be elected in a direct, secret vote by members at the time when the call is published.?In the light of the above-mentioned judgments and the amended ATE statutes, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",2,2015,Argentina
62,".The complaint is contained in a communication of May  from the Association of Staff of Supervisory Bodies (APOC).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of May , the complainant organization alleges that the Court of Audit and the legislature of Santa Fe Province are hindering the exercise of the right to bargain collectively in the sector.
.APOC considers that the authorities of the Court of Audit of Santa Fe Province have unduly delayed the establishment of a bargaining committee, thereby preventing the complainant organization from participating in joint negotiations in the sector and from discussing and negotiating working conditions and wage policies, as would be appropriate for an organization with trade union status. APOC alleges that the aforementioned Court (which operates under the authority of the legislature and has the power to take decisions concerning the pay and working conditions of its staff, subject to the involvement and opinion of the Legislative Audit and Oversight Committee) makes it compulsory, however, to apply the working conditions and wage policies determined by the Joint Committee under Act No. , a committee from which the complainant organization is excluded and the scope of which is limited to the staff of the provincial public administration, which operates under the authority of the executive branch. APOC also alleges that the Courts employees are affiliated to an organization, APOC, which has trade union status (status of most representative organization for the purposes of collective bargaining) and competence to act in matters pertaining to the Court. Therefore, the complainant organization filed a complaint with the Ministry of Labour, which subsequently issued Opinion No.  in , calling for the appointment of the members of the bargaining committee. However, the Court did not establish the committee, claiming that it was prevented by law from doing so on the grounds that it was not fully constituted, as it was lacking one of its five members. APOC considers this reason to be unfounded and dilatory. At present, the members of the Court of Audit continue to take all decisions relating to staff and salaries, but employees are prevented from discussing and negotiating their conditions of work and pay. As the situation had not been resolved, in April  APOC lodged an appeal against Decree No. / of the government of Santa Fe Province, which provided for the application of the working conditions approved by the Joint Committee under Act No. to the employees of the Court of Audit. In the absence of a reply, an application for amparo (enforcement of constitutional rights) on the grounds of delays was filed with the Santa Fe courts of justice. In , there was a further refusal to establish a bargaining committee and the Joint Committee under Act No.  agreed on increases and working conditions for the staff of the Court of Audit which were endorsed by the Court without APOC being able to participate. As a result, APOC submitted a list of demands by the staff of the Court of Audit with the signatures of  employees (over  per cent of the staff). This initiative was supported by the General Confederation of Labour for the Santa Fe region; the Chamber of Senators endorsed most of the points set out in a request for information sent to the Court of Audit in April .
.The complainant organization also alleges that the provincial state, through its legislature, has not established the Legislative Audit and Oversight Committee, which plays a very important role in the bargaining process, as the only instance with higher supervisory authority over the court, including in pay and labour-related matters.
.In its communication of  October , the Government forwards the reply by the government of Santa Fe province to the allegations made by APOC and stresses that other trade union organizations hold the most representative status based on objective criteria. The Government considers the matter to be a dispute between trade union organizations, which should be settled by those concerned in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.
.Regarding the allegations of obstruction and delays, the provincial government indicates that the Court of Audit stated that it was not able to participate in the negotiations because it was not fully constituted (at present, two of the five regular members have not been appointed). Similarly, the Government reports that the Court does not have the power to make decisions pertaining to the labour and wage arrangements applicable to staff, because the Legislative Audit and Oversight Committee has not yet been established and by law such decisions are subject to the involvement and preliminary opinion of that Committee.
.The provincial governments report states that the Court of Audit, with the endorsement of opinions by the State Prosecutors Office, has adopted resolutions that make the regulations and collective agreements relating to the provincial public administration, which operates under the authority of the executive branch, applicable to the Courts staff. It states that, in the context of the provincial public administration operating under the authority of the executive branch, the capacity for concluding collective agreements lies with the organization with trade union status that is most representative in the area of activity. It states that this status is held by the Association of State Workers (ATE) and the National Civil Servants?Union (UPCN). It concludes that, accordingly, the public employees of the Court of Audit are not without means of defending their rights, as they are represented by these organizations in the Joint Committee under Act No. .
.The provincial government indicates that APOC participates in the meetings of employees with members of the Court and its inputs and suggestions are taken into account. It states that APOC is seeking to establish its own joint committee, awarding itself the status of sole representative union on the grounds of its specific nature, but that it does not have the approval of the other trade union organizations in this respect.
.Regarding the allegations that the exercise of collective bargaining is being hindered and delayed by the Court of Audit to the detriment of the complainant organization, the Committee notes that, despite an opinion by the Ministry of Labour calling for the appointment of members of a bargaining committee, the Court of Audit has not yet established the committee. The provincial government indicates that the fact that the court is not fully constituted (two regular members had not been appointed) and the fact that the Legislative Audit and Oversight Committee has not been established are hindering the bargaining process. The Committee expects that the measures necessary to resolve these problems will be taken soon.
.The Committee notes that the Government also claims that two other organizations hold the status of most representative organization and that the public employees of the Court are not without means of defending their rights, as they are represented by these organizations in collective agreements. The Committee notes, however, that the complainant organization has recognized union status (and is therefore recognized as most representative organization) in its area of activity.
.In this regard, the Committee considers the complainant organizations demand to negotiate on behalf of the employees of the Court of Audit to be legitimate, given that employees in this sector (who fall under the authority of the legislature) may have interests that differ from those of employees of the provincial public administration, who fall under the authority of the executive branch and who are represented by the other two trade unions. Hence, the Committee firmly expects that the Government will take steps so that the public authorities concerned will soon adopt the institutional measures that are necessary to allow for the establishment of the Court of Audits bargaining committee and to effectively promote collective bargaining with the complainant organization (APOC) and that the Government and the complainant organization will keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeals lodged by the complainant organization in connection with this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Considering that APOC should be able to bargain collectively in respect of the Court of Audit of the province on behalf of its members, the Committee firmly expects that the Government will take steps so that the public authorities concerned will soon adopt the institutional measures that are necessary to allow for the establishment of the Court of Audits bargaining committee and to effectively promote collective bargaining with the complainant organization. The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organization to keep it informed of developments.(b)	The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeals lodged by the complainant organization in connection with this case.",-1,2014,Argentina
63,".The complaints are contained in a communication dated  June  from the Union of Employees of the National Judiciary (UEJN), supported by the General Confederation of Labour of the Argentine Republic (CGT RA), and in subsequent communications from the UEJN dated  June ,  April  and  June .
.The Government sent its replies in communications dated  July and  September ,  March , May  and  June , as well as two communications dated October.
.Since similar issues are raised in the two complaints, Cases Nos  and  will be examined together by the Committee.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  June , the UEJN and the CGT RA allege, at the outset, that the Argentine Government is using internal regulatory instruments to restrict judicial workers?exercise of the right to bargain collectively regarding their working conditions. The organizations report that in order to remedy this situation, draft legislation was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies with a view to the establishment of a uniform collective bargaining regime for the judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the  Argentine provinces. They state that it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies and that although the relevant Senate committees issued a favourable opinion on it and it was placed on the Senates agenda on three occasions, it was never considered and, as a consequence, the draft legislation expired pursuant to Act No. .
.The complainants add that judicial workers do not fall within the scope of Act No. , which regulates the right to bargain collectively in the public sector. They consider that not only does the absence of national legislation guaranteeing the right of employees of the national judiciary to bargain collectively and regulating the exercise of that right affect the interests and working conditions of those employees; it also has an impact on and serves as a deterrent to collective bargaining by judicial workers in all of the provincial jurisdictions since, notwithstanding the countrys federal system, the provinces adopt laws and mechanisms through which they agree to be bound by domestic law. The complainants also allege that the Argentine Government cannot invoke the separation of powers under the national Constitution as grounds for not adopting legislation that would grant judicial workers the right to bargain collectively since, in , the Government introduced and Congress adopted Act No.  regulating the hiring of all public servants and other employees of the judiciary and the national public prosecution services.
.In a communication sent in , drawing attention to Case No. , in which the Committee on Freedom of Association recommended that the Argentine Government should take measures adapted to national conditions, including legislative measures if necessary, to promote collective bargaining between judiciary authorities and the trade union organizations concerned? and the similar observations of the Committee of Expert on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with regard to the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the complainants add that by failing to adopt legislation on the right of judicial workers to bargain collectively, the Argentine Government has not followed any of the observations and recommendations of the International Labour Organization (ILO) supervisory bodies and that, despite the supervisory bodies?urging, there has been no progress whatsoever on the issue.
.The complainants further allege that the Argentine Government and the judicial authorities are interfering with the UEJN both at the national level and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. They maintain that: (i) the emergence of the Union of Judicial Workers of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (SITRAJUCABA), a pseudo-union, has led to the unlawful diversion of , members of the UEJN; (ii) Ms Vanesa Raquel Siley, General Secretary of SITRAJUCABA, has links with the political party in power at the time of the events in question; (iii) both at the national level and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the UEJN has been subjected to threats and persecution by the Attorney-General, MsAlejandra Gil Carbn, and the President of the Council of the Judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Mr Juan Manuel Olmos; (iv) this persecution worsened after  February , when the UEJN held a demonstration in front of the law courts and demanded additional information on the death of a prosecutor, Mr Alberto Nisman, who had been murdered a month earlier; (v) with the collusion of the President of the Council of the Judiciary, the pseudo-union misappropriated information on the UEJNs members and erased the hard drives of the computers in the latters offices; and (vi) the aforementioned events occurred at a time when the countrys then Minister of Labour, Employment and Social Security, Mr Carlos A. Tomada, who had links with the political party, Frente para la Victoria (Onward to Victory), was encouraging the emergence of yellow trade unions? having subjected the unions that did not share the official ideology to years of procedural delays while facilitating the registration process for other unions; in that regard, the complainants state that the Union of Judicial Workers (SITRAJU) and SITRAJUCABA were registered on  April  (Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security decisions Nos / and /), just four days after the registration process began. Lastly, the complainants accuse the Government and the judicial authorities of providing direct and indirect support to SITRAJU and SITRAJUCABA.
.In its communication of  April , the UEJN alleges, first, that the Council of the Judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CMCABA), hereinafter the local judicial body? arbitrarily excluded it from collective bargaining in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires even though it had signed a compromise agreement, agreeing to bargain collectively with the UEJN, on  December . The complainant maintains that the judicial body excluded it from the collective bargaining process in violation of its trade union rights and, on  November , signed a collective labour agreement with the Association of Employees of the Judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (AEJBA), a trade association that is registered only at the local level, and SITRAJUCABA, against which the complainant states that it has filed several criminal complaints and whose trade union status has been challenged in the courts. The complainant also recalls its allegation that there is no regulation of collective bargaining in any of the geographical areas over which the judiciary has jurisdiction and adds that, to date, there has been no collective bargaining in the sector as required by national legislation. The complainant also reports that the judicial body has conducted de facto?collective bargaining with trade union entities that, under Argentine law, were not authorized to bargain because they did not have the required trade union status (personera gremial).
.In a subsequent communication, the complainant mentions a meeting between CMCABA, AEJBA and SINTRAJOCABA, which was held on  April  in order to negotiate the wages and working conditions of judicial workers and to make any necessary changes in the current collective agreement. The complainant states that on the date in question, it arrived prepared to negotiate and was denied entry to the premises on the sole pretext that it was not empowered to bargain collectively. Lastly, the complainant maintains that it has exhausted domestic remedies in so far as it has made unsuccessful requests for cancellation of the registration of SITRAJUCABA and of the collective agreement.
.The UEJN further alleges that the local judicial body has committed acts of trade union interference, giving preferential treatment to SITRAJUCABA and AEJBA. It states that: (i)pursuant to the collective agreement, these two unions were subsidized through contributions from the employer amounting to . per cent of the total wages paid to employees of the judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires in order to defray the costs of their trade union activities; (ii) the President of the Council of the Judiciary, in decision No. /, ordered the employer to pay a supplement amounting to ,  and  per cent, respectively, of the wages of Mr Jos Alberto Olmos and Mr Adrin Javier Pafunto, (representing SINTRAJU) and Mr Carlos Daniel Daz (representing AEJBA) in order to establish the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Labour Policy and Labour Relations under the collective labour agreement; (iii) the associations that signed the collective labour agreement, but not the complainant, were granted private offices in buildings belonging to the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; and (iv) each of the signatory entities?trade union representatives were granted ten hours of paid trade union leave per month; in an act of discrimination, the UEJN was not granted such leave.
.In a communication received on  August , the Government indicates that by virtue of the separation of powers in the republican system enshrined in the Constitution, it has forwarded",0,2014,Argentina
64,"the complainants allegations regarding barriers to collective bargaining in the national judiciary to the Supreme Court. In a second communication dated  March , the Government forwards the Supreme Courts statement that it will not rule on this case. In a communication of May , the Government reiterates that, owing to the countrys republican and federal regime and pursuant to the Constitution, each provincial government may regulate the separation of powers and the competencies of each of those powers in accordance with its own constitution? The Government also mentions sections ,  and  of the federal Constitution, which states that the provinces shall retain all powers not delegated to the Federal Government by this Constitution or expressly reserved by special agreement at the time of their incorporation?and that the provinces are governed by their own local institutions; they elect governors, legislators and other provincial officials without interference from the Federal Government. The Government further states that the country has  provincial states and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and that each of them has been adopting its own legislation for years in light of its specific characteristics and conditions. On this point, the Government refers to the Committee on Freedom of Associations Case No. , in which the Association of Judicial Officers of Mendoza (AFJM) alleged that the Government of Mendoza province had failed to comply with the relevant Convention and the complainant dropped the complaint after signing a sectoral collective agreement with the provincial government. Lastly, the Government maintains that active wage negotiations have resulted in progress in the judiciaries of the various provinces. In its most recent communication (of October ), the Government states that Autarchic Act No. , which regulates the functioning of the judiciary, strengthens the latters independence; it reiterates that wage negotiations with the judiciary are ongoing in many provinces. In that connection, the Government mentions that: (i) there is already collective bargaining with the judiciary in Ro Negro and Santa Cruz provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, all three of which have adopted legislation regulating it; (ii) Santiago del Estero province reports that bargaining with the judiciary is being conducted at a round table with the relevant social stakeholders; and (iii) Neuqun and Crdoba provinces report that they have procedures for voluntary bargaining in the judiciary and that all relevant social stakeholders are notified in such cases.
.In a communication dated  June , the Government forwards the local judicial bodys response to the UEJNs allegations regarding the negotiation of a collective agreement within the Buenos Aires judiciary and interference in favour of other trade unions. With regard to these allegations, the local judicial body categorically denies having discriminated against the UEJN by excluding it from collective bargaining, failing to follow the recommendations of ILO supervisory bodies, interfering with the exercise of trade union rights, showing favouritism to other trade unions and conducting de facto?collective bargaining with trade union entities that did not have the required trade union status (personera gremial). It states that it is only competent to comment on the situation of the local judiciary since section  of the federal Constitution establishes that the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires shall have a system of autonomous government with its own legislative and judicial powers. It maintains that for this reason, the complainants complaint that judicial workers are unable to bargain collectively at the national level is irrelevant because a collective labour agreement was recently signed at the local level.
.Concerning the exclusion of the UEJN from collective bargaining, the local judicial body points out that the collective labour agreement was the outcome of joint efforts by itself and the trade unions and that the scope of the agreement includes all workers, regardless of whether they belong to a specific trade union. With respect to the agreement signed on December , the local judicial body explains that it was envisaged that, in addition to the employer, the signatories would be the two most representative trade union entities ?which were, at that time, the UEJN and the AEJBA ?since the statistics provided by the legal secretary in the Department of Human Resources showed that they had  and  members, respectively. However, by the time the collective labour agreement was signed on  November , the UEJN had become less representative than SITRAJUCABA, which had been entered in the Registry of Trade Unions of Workers in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires on  April . Thus, when the collective labour agreement was signed in , the signatories were the AEJBA and SITRAJU, which, again according to data provided by the Department of Human Resources, had , and , members, respectively. The UEJN was excluded from the bargaining because it had  members (. per cent of all trade union members). The local judicial entity also indicates that, according to information contained in Department of Human Resources memorandum No. of  February , the delegates who had represented the UEJN at the signing of the compromise agreement on  December  had changed unions and were members of SINTRAJU when the collective agreement was signed.
.The local judicial body states that in calling the AEJBA a trade association that is registered only at the local level?and SITRAJUCABA a pseudo-union? the UEJN is attempting to limit the participation of other labour groups, the coexistence of trade unions and the formation of new ones even though the complainant has always functioned locally as a sectional trade union and has not even been registered at the local level. It also states that it was the Committee on Freedom of Association that drew the Governments attention to the elimination of distinctions between trade unions and that, by making such a distinction, the complainant violated the principles established by the Committee. It adds that it has always maintained an ongoing dialogue with all trade union groups, regardless of their registration status.
.The local judicial body states that the ILO supervisory bodies have always considered that recognition of the most representative trade union does not violate the principles of freedom of association, provided that certain objective requirements are met and that the advantages are limited to the granting of certain preferential rights. It also explains that the fact that the AEJBA, SITRAJUCABA and the UEJN participate at the local level demonstrates respect for the principles of freedom of association and the promotion of trade union pluralism in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. It explains that, given that two of the local judiciarys trade unions are registered only at the local level and that only the complainant has trade union status at the national ?though not the local ?level, priority was given to the most representative unions during the bargaining in question. It states that although section  of the Trade Unions Act (Act No. ) authorizes the withholding of dues from wages only in the case of unions with trade union status, not those that are registered only at the local level, it withholds dues for all three of the trade unions that operate at the local level. Furthermore, although sections  and  of the Act provide that only individuals with trade union status shall enjoy trade union immunity, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires has decided to accord favourable treatment at the local level to all trade union representatives in order to avoid discriminating against any of them.
.The local judicial body explains that between December  and the date on which the collective labour agreement was signed, for reasons totally unrelated to the agreement, a new trade union entity ?which, in many workers?view, better represented them ?was established. Thus, the local judicial body acted correctly by taking note of the number of members reported by the trade unions in a timely manner and ensuring that workers and their associations enjoyed freedom of association; the fact that it bargained collectively with entities that were registered only at the local level or did not have trade union status does not constitute a violation of the right to freedom of association.
.As for the contribution made pursuant to an agreement, the local judicial body indicates that this contribution is not a subsidy, but rather an input pursuant to section  of the Trade Unions Act; its purpose is not to defray the costs of trade union activity but, as provided in section  of the collective labour agreement, to fund cultural and social activities and support planned new vocational training that will be available to the entire judicial community, regardless of trade union membership or lack thereof.
.With regard to the supplements paid to members of the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Labour Policy and Labour Relations under the collective labour agreement, the local judicial body indicates that the Committees establishment is envisaged in section(i) of the Basic Legal Regime Governing Judges, Public Servants and other Employees of the Judiciary, adopted through Council of Ministers decision No. /, which empowers the Council of the Judiciary to grant specific",0,2014,Argentina
65,"wage supplements on duly substantiated grounds at a percentage rate specified in the documents establishing the Standing Committee. In that connection, Presidential decision No. / authorized the establishment of a supplement for the Standing Committees coordinators in light of their additional responsibilities and the novelty of implementation of the first collective agreement. The local judicial body also mentions section  of that agreement, which calls for the establishment of the Standing Committee and sets out its functions.
.The local judicial body further states that, contrary to the complainants claims, the trade unions?noticeboards and offices are not for the exclusive use of SITRAJUCABA and the AEJBA; section  of the collective labour agreement does not specify their physical location, merely stating that they will be provided if the employer is able to do so. It adds that to date, there are no specific offices devoted to trade union activities, nor has the complainant requested such an office. Concerning the ten hours?leave per month that is granted to each of the signatory trade unions?officials, the local judicial body states that the time granted is proportionate to the representativeness of each union.
.With respect to the complainants?allegations of interference, the local judicial body states that it had nothing to do with the formation, operations or administration of any trade union; it adds that allowing the most representative unions to participate in no way implies State interference. It goes on to say that in order for an action to constitute interference with the exercise of trade union rights, there must be a clear intention to place these unions under the control of an employer or an employers?organization and that there is no evidence whatsoever of such an intention or of favouritism towards a given trade union, particularly as the complainant has supplied no evidence in that regard. In light of the foregoing, the local judicial body maintains that the complaint is factually and legally groundless; that the collective labour agreement is the outcome of a difficult effort by the employer and the signatory trade unions and benefits all employees of the local judiciary, including UEJN members; that the reported actions do not constitute violations of trade union rights; and that the complaint should therefore be dismissed.
.In its communication of  October , the Government forwards an additional response from the local judicial body. At the outset, the latter reiterates its previous observations and, in particular, its denial that the UEJN is registered in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and that there has been any attempt to eliminate it. It goes on to deny that it denied the UEJNentry to the meeting held by the CMCABA, the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA on April .
.The Committee observes that both Case No.  and Case No.  concern, on the one hand, allegations of violation of the right to bargain collectively in the judicial sector and, on the other, allegations of favouritism and interference to the detriment of the UEJN. The Committee notes that some of these allegations concern the status of the administration of justice at the national level while others are limited to the administration of justice in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.
.First, with regard to the allegation that the persistent absence of legislation recognizing and regulating the right of judicial workers throughout the country to bargain collectively prevents the workers in question from exercising that right, the Committee takes note of the complainants?statement that: (i) the Chamber of Deputies adopted draft legislation regulating collective bargaining uniformly for all of the countrys judicial workers; (ii)however, although all of its relevant committees had issued a favourable opinion on it, the Senate decided not to consider this draft; and (iii) not only does the absence of national legislation guaranteeing the right of employees of the national judiciary to bargain collectively and regulating the exercise of that right affect the interests and working conditions of those employees, it also has an impact on and serves as a deterrent to collective bargaining by judicial workers in all of the provincial jurisdictions since, notwithstanding the countrys federal system, the provinces adopt laws and mechanisms through which they agree to be bound by domestic law. The Committee also takes note of the Governments statement that: (i) under the Argentine institutional model, the provinces retain all powers not delegated to the Federal Government under the Constitution; (ii) the  provincial states and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires have been adopting their own legislation for years in light of their specific characteristics and conditions; and (iii) active wage negotiations with the judiciary are taking place in a growing number of provinces as evidenced by the collective agreements signed in Mendoza, Ro Negro and Santa Cruz provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the negotiations conducted in Santiago del Estero, Neuqun and Crdoba provinces.
.The Committee takes note of this information and emphasizes that although it is not for it to comment on the division of legislative powers among the various levels of government, it is competent to ascertain whether the current regulatory framework or lack thereof is hindering access to or exercise of the right to bargain collectively. In that regard, in a previous case concerning Argentina, the Committee recalled that while in the preparatory work for Convention No. , it was established that judges of the judiciary do not fall within the scope of implementation of the Convention; nevertheless, the said Convention does not exclude the auxiliary staff of judges. Also, according to Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, only armed forces and the police may be excluded from its scope. The Committee further recalled that while the same Article provides that while special modalities of the application of this Convention may be fixed, it deemed that auxiliary staff of the judiciary must have the right to collective bargaining. It therefore requested the Government to take measures adapted to national conditions, including legislative measures if necessary, to promote collective bargaining between the judiciary and the trade union organizations concerned [see Case No. , th Report, para. ]. While taking due note of the significant progress in collective bargaining in the judiciaries of a growing number of provinces and the fact that in several cases, this progress has followed the adoption of provincial legislation in that regard, the Committee notes that there is still no collective bargaining either in the majority of the countrys provincial judiciaries or in the national judiciary. It also notes that this absence of collective bargaining is still accompanied by the absence of a regulatory framework for collective bargaining in the sector in the various geographical regions. In that connection, the Committee reaffirms that its recommendations in Case No.  remain fully valid.
.Second, with regard to the alleged exclusion of the complainant from the first instance of collective bargaining in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the Committee takes note of the complainants statement that: (i) on  December , the local judicial body signed an agreement in which it undertook to bargain collectively with the complainant and the AEJBA; (ii) on  November , in violation of that agreement, the local judicial body signed a general collective labour agreement with the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA, two trade union entities without trade union status (personera gremial); and (iii) on  April , a meeting between the local judicial body, the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA was held in order to negotiate the wages and working conditions of the workers in question ?and that the complainant was denied entry on the grounds that it was not empowered to bargain collectively.
.The Committee also takes note of the local judicial bodys reply, which the Government forwarded, in which it denies that it discriminated against the complainant by excluding it and states that: (i) in the agreement of  December , it was envisaged that the signatories on the workers?behalf would be the two most representative trade unions in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; (ii) when the agreement of  December  was signed, the two most representative entities were the complainant and the AEJBA but by  November , when the collective labour agreement was signed, the complainant had lost that position and, as a consequence, the agreement was signed by the two trade unions that were the most representative at that time, the AEJBA and SINTRAJUCABA; (iii) the complainant is seeking to limit the participation of other trade union groups even though it functions locally as a sectional trade union; it is not and never has been registered at the local level; (iv) the local judicial body has always promoted trade union pluralism and since the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA are registered only at the local level and the complainant has trade union status only at the national level, it gave priority to the two trade union organizations that were most representative in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; and (v) it did not deny the UEJN entry to the meeting",-1,2014,Argentina
66,"held by the CMCABA, the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA on  April .
.In light of the foregoing, the Committee observes that the second allegation concerns the local judicial bodys decision to exclude the complainant from the negotiation and signing of its first collective agreement in favour of two other trade unions that the employer considered more representative at the time even though, the previous year, it had signed with the complainant an agreement stipulating that it would negotiate the collective agreement with the two most representative trade unions, namely the UEJN and the AEJBA?
.On this point, the Committee draws attention to the following background information: (i)at the time of the events, none of the trade unions had trade union status in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Bueno Aires, which, under Argentine general law and provincial ActNo. / ?which is applicable to this specific case ?is a condition for the entitlement to bargain collectively; (ii) according to the local judicial body, during the year that elapsed between the signing of the initial agreement with the complainant and the signing of the collective agreement with other organizations, a new trade union (SITRAJUCABA) was formed and rapidly achieved a membership far higher than that of the complainant; and (iii) the judicial bodys reply shows that the number of members of each of its three trade unions was calculated by its own Department of Human Resources.
.With regard to determination of the trade unions that are entitled to bargain collectively, the Committee recalls that where, under the system in force, the most representative union enjoys preferential or exclusive bargaining rights, decisions concerning the most representative organization should be made by virtue of objective and pre-established criteria so as to avoid any opportunities for partiality or abuse [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para.]. In this case, the Committee observes that in the absence of trade unions with trade union status, the local judicial body had no pre-established rules for identifying the most representative trade unions with which to negotiate collectively the collective agreement for the sector. The Committee also recalls that the determination to ascertain or verify the representative character of trade unions can best be ensured when strong guarantees of secrecy and impartiality are offered. Thus, verification of the representative character of a union should a priori be carried out by an independent and impartial body [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. While the Committee welcomes the signing of the first collective agreement in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, it requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future, identification of the representative trade unions with a view to negotiation of the collective agreement in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires is based on objective and pre-established criteria. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.
.The Committee takes note of the complainants?third allegation regarding several acts of interference in which the local judicial body is said to have given preference to the signatories of the collective agreement. In that connection, the complainant maintains that: (i) the two signatories were subsidized through contributions from the employer amounting to . per cent of the total wages paid to employees of the judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; (ii) by a decision of the President of the Council of the Judiciary, the employer was ordered to pay a supplement amounting to a percentage of the wages of the members of the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Labour Policy and Labour Relations, which is composed entirely of members of the signatory organizations; (iii) these organizations were granted private offices in buildings belonging to the judiciary; and (iv)each of the signatory entities?trade union representatives were granted ten hours of paid trade union leave per month.
.The Committee also takes note of the local judicial bodys reply, which the Government forwarded, in which the judicial body indicates that: (i) the so-called contribution pursuant to an agreement that the complainant mentions is an input pursuant to section  of the Trade Unions Act and its purpose is to fund cultural and social activities and support training plans that will benefit all staff members; (ii) the supplement paid to members of the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Labour Policy and Labour Relations is envisaged in section  of the Basic Legal Regime Governing Judges, Public Servants and other Employees of the Judiciary, adopted through Council of Ministers decision No. /, in Presidential decision No. /, and in section  of the collective labour agreement; (iii) the trade unions?offices and noticeboards are not for the exclusive use of the signatories since section  of the collective labour agreement does not specify their physical location, merely stating that they will be provided if the employer is able to do so, and the complainant has not requested them; and (iv) concerning the ten hours of paid leave, the time granted is proportionate to the representativeness of each group.
.With regard to the complaint regarding the advantages granted to two trade unions, the AEJBA and SITRAJUCABA, the Committee observes that these advantages arose from implementation of the collective agreement and from the fact that the signatory organizations are the most representative. The Committee refers to its previous conclusions regarding the need to ensure that in future, the verification of most representative trade union?status with a view to negotiation of the collective agreement in the judiciary is carried out by a body independent of the parties involved.
.The Committee takes note of the complainants?final allegation: that the formation of the trade union, SINTRAJU, and its subsidiary, SITRAJUCABA, in  was accompanied by favouritism by the then Minister of Labour and the then judiciary and by interference and persecution directed against the UEJN, including, among other things: (i) registration of SITRAJU by the Ministry of Labour in just four days; (ii) seizure of the data on the UEJNs hard drives; and (iii) unlawful diversion of , members of the UEJN by SITRAJU. While noting that the Government has sent no observations concerning these allegations, the Committee notes that they were presented quite briefly by the complainants, which did not provide details or evidence that would facilitate both the Governments response and the Committees examination. Under the circumstances, unless it receives additional details from the complainants, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to take measures adapted to national conditions, including legislative measures if necessary, to promote collective bargaining between judiciary authorities and the trade union organizations concerned and, in particular, to facilitate the adoption, in consultation with the various trade unions concerned, of the rules applicable to collective bargaining in this sector. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future, identification of the representative trade unions with a view to negotiation of the collective agreement in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires is based on objective and pre-established criteria. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.",-1,2014,Argentina
67,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the Single Trade Union of Port Administration Workers (SUTAP).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated November  and March .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , the complainant organization alleges that administrative action in  resulted in it being unlawfully deprived of the representative trade union status that had been conferred on it in  by Ministry of Labour Decision No. /. That decision had been appealed against by another union, the Railways Union (UF), and in  the Ministry of Labour issued new Decision No. / revoking Decision No./ and granting representative trade union status to the UF. SUTAP appealed against Decision No. / but the Ministry of Labour took  years to refer it to the judicial body, the National Labour Appeals Chamber (CNAT), without it being possible to ascribe that delay to the complainant. SUTAP also objects to the fact that there has still been no final judicial ruling on its claim for restitution of its representative trade union status.
.SUTAP alleges that under national law (section  of the Trade Unions Act) and also Article  of Convention No.  and the principles of freedom of association (specifically, the prohibition on suspending or dissolving organizations by administrative authority), the administrative authority had no power to revoke, cancel or suspend its representative trade union status and that such power belonged to the judicial body. Furthermore, the complainant alleges the lack of representativeness of the UF with regard to the workers employed by the port administration and indicates that in , citing the data contained in Decision No./ itself, SUTAP had a greater number of contributing members (more than  per cent more, a total of , compared with the UF total of ,).
.The complainant also objects that during the processing of its appeal the administrative file was mislaid, which damaged SUTAPs capacity to bring its claims before the judicial body. As a result, the judicial body was obliged in  to refer the proceedings back to the Ministry of Labour for verification of the size of the membership of both trade unions in a new period, with a view to then referring the proceedings to the judicial body for a ruling. After various attempts in which the UF was unable to submit the relevant documentary proof, the administrative authority referred the proceedings to the judicial body, which considered that the administrative authority had not satisfied the judicial request for verification, and hence it returned the file to the Ministry so that it could establish the number of contributing members of each trade union. The complainant states that it complied with the judicial request on  September  and that, as shown by the subsequent ministerial decision, SUTAP had a significantly greater number of contributing members (a total of , compared with  contributing members for the UF). However, on June  the judicial body again considered that the administrative authority had not completed the assigned task of verification. The administrative authority then issued a decision on October , stating that SUTAP had not supplied documentary proof of the number of its contributing members, despite having done so at two verification hearings. This administrative decision was contested in  by the complainant but no ruling had been issued on this challenge by the time the complaint was presented to the Committee.
.SUTAP denounces the fact that the proceedings for the restitution of its representative union status were obstructed by the irresponsible and negligent actions of the Ministry, which allegedly told the complainant informally that the file in question had been mislaid once again. The complainant considers that the Ministrys conduct violates the principles of freedom of association and infringes its right to due process, and requests the Ministry to submit the necessary information to the national labour justice system so that a ruling can be issued on the restitution of representative trade union status to SUTAP.
.In its communication of November , the Government states that the file in question was duly processed in a timely fashion and when the initial contents were mislaid in  the lost file was reconstituted by order. The Government indicates that the delays and the mislaying of the file were due to the fact that the administrative proceedings were referred to the judicial body several times, as a result of another claim being filed in connection with the recognition of the representative status of the trade union and the competent court having requested the documentation to be forwarded.
.In its communication of  March , the Government sent a copy of new administrative Decision No.  of  November , rejecting the complainants challenge to Decision No. /, which had revoked its representative union status in . The Government also indicates that it referred the proceedings to the judicial body, as demanded by SUTAP. Decision No.  of  summarizes the administrative and judicial proceedings that have taken place since representative union status was granted to SUTAP, including several hearings for the purpose of verifying its representativeness. Accordingly, the  decision refers to the administrative decision of  October , according to which SUTAP had been unable to duly certify the size of its contributing membership and the UF had a greater number of contributing members. The  decision, emphasizing that the substance of the issue was pending before the competent judicial body, specified that the proceedings were being referred back to the latter body.
.The Committee observes that SUTAP alleges that in  it was unlawfully deprived of its status as most representative trade union organization. As a result, SUTAP has filed a number of administrative and judicial appeals but its claims are still awaiting a judicial ruling. SUTAP states that on various occasions it gave proof of its numerical superiority with regard to the other trade union organization (UF) and that this has been reflected in ministerial decisions. Moreover, the Committee observes that the administrative decision of  October  considered that the complainant organization had been unable to duly certify the size of its contributing membership. The Committee notes that, notwithstanding the specific details of numerical superiority supplied by SUTAP in its allegations, the Government in its reply has not provided specific figures or details relating to representativeness for SUTAP and the UF, nor has it explained the precise reasons why the administrative authority considered that SUTAP was unable to certify its number of contributing members. The circumstances described and the excessive delay in the proceedings are, in the Committees view, unsatisfactory and incompatible with the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee also emphasizes that excessively long proceedings necessarily have to take account of changes in the membership levels of the organizations, thereby complicating the issue that needs to be resolved (namely, which of the two organizations is more representative).
.The Committee considers that where administrative decisions on the granting or revocation of most representative trade union status are challenged, the administrative and judicial proceedings need to take place without delay. The Committee notes with concern the delay of  years in the processing of the judicial appeal filed by the complainant against the revocation of its representative union status. The Committee is bound to reiterate the principle that justice delayed is justice denied [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. In this respect, the Committee notes with regret: () the mislaying of the file, with the resulting delays and harm caused; () the  years?delay on the part of the administrative authority in bringing the appeal before the judicial body, quite apart from the delay in fully complying with the judicial instructions received; and () the fact that the challenge to the administrative decision of  October , stating that SUTAP had been unable to duly certify its number of contributing members, was not settled by the competent administrative authority until  November , after the presentation of the complaint to the Committee. This being the case, the Committee firmly expects that the judicial proceedings concerning the claim for restitution of most representative trade union status to SUTAP will be concluded in the very near future and requests the Government to inform it of their outcome.
.The Committee also observes that there are other cases where it has already examined problems and delays similar to those described in the present complaint [see, for example, th Report, paras ?, or th Report, paras ?]. In view of this, the Committee invites the Government to ensure that proceedings for recognizing or challenging most representative trade union status are the subject of tripartite discussions with a view to improving their functioning and requests it to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard.
.As regards the complainants argument that the situation described",0,2014,Argentina
68,"(revocation of most representative trade union status) amounts to suspension or dissolution by the administrative authority, the Committee is bound to clarify that such an equivalence cannot be made. Indeed, the principle that measures of suspension or dissolution by the administrative authority constitute serious infringements of freedom of association does not appear to be applicable in this case since the revocation of most representative union status does not entail the suspension or dissolution of a trade union but a change in legal status, from most representative organization?to merely registered organization?(a status that applies to less representative organizations), which does not imply either loss of legal personality by the organization or loss of the right to defend the interests of its members, though it does mean loss of exclusive powers in the sphere of collective bargaining.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Deeply regretting the excessive delays in the processing of the appeal filed by the complainant organization, the Committee firmly expects that the judicial proceedings concerning the claim for restitution of most representative trade union status to SUTAP will be concluded in the very near future and requests the Government to inform it of their outcome.(b)	The Committee invites the Government to ensure that proceedings for recognizing or challenging most representative trade union status are the subject of tripartite discussions with a view to improving their functioning and requests it to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard.",2,2014,Argentina
69,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  September  from the Confederation of Municipal Workers of Argentina (CTM).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  October  and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the CTM alleges that workers in the municipal public administration have no scope for collective bargaining, in violation of Convention No. . The CTM argues that this lack of collective bargaining in the municipal administration is the result of the CTM being excluded from tripartite consultation and social dialogue. The CTM also alleges that the exclusion of municipal workers from the scope of the legal provisions governing labour relations and collective bargaining obstructs their access to the guarantees provided by minimum protection floors established by international labour standards. The CTM indicates that since it was established in December  it has unsuccessfully taken various actions and filed complaints with the municipal, provincial and national administrations with a view to establishing collective bargaining for workers in municipal administrations.
.In its communications of  May and  October  and  May , the Government states that it has not violated the provisions of Convention No.  and denies that municipal workers have in any way been excluded from the scope of the legal provisions governing labour relations or that any restriction has been placed on their access to the guarantees provided by minimum protection floors established by international labour standards. The Government observes that the complainant has not provided any details with regard to the municipalities where there is supposedly no collective bargaining. Furthermore, it emphasizes that, under the federal structure of the Argentine Republic, provinces and municipalities have a great deal of autonomy. Hence, the general complaint presented by the complainant comes within the scope of the autonomy of the municipalities. The Government also underlines the complexity of the communal structure of the country, which includes over , entities, and the multiplicity of forms that can be used to implement social dialogue, through collective agreements or other arrangements. The Government also refers to the Committees comments and those of the Committee of Experts concerning the need to find a fair and reasonable compromise between the need to preserve the autonomy of the parties in collective bargaining and the duty of the authorities to take the necessary steps to overcome budgetary difficulties. In view of the above, the Government considers that the complainant needs to specify the municipalities where the workers do not have access to collective bargaining. In contrast, as an example of social dialogue in the municipal sphere, the Government cites the experience of the province of Buenos Aires, the laws of which promote collective bargaining in the municipalities and grant powers to the ministerial authorities to facilitate the conclusion of agreements. In the aforementioned province, various municipalities have adopted the system of collective bargaining established by the provincial legislation. Lastly, the Government emphasizes its willingness to mediate in the institutional dialogues of the various federal collaborative bodies and to assist the municipalities that have not yet made use of any collective bargaining mechanisms, with a view to improving the application of Convention No. .
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges that workers in the municipal public administration have no scope for collective bargaining, in violation of Convention No. , and asks for collective bargaining to be implemented for workers in the municipal administration. The complainant considers that this lack stems from the CTM being excluded from tripartite consultation and social dialogue, despite the action it has taken and the complaints filed with the municipal, provincial and national administrations. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government denies that there has been any violation of Convention No.  or that municipal workers have in any way been excluded from the scope of the legal provisions governing labour relations, indicating that the issue raised in the complaint comes within the scope of the autonomy of the municipalities and stating that in order to address the allegations of the CTM it would be necessary to have details of the municipalities affected. The Government underlines as an example of social dialogue in the municipal sphere the experience of the province of Buenos Aires, referring to the provincial legislation that promotes collective bargaining in the municipalities and indicating that various municipalities in this province have adopted the legal system of collective bargaining.
.The Committee observes that collective bargaining in the local administrations is a reality at least in the case of the province of Buenos Aires and that the issues raised by the complainant appear to be limited to certain provinces. The Committee appreciates the Governments offer to facilitate collective bargaining in municipalities where it is not yet used and invites the Government to encourage dialogue between the provincial and municipal authorities, the CTM and the other most representative trade union organizations of public employees, with a view to promoting the full application of Convention No.  in its respective spheres. In this context, the Committee invites the complainant organization to provide more information to the Government on the municipalities where municipal employees have no access to collective bargaining. The Committee invites the Government to keep it informed of all progress made in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Appreciating the Governments offer to facilitate collective bargaining in municipalities where it is not yet used, the Committee invites the Government to encourage dialogue between the provincial and municipal authorities, the CTM and the other most representative trade union organizations of public employees, with a view to promoting the full application of Convention No.  in its respective spheres. The Committee invites the complainant organization to provide more information to the Government on the municipalities where municipal employees have no access to collective bargaining and invites the Government to keep it informed of all progress made in this regard.",0,2013,Argentina

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in October , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	As regards the alleged dismissal of Mr Christian Altamirano and Mr Roberto Funes on account of their affiliation to SLFZCTA, the Committee requests the Government to indicate the outcome of the ongoing legal proceedings.(b)	As regards the alleged suspensions for two or three days of the workers affiliated to the SLFZCTA for participating in direct action measures to protest against the dismissal of the workers affiliated to the SLFZCTA, in order to examine these allegations in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to indicate without delay the outcome of the investigations carried out by the administrative authority of the province of Buenos Aires and of the decisions adopted in this regard.(c)	As regards the allegation that, on  June , the union member, Mr Ricardo Rossi, was physically assaulted (suffering a triple jaw fracture and other injuries) on the company premises and that the union member, Mr Oscar Martnez, who went to his aid received death threats, the Committee deeply regrets these acts of violence and expects that the criminal proceedings referred to by the Government have resulted in timely investigations to determine responsibilities, prosecute and sanction the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar acts. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d)	As regards the complainants?allegations that the union member, Mr Rossi, has not received payment of his wages since the day on which he was assaulted (according to the complainants, the court ordered the payment of his wages but the company has not complied with the court order), the Committee urges the Government to ensure, without delay, compliance with the court order for the back payment of the wages owed to MrRossi and to keep it informed of any measures adopted in this regard.(e)	As regards the allegations that on  August  a dialogue process was initiated for a period of  days between the company and the SLFZCTA which, among other things, provided for the suspension of the effects of the dismissals, but that the company did not fulfil its commitments, the Committee requests the Government to inform it without delay of the outcome of the investigations carried out by the provincial administrative authority and of the decisions that have been adopted in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary measures to promote dialogue between the parties, with a view to achieving a harmonious industrial relations climate.
.In communications dated March and September  and October , the Government provided the following additional information.
.With regard to the allegations of dismissal of Mr Christian Altamirano and Mr Roberto Funes on account of their membership of the Light and Power Workers?Union of ZrateCTA (SLFZCTA), as well as the suspensions for two or three days of all workers belonging to the SLFZCTA for participating in direct action measures to protest against the dismissal of the members of their union, the Government reports that a general agreement was reached between the SLFZCTA and the electricity company, and that individual agreements were also reached between it and the workers who were members of the trade union, including Mr Altamirano and MrMartnez. The Government indicates that as a result of these agreements the dispute has been settled.
.With respect to the allegations of injuries inflicted on Mr Ricardo Rossi and the non-payment of his wages since the day on which he was assaulted, the Government states that this worker had not concluded an agreement with the company but that Criminal Court No.  of Campana handed down a conviction against the persons accused of the assault.
.The Committee recalls that this case concerns allegations of anti-union dismissals, suspensions of workers on account of their membership of the Light and Power Workers?Union of ZrateCTA (SLFZCTA) and their participation in industrial action, the physical assault of a trade unionist and death threats to a union member.
.With regard to the allegations of dismissal of Mr Altamirano and Mr Funes on account of their membership of the SLFZCTA, and suspensions for two or three days of all workers belonging to the SLFZCTA for participating in direct action measures to protest against the dismissal of the members of their union, the Committee notes that, according to the Governments report, agreements had been signed between the trade union and the company, and also between the company and the workers belonging to the union, and that as a result of these agreements the dispute had been settled.
.With regard to the allegations of an assault against Mr Rossi (and related allegations of death threats, for providing assistance, against Mr Martinez, a union member with whom the company had subsequently signed an agreement), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Criminal Court No.  of Campana handed down a conviction against the accused. The Committee expects that the judgment will have reviewed the various allegations made.
.With regard to the allegations of non-payment of Mr Rossis wages since the day on which he was assaulted, the Committee notes that the Government merely indicates that no agreement had been concluded between the company and the trade unionist. The Committee recalls that in its previous examination of the case it had noted that, according to the complainants, the court had ordered the payment of the trade unionists wages but the company had not complied with the court order. The Committee expects that the Government will take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the court order for the back payment of wages owed to Mr Rossi.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee expects that the Government will take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the court order for the back payment of wages owed to MrRossi.

The complainants add that Zrate Electricity and Related Services Cooperative Ltd was founded in  and is organized under the cooperative company regime.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the violations of freedom of association reported in this case arose from the conflict that began on  April  as a result of the discriminatory and anti-union dismissal of the workers Mr Christian Altamirano and MrRoberto Funes. According to the complainants, the workers received identical letters indicating that in view of your disobedience and refusal to comply with express work orders from your hierarchical superior, and the persistence of this behaviour in breach of your work duties, this administration considers that the continuation of our employment relationship is no longer feasible. Therefore, I hereby notify you of your dismissal on grounds of your exclusive responsibility.?According to the complainants, the text in question implies that they supposedly committed the same act of misconduct at the same time, which they consider to be practically impossible since both workers were posted in different sectors. According to the complainants, the text also failed to mention the orders that had not been carried out by the dismissed workers. The complainants allege that the dismissals occurred shortly after the workers in question communicated their decision to leave the Light and Power Workers?Union of the Paran Area and join the SLFZCTA.
.The complainants add that, as a result of the dismissals, the SLFZ workers decided to take direct action measures. They allege that when the industrial action began (stoppages for three or four hours followed by an open-ended strike), the company proceeded to suspend all the workers affiliated to the trade union for two or three days. The complainants indicate that the company carried out the aforementioned suspensions claiming that the workers?actions were politically motivated. The complainants also indicate that on  June , on the occasion of a national strike organized by the CTA, the workers affiliated to the SLFZ marched to the Zrate",1,2012,Argentina
71,"City Hall to submit a petition and request the Mayor to intervene to resolve the dispute. The complainants allege that on the same day at  p.m., after participating in the march, the union member, Mr Ricardo Rossi, was physically assaulted by two individuals ?one being the company coordinator of the department dealing with power restoration requests ?on the work premises, with the clear intention of killing him. Mr Rossi suffered a triple jaw fracture and other injuries. Moreover, the union member, Mr Oscar Martnez, who went to Mr Rossis aid, received death threats. The complainant organization also alleges that from the day that Mr Rossi was attacked, the company stopped paying his wages and although a court ruled in favour of the union members claims, the company refuses to comply with the court order.
.The complainants state that, on  August , the company agreed to initiate a dialogue process over a period of  days and it committed itself to the temporary suspension of the effects of the dismissals during the dialogue period and to guarantee, together with the trade union, faithful compliance with labour standards. The complainants allege that the company did not fulfil its commitments and that the workers, together with the trade union, requested precautionary measures and filed amparo proceedings to achieve the reinstatement of the dismissed workers. The complainants also state that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires was notified of all the actions carried out by the SLFZ, giving rise to a number of administrative proceedings, in the course of which labour inspections and inquiries were carried out. The complainants indicate that at the time the complaint was submitted, the administrative decisions regarding the violations committed by the company were still pending.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that the corresponding legal proceedings to obtain the reinstatement and back payment of the wages of the dismissed workers had been initiated and that criminal charges had been filed against the Director of the Cooperative for assault and injury.
.The Government adds that in the context of the dispute over the direct action measures and the subsequent negotiations, the provincial Ministry of Labour, on the request of the trade union, initiated the corresponding proceedings and carried out the requested inspections, as indicated by the complainants. Lastly, the Government states that the denounced acts have duly been referred to the corresponding judicial and administrative authorities, and in order to avoid unnecessary recourse to international jurisdiction, it requests that the complaint be set aside.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations allege the dismissal, on  April , of two workers (Mr Christian Altamirano and Mr Roberto Funes) from the company Zrate Electricity and Related Services Cooperative Ltd on account of their affiliation to SLFZCTA; that the company suspended for two or three days all the workers affiliated to SLFZCTA who participated in direct action (stoppages for three or four hours followed by an open-ended strike) to protest against the dismissals; and that on  June, on the occasion of the participation of SLFZCTA in the national strike organized by the CTA, the union member, Mr Ricardo Rossi, was physically assaulted (he suffered a triple jaw fracture and other injuries) on the company premises and that the union member, Mr Oscar Martnez, who went to his aid received death threats. The Committee also observes that the complainants report that union member, Mr Rossi, has not received payment of his wages since the day of his assault (according to the complainants the court ordered the payment of his wages but the company has not complied with the court order); that on  August , a dialogue process was initiated for a period of  days, which among other things, provided for the suspension of the effects of the dismissals, but the company did not fulfil its commitments and complaints were filed before the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires, giving rise to various administrative proceedings that are still pending decision.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of Mr Christian Altamirano and Mr Roberto Funes on account of their affiliation to the SLFZCTA, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that ?as the complainants have indicated ?the corresponding legal proceedings to obtain their reinstatement and the back payment of their wages have been initiated. In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the ongoing legal proceedings.
.As regards the alleged suspension for two or three days of all the workers affiliated to the SLFZCTA for participating in direct action measures to protest against the dismissals, the Committee observes that the Government declares that, in the context of the dispute over the direct action measures and the subsequent negotiations, the provincial Ministry of Labour, on the request of the trade union, initiated the corresponding proceedings and carried out the requested inspections. In these conditions, in order to examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to indicate without delay the outcome of the investigations carried out by the provincial administrative authority and of the decisions adopted in this regard.
.As regards the allegation that on  June , on the occasion of the participation of the SLFZCTA in the national strike organized by the CTA, the union member, MrRicardoRossi, was physically assaulted (suffering a triple jaw fracture and other injuries) on the company premises and that the union member, Mr Oscar Martnez, who went to his aid received death threats, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that criminal proceedings were filed against the Director of the Cooperative for assault and injury. In this regard, the Committee deeply regrets these acts of violence and expects that the criminal proceedings referred to by the Government have resulted in timely investigations to determine responsibilities, prosecute and sanction the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar acts. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed it in this regard.
.As regards the complainants?allegations that the union member, Mr Rossi, has not received payment of his wages since the day on which he was assaulted (according to the complainants, the court ordered the payment of his wages but the company has not complied with the court order), the Committee urges the Government to ensure, without delay, compliance with the court order for the back payment of the wages owed to MrRossi and to keep it informed of any measures adopted in this regard.
.As regards the allegations that, on  August , a dialogue process was initiated for a period of  days between the company and the SLFZCTA which, among other things, provided for the suspension of the effects of the dismissals, but that the company did not fulfil its commitments, the Committee notes that the Government reports that the provincial Ministry of Labour, on the trade unions request, initiated the corresponding proceedings and carried out the requested inspections. The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to inform it without delay of the outcome of the investigations carried out by the provincial administrative authority and of the decisions that have been adopted in this regard. In addition, observing that there have been initiatives to create dialogue opportunities between the company and the SLFZCTA, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to promote dialogue between the parties with a view to achieving a harmonious industrial relations climate.

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in October , the Committee made the following recommendations [see st Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the action for reconsideration with a subsidiary appeal which, according to the complainants, was brought against Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ ordering compulsory conciliation proceedings in a dispute in the Buenos Aires subway sector;(b)	The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ of  August  imposing the fine on the AGTSyP has been withdrawn;(c)	The Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay regarding the allegations that prosecutors (representatives of the Public Prosecutors Office) have filed complaints in relation to this dispute, which are ongoing, and that the Government City of Buenos Aires has applied to the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and the National Labour Court for the withdrawal of the legal personality of the AGTSyP.
.In its communications dated  November  and  May , the Government reports that it consulted the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour, Industry and Trade of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires, which indicated that no new claims had been made by the interested parties and that the problem had been resolved through new agreements.
.The Committee recalls that this case concerns a dispute in the context of the negotiation of certain working conditions and a salary adjustment for workers in the subway sector of the City of Buenos Aires. The Committee notes the indications by the Government that the problem has been resolved through new agreements. As regards Administrative DecisionsNos /SSTR/ (ordering compulsory conciliation proceedings) and /SSTR/ (imposing a fine on the AGTSyP and which, according to the Government, has not been served) the Committee requests the complainant organizations and the Government to indicate whether they are awaiting any administrative or court decisions in relation to these decisions and, if this is the case, to keep it informed of their outcomes. As regards the allegations that certain prosecutors had filed complaints in relation to this dispute and that the Government of the City of Buenos Aires is applying for the withdrawal of the legal personality of the AGTSyP, in view of the indications by the Government, unless the complainant organizations provide additional information in this regard, the Committee will not pursue the examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:As regards Administrative Decisions Nos /SSTR/ (ordering compulsory conciliation proceedings in the context of a dispute in the subway sector of Buenos Aires) and /SSTR/ (imposing a fine on the AGTSyP and which, according to the Government, has not been served) the Committee requests the complainant organizations and the Government to indicate whether they are awaiting any administrative or court decisions in relation to these decisions and, if this is the case, to keep it informed of their outcomes.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the Trade Union Association of Subway and Light Rail Workers (AGTSyP) and the Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA), dated  and  August , respectively.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  and  August , the AGTSyP and the CTA indicate that the AGTSyP is a first-level trade union for the workers of the Buenos Aires subway transport service. They also state that a concession of this public service was granted more than  years ago to a private company (Metrovas SA), which currently employs the workers represented by the AGTSyP. The complainants add that although the employer is a private company, its activities are regulated and directed by the State (the complainants are referring to the States transfer to the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires of the concession of the subway network of that city).
.The complainant organizations report that following the unsuccessful negotiation of certain working conditions under the collective agreement in force and of a salary adjustment request for , and the companys declaration that it was unable to meet the demands due to lack of funds, a strike was declared on  August and ran from  to  August .
.The complainant organizations indicate that in this context, a legislator of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires filed amparo proceedings before the courts and the judge ordered the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires (GCBA) to call the subway workers?representatives to negotiations with the company Metrovas SA, to enable both parties to reconcile their respective interests and thus bring an end to the dispute. According to the complainants, the courts decision did not mention the suspension of the exercise of the right to strike nor the application of the regime of compulsory conciliation. However, the complainants report that the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the GCBA issued Administrative Decision No./SSTR/ of  August , ordering the workers to abandon all direct action. The complainants indicate that AGTSyP lodged an action for reconsideration with a subsidiary appeal against the decision, under the local administrative procedural system.
.The complainants add that the AGTSyP appeared before the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the GCBA for negotiations on  August, at which time the negotiations resumed. On  August, it was indicated that the administrative labour authority of Buenos Aires was not an impartial body and should therefore not intervene in collective labour disputes involving subway workers. Notwithstanding, they expressed their willingness to proceed on the basis of voluntary participation, in line with the court decision, to find a solution to the dispute. The complainants also state that immediately after issuing Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/, which has been the subject of various appeals, the Buenos Aires authorities issued Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ of August , imposing a fine of ,, Argentina pesos (ARS) on AGTSyP for non-compliance with Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ and with the compulsory conciliation proceedings. According to the complainants, confirmation of this fine would result in the economic liquidation of the trade union. Likewise, the complainants add that public prosecutors have filed complaints, which are ongoing, and that the GCBA has applied to the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and the National Labour Court for the withdrawal of the legal personality of the AGTSyP.
.In its communication dated September , the Government transcribes the main parts of the reply sent by the GCBA. It indicates that National Decree No. / granted the concession for underground passenger rail services for the City of Buenos Aires to the company Metrovas SA. The workers at the enterprise belong to two trade union associations: the Automotive Tramway Union (UTA), which is a first-level trade union association with legal personality (in other words, in keeping with Act No.  concerning trade union associations, one of its exclusive rights is the right to participate in collective bargaining) and the AGTSyP, which is an association that is simply registered. It recalls that section  of Act No.  provides that collective agreements concluded with a trade union association with legal personality are governed by the provisions of the Act and section  provides that the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security is the authority responsible for implementing the Act.
.The Government adds that during the years of coexistence of the UTA and AGTSyP trade union associations, the authority responsible for the implementation of collective agreements, and in the event of collective labour disputes, has been the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. According to the Government, in the context of negotiations between the parties, a collective dispute arose on  August  and the AGTSyP specifically requested the intervention of the administrative labour authority of the GCBA. The Government indicates that through its own actions the AGTSyP has recognized the authority of the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the GCBA.
.The Government states that irrespective of the request made by the AGTSyP, the intervention of the administrative authority of the GCBA occurred in accordance with the legal decision handed down by Administrative and Tax Court No.  of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires in the case of Lubertino Beltrn and Mara Jos v. GCBA and others regarding protection of constitutional trade union rights (amparo). The officiating judge ordered the Office",1,2012,Argentina
74,"of the Undersecretary of Labour of the GCBA to convene the subway workers?representatives to negotiations with the company to enable both parties to reconcile their respective interests and thus bring an end to the dispute. On  August  the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour was informed of the legal ruling and in compliance with the ruling it convened all the parties to a hearing. Following seven hours of intense debate, the meeting concluded and the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour ordered compulsory conciliation through Administrative Decision No./SSTR/ in order to resolve the conflict.
.The Government states that under this procedure an agreement was concluded between the UTA (trade union association with legal personality) and the enterprise, which consisted of an increase in the basic salary on the salary scale, in line with the definitive conditions to be agreed. The Government states that the AGTSyP did not comply with the compulsory conciliation and instead continued the industrial action for a period of ten days. Consequently, and in accordance with the powers vested in it under the law (Act No. ), the administrative authority issued Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/, imposing on the trade union association the legally stipulated fine. The Government notes that the fine was not enforced. The Government stresses that the administrative labour authority, in issuing Administrative Decision No./, did not stipulate the provision of minimum services, but underlined in its whereas clauses the critical importance of the subway and light rail service. Lastly, the Government states that it is clear that the administrative labour authority of the GCBA acted in conformity with the prevailing legislation, with the instructions of the officiating judge and with the request made by the AGTSyP.
.The Committee observes that, in this case, the complainant organizations indicate that following the unsuccessful negotiation of certain working conditions and of a salary adjustment for workers in the subway sector of the City of Buenos Aires, a strike was declared and held from  to  August , and that although the courts only ordered the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the GCBA to summon the subway workers?representatives to negotiations with the representatives of the company Metrovas SA with a view to putting an end to the conflict, the administrative authorities exceeded their remit and issued Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ of  August  ordering the workers to abandon all industrial action. The Committee also notes that the complainant organizations allege that, although the AGTSyP filed administrative appeals against the abovementioned decision, and appeared before the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the GCBA under the abovementioned framework of negotiations on  August ?indicating that it did not consider that the administrative labour authority of the City of Buenos Aires was an impartial body and should therefore not intervene in disputes ?resuming negotiations at that time, the authorities of the City of Buenos Aires issued Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ of  August , imposing a fine of ARS,, on the AGTSyP for non-compliance with Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ and the compulsory conciliation proceedings (in addition, according to the complainants, public prosecutors have filed complaints on these grounds, which were ongoing, and the GCBA has applied to the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and the National Labour Court for the withdrawal of the legal personality of the AGTSyP).
.As regards the challenged summons to compulsory conciliation proceedings of the parties to the dispute (the company Metrovas SA and the AGTSyP) under Administrative DecisionNo. /SSTR/ (the AGTSyP did not consider that the administrative labour authority of the City of Buenos Aires was an impartial body), the Committee notes the Governments statement that the GCBA indicated that: (i)the workers at the enterprise belong to two trade union associations: the UTA, which is a first-level trade union association with legal personality (in other words, in keeping with Act No.  concerning trade union associations, one of its exclusive rights is the right to participate in collective bargaining) and the AGTSyP, which is an association that is simply registered; (ii) during the years of coexistence of the UTA and AGTSyP, the authority responsible for the implementation of collective agreements and in the event of collective labour disputes has been the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security; (iii) in the context of the negotiations between the parties, a collective dispute arose on  August  and the AGTSyP specifically requested the intervention of the administrative labour authority of the GCBA; (iv) through its own actions the AGTSyP has recognized the authority of the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the GCBA; (v) irrespective of the request made by the AGTSyP, the intervention of the administrative authority of the GCBA occurred in accordance with the legal decision handed down by Administrative and Tax Court No.  of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires in the case of Lubertino Beltrn and Mara Jos v. GCBA and others regarding protection of constitutional trade union rights (amparo); (vi) the officiating judge ordered the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the GCBA to convene the subway workers?representatives to negotiations with the company to enable both parties to reconcile their respective interests and thus bring an end to the dispute; (vii)on  August , the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the GCBA, in order to comply with the order handed down by the judicial authority, convened all the parties to a hearing and following seven hours of intense debate the meeting concluded and the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour ordered compulsory conciliation through Administrative Decision No./SSTR/ in order to resolve the conflict; (viii) under this procedure an agreement was concluded between the UTA (trade union association with legal personality) and the enterprise; and (ix) the AGTSyP did not comply with the compulsory conciliation and instead continued the industrial action for a period of ten days.
.Recalling that a decision to suspend a strike for a reasonable period so as to allow the parties to seek a negotiated solution through mediation or conciliation efforts, does not in itself constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ], the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the action for reconsideration with a subsidiary appeal which, according to the complainants, was filed against Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ ordering compulsory conciliation proceedings.
.Furthermore, with respect to Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ of August , imposing a fine of ARS,, (approximately US$,) on AGTSyP for non-compliance with Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ and with the compulsory conciliation proceedings, the Committee observes the statement by the GCBA that: (i) the AGTSyP did not comply with the compulsory conciliation and instead continued the industrial action for a period of ten days; (ii) consequently, and in accordance with the powers vested in it under the law, the administrative labour authority imposed on the trade union association the legally stipulated fine; (iii) the fine in question was not enforced. In this respect, the Committee recalls, in a general manner, the importance of sanctions in the event of failure to observe the legal requirements for a strike (which are in conformity with the principles of freedom of association) being commensurate with the transgression in question, and requests the Government to indicate whether the administrative decision imposing the fine has been withdrawn.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay regarding the allegations that prosecutors (representatives of the Public Prosecutors Office) have filed complaints in relation to this dispute, which are ongoing, and that the GCBA applied to the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and the National Labour Court for the withdrawal of the legal personality of the AGTSyP.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the action for reconsideration with a subsidiary appeal which, according to the complainants, was brought against Administrative Decision No./SSTR/ ordering compulsory conciliation proceedings in a dispute in the Buenos Aires subway sector.(b) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether Administrative Decision No. /SSTR/ of  August  imposing the fine on the AGTSyP has been withdrawn.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay regarding the allegations that prosecutors (representatives of the Public Prosecutors Office) have filed complaints in relation to this dispute, which are ongoing, and that the GCBA has applied to the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and the National Labour Court for the withdrawal of the legal personality of the AGTSyP.",-1,2012,Argentina
75,".The complaint is contained in communications of the General Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina (CGTRA) dated  August . The CGTRA presented new allegations in a communication dated  December .
.The Government provided its observations in communications dated October  and March .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  August , the CGTRA indicates that it is presenting a complaint against the Government for the violation of Convention No.  in the context of the procedure for the renewal of its officers, who were elected on  July  for a period of four years (July  to  July ), in accordance with its statutes. The complainant reports that the process of the renewal of its officers was undoubtedly the most pluralistic, democratic and transparent undertaken in recent years by the Confederation. The electoral process, initiated by the meetings of the executive council of  March and  April , in accordance with the procedure set out in the statutes, was also approved by the Central Committee of the Confederation on  May that year.
.The complainant indicates that, first, with regard to the quorum set out in the by-laws, the extraordinary general congress was constituted and  first-level organizations were affiliated. Then, in constant compliance with the precautionary measures and requirements set out in the by-laws, and to prevent gaps and interruptions in terms of office, the ordinary congress envisaged by the statutes was held for the renewal of the officers of the Confederation. The complainant emphasizes that over , participants at the congress, through a direct and secret ballot, elected the leadership of the CGTRA for a period of four years. The CGTRA alleges that the Government interfered in this electoral process, in violation of freedom of association and the independence of trade unions, and particularly the right to elect representatives in full freedom. According to the complainant, the interference extended to the highest levels of the executive authorities, which not only made public their preferences for candidates other than the secretary-general of the National Federation of Truck Drivers and Workers in the Road Transport of Loads, Logistics and Services (FNTCOTACLS), who was elected to guide the destiny of the Confederation, but also took the form of specific pressure on leaders and affiliates to withdraw their support. According to the CGTRA, this situation was denounced both before and after his re-election as secretary-general. The complainant adds that, despite the multiple requests made for a meeting, the President of the Nation did not receive the secretary-general.
.The CGTRA claims that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security does not have the competence to intervene in the intra-union conflict in the Confederation, as the procedure set out in the Act respecting trade unions has not been exhausted (the complainant is referring to section , which provides that without prejudice to the provisions of the statutes, the provisions of the previous section shall apply to disputes which may arise between affiliates of a trade union association of workers and the latter, or between a lower-level and a higher-level association? In this regard, section provides that: Before referring issues of trade union governance to the administrative authorities, the associations concerned shall have first exhausted the remedies available within the association, through a decision of the union organization of the level higher than the organization to which they are affiliated, or to which their federations are affiliated?. According to the CGTRA, the administrative authorities remedied weaknesses in the challenges made by the group of leaders who described themselves as being close to the Government, with the clear intention of intervening in and undermining the electoral process in the CGTRA. Accordingly, the independence of the organization was violated, in breach of its statutes and of jurisprudence, which has reiterated on numerous occasions that issues relating to trade union elections, particularly in the case of the most important trade union confederation in the country, shall be determined by the judicial authorities or an independent mediator without the intervention of the public authorities.
.The complainant adds that the administrative decision of  July , which concluded that a sufficient and valid quorum had not been reached for the meeting of the executive council of the CGTRA on  April , and that its procedure and decisions were therefore null and void, and that the same body has to be reconvened to confirm the decisions taken or a new electoral process organized for the renewal of the officers? was drawn up prior to the meeting of the extraordinary congress of the Confederation on July . The CGTRA adds that only a few minutes after the arbitrary and unlawful decision referred to above had been issued, the authorities of the Ministry held a press conference in which they announced in public the decision taken by the Ministry, even though no final decision had been taken on the appeals that were before the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations, or the appeal to the higher authority that was to be decided by the Minister. The administrative action implied a political decision by the authorities to intervene in the election for the renewal of the officers of the CGTRA.
.In its communication of  December , the CGTRA alleges that the national Government is persisting in the unlawful and arbitrary acts of disqualification and interference in the life of the organization, thereby demonstrating a clear anti-union policy against the secretary-general, Hugo Antonio Moyano, as well as against other unions. The complainant reports that acts of vandalism and looting broke out in the provinces of Ro Negro, Santa Fe and Buenos Aires on  and  December , and that shortly after the looting began, as if the Government were pursuing a policy of persecution, government officials brought criminal charges against the trade union leaders Hugo and Pablo Moyano for a general strike called by the FNTCOTACLS. Even though the charges were set aside, the administrative labour authorities imposed a very heavy fine (of over  million pesos), without guaranteeing the right of legitimate defence. That decision has now been sent back to the labour administration, as Chamber X of the National Labour Court of Appeal found that the Minister of Labour had not complied with the necessary administrative procedures. According to the complainant, it can clearly be seen that the Government has a history of defamation and criminalization of union leaders that are critical of its action. The complainant also alleges that on  December  the authorities of the Ministry of National Security accused Hugo Moyano and Pablo Micheli of excesses which resulted in two fatal victims, and that the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers of the National Government implicated various unions. In this case, the public statements gave rise to a forceful riposte from the workers?movement in a press conference, in which it was emphasized that the purpose of the defamation through the press was clearly to intimidate union leaders who were engaged in a plan of action to combat the Governments economic and social policy.
.In its communication of October , the Government denies each and every denunciation contained in the complaint and reaffirms that the claims are false and reckless. The Government emphasizes that it is not a question of partiality, but that the Ministry of Labour acted in defence of international guarantees which had objectively been prejudiced through failure to comply with clear statutory provisions, and which resulted in the exclusion of the representatives of important organizations from the executive council of the CGTRA. The claim that international standards have been violated is therefore unfounded. Indeed, on the contrary, the Ministry of Labour acted in defence of the principles of freedom of association and of international treaties against those infringing them.
.The Government totally refutes the accusation that the States action amounts to a violation of Articles  and  of Convention No. , and reaffirms that the Ministry acted at the request of one party whose international and constitutional guarantees had been prejudiced, through what may be summarized as violations of the right of expression, equality before the law and the exercise of the right to vote. In other terms, it was an objective case of exclusion of union representatives of affiliates from the leadership of the CGTRA, in a context of politicization of the electoral process, in which one party had the intention of taking over the leadership of the CGTRA for its own political purposes, irrespective of the objectives of the Confederation, as set out in its statutes, and even in violation of international provisions respecting union activities. The Government provides a transcription of the report of the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations (file No. / of  July ), which indicates that it is examining an application for the absolute and irrevocable invalidation of the meeting of the executive council of the CGTRA",0,2012,Argentina
76,"which approved the convening of the Central Committee of the Confederation on  May  and the ordinary and extraordinary national congresses on  July . The application was lodged by various unions, which claimed that the executive council did not on that occasion achieve the necessary quorum for the meeting to be valid, in accordance with clause  of the statutes. It adds that various participants at the meeting did not fulfil the statutory requirements to represent their respective unions. Investigation showed that the quorum was not reached at the meeting of the executive council of the CGTRA on April , which could not therefore be considered valid, resulting in the procedure and the decisions taken by the meeting being null and void, with the need for the same body to meet again to confirm its decisions or a new electoral procedure to be held for the renewal of the officers.
.The Government recalls that in the present case the complainant was not acting as a mere association, but that during the electoral period it exercised jurisdictional functions, such as resolving the intra-union differences relating to the election process (section  of Act No.) and in the executive council, safeguarding the whole electoral process and guaranteeing impartiality, transparency and objectivity. However, the very terms in which the complaint is couched illustrate the lack of awareness of the role that has to be played by the officers of a union during an election. Those who exercise institutional responsibility during ballots have to demonstrate an impartial attitude, irrespective of the positions that are adopted during the campaign. The conduct of the complainant was in breach of the principles of impartiality and transparency?in two respects: first, the use of the machinery of the Confederation in support of a specific position during the process, and second the disqualification of opponents. The Government adds that the statutes of the CGTRA set out clearly that the union organizations represented on the executive council are those which elect representatives to the executive council through their constituent bodies, and that this requirement was not met. The facts are clear in this respect, and none of the six candidates who stood in the absence of the real members of the executive council produced any documentation from the organizations they claimed to represent, as required by the statutes of the Confederation. In other words, there were six persons without any documentation in support of their presence as members of the executive council, as required by the statutes of the CGTRA. The Government observes that the dispute which arose in the CGTRA first had to be addressed within the Confederation through the establishment, in accordance with sections  and  of Act No. , of an ad hoc tribunal for that purpose, which would discharge jurisdictional functions within the competence of the State. In so doing, the union is under the obligation to comply with the constitutional guarantees and the provisions of international treaties. The Government adds that the complaint reveals a lack of respect?for rivals, with the continual disqualification of representatives of sectors that could be seen as dissident by the leadership of the faction wishing to convene an election. Dissidence should not be considered to be an attack justifying the disqualification of those concerned from standing in the election.
.The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour took action at the request of one of the parties. A series of union organizations requested the Ministry to do so on the grounds of a flagrant violation of the organizations statutes. The Government reaffirms that the Ministrys action is legitimized by virtue of two sets of rules: international public labour law and international labour standards. The Ministry of Labour took action under legitimate circumstances, because there were violations of the principles governing the building of a common position in an association, the disqualification of opponents, breaches of the rules of due process, as well as of democratic rules and other guarantees of the exercise of freedom of association. According to the Government, this is fully borne out by the findings of the report of the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations in case No. /. The Government provides details of the actions of the complainant which were identified as void and wrongful: () the violation of clauses, (e) and  of the by-laws through failure to comply with the requirements for the formal convening of ordinary and extraordinary national congresses, including those intended for elections to renew the officers of the CGTRA; () the violation of trade union independence by preventing the contesting organizations, which were members of the executive council, from nominating their representatives for the meeting of  April , in breach of clauses  and  of the statutes; () a discriminatory attitude, by challenging the complaint lodged by the contesting organizations through a specific statement dismissing their claims prior to the beginning of the process at the union headquarters ?sections  and  of Act No. ; and () the failure to convene correctly the Central Committee of the Confederation on  May  and the ordinary and extraordinary congresses, set for  July . The situation as a whole makes it difficult to validate an election process.
.The Government adds that at all times the Ministry of Labour endeavoured to ensure compliance with existing requirements, as illustrated by the meeting held in the Ministry of Labour, but without success. The lack of agreement during the meeting convened by the Ministry demonstrated political conduct which perverted the electoral process, by seeking to impose requirements that were in breach of natural individual and union safeguards, as the politicization of the statutory governance bodies, in the middle of an electoral process, prevented it from being considered objective and transparent. The Government indicates that in reality the complainant was endeavouring to take over the electoral process for its own political ends.
.The Government reports that the intra-union dispute is currently before the courts, to which the action taken by the administration has been referred. The case is before ChamberV of the National Labour Court, entitled: Ministry of Labour v. Armando Cavalieri et al., Secretaries-General of union organizations affiliated to the CGTRA, under the Act respecting trade unions, Case No. /. This means that oversight over the action taken by the administration is being exercised by the courts, which are the appropriate instances to safeguard the interests of the parties, and the courts will decide on the relevance, merits and legality of the action taken by the Ministry.
.In its communication of  March , the Government refers to the latest allegations made by the complainant organization in December . The Government points out that although the complainant refers to the events which occurred on  and  December , those were actually the outcome of a process which started earlier and is, as already mentioned, characterized by blockades, pickets and intimidation of all kinds. As pointed out by some newspapers dated  June , the truck drivers?union ?which is part of the set of unions that the complainant organization claims to represent ?ordered a work stoppage of  hours in the fuel distribution sector, and was, in light of the circumstances, requested to immediately cease industrial action, as also reported by the newspapers. In addition to ignoring the mandatory conciliation, the union in question proceeded to block several production plants or fuel distributors. According to the Government, the State was subjected in this context to ongoing acts of violence endangering the lives and safety of persons, and, as a result of this situation, the Government initiated two lawsuits over these incidents which are pending before the courts. The Government further states that, as noted by the newspaper reports, a fine was imposed on the union for ignoring the mandatory conciliation during the dispute, and the related judicial proceedings are also ongoing. On  November , industrial action was taken once again in the form of pickets and blockades of all entries of the city of Buenos Aires. These circumstances led to the measures adopted in December mentioned by the complainant. The events of December are the consequence of a constant and recurring performance of acts of threats for sixmonths, and the statement of the public officials must be understood in that context.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant alleges that the administrative authorities interfered in the electoral procedures of the General Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina (CGTRA), which were carried out in compliance with the statutory procedure, resulting in the election on  July  of new officers for a period of four years (the complainant organization objects to the intervention of the administrative authorities, which found that the quorum had not been reached in the executive council of the CGTRA and decided that the council should be reconvened to confirm the decisions taken or a new election procedure organized). The Committee also observes the allegation by the CGTRA that: () the interference extends to the highest level",-1,2012,Argentina
77,"of the executive authority and is not limited to public expressions of preference for a candidate but also consists in placing pressure on trade union leaders and affiliated organizations; and () the government authorities engaged in conduct intended to invalidate and interfere in the activities of the organization, thereby demonstrating a clear anti-union policy against the secretary-general, Hugo Moyano, and other leaders (according to the CGTRA, criminal charges were brought against Hugo and Pablo Moyano for calling a general strike decided upon by the National Federation of Truck Drivers and Workers in the Road Transport of Loads, Logistics and Services (FNTCOTACLS) in December  and, even though the criminal charges were set aside, a very heavy fine, amounting to over  million pesos, was imposed by the administrative authorities).
.With regard to the allegation of interference by the administrative authorities in the electoral process of the CGTRA (the complainant criticizes the intervention by the administrative authorities which found that the quorum had not been reached in the executive council of the CGTRA and decided that the council should be reconvened to confirm the decisions taken or a new election procedure organized), the Committee notes the Governments statements that: () the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security acted in defence of international guarantees which had objectively been prejudiced through failure to comply with clear statutory provisions, and which resulted in the exclusion of the representatives of important organizations from participation in the executive council of the CGTRA; () the action taken by the Ministry was at the request of one of the parties in light of violations of international and constitutional guarantees, which may be summarized as the violation of the right of expression, equality before the law and the exercise of the right to vote; () it was an objective situation involving the exclusion of representatives of unions from the leadership of the CGTRA; () the Ministry of Labour took action under legitimate circumstances, as there were violations of the principles governing the building of a common position in an association, the disqualification of opponents, breaches of the rules of due process, as well as of democratic rules and other guarantees of the exercise of freedom of association; and ()the intra-union dispute is currently before the courts, to which the action taken by the administration has been referred (the case is before Chamber V of the National Labour Court, under the title of: Ministry of Labour v. Armando Cavalieri et al., secretaries-general of unions affiliated to the CGTRA, under the Act respecting trade unions), and it is the court that will decide on the relevance, merits and legality of the action taken by the Ministry of Labour. While noting all this information, the Committee recalls that:The right of workers?organizations to elect their own representatives freely is an indispensable condition for them to be able to act in full freedom and to promote effectively the interests of their members. For this right to be fully acknowledged, it is essential that the public authorities refrain from any intervention which might impair the exercise of this right, whether it be in determining the conditions of eligibility of leaders or in the conduct of the elections themselves.Measures taken by the administrative authorities when election results are challenged run the risk of being arbitrary. Hence, and in order to ensure an impartial and objective procedure, matters of this kind should be examined by the judicial authorities.
.With regard to the new allegations of December , according to which the Government authorities engaged in acts of disqualification and interference in the activities of the organization, thereby demonstrating a clear anti-union policy against the secretary-general, Hugo Moyano, and other leaders (according to the CGTRA, criminal charges were brought against Hugo Moyano and Pablo Moyano for a general strike called by the FNTCOTACLS in December , and even though the criminal charges were set aside, the administrative authorities imposed a very heavy fine, amounting to over  million pesos, which is before the administrative authorities), the Committee notes that the Government indicates that: (i) the events which occurred on  and  December  were the outcome of a process characterized by work stoppages in the fuel distribution sector as well as pickets, blockades and intimidation, which started earlier; (ii) on  June , the truck drivers?union called for a work stoppage of  hours in the fuel distribution sector, and was, in light of the circumstances, requested to immediately cease industrial action; (iii) in addition to ignoring the mandatory conciliation, the union in question proceeded to block several production plants or fuel distributors, and the State was subjected to ongoing acts of violence endangering the lives and safety of persons; (iv)as a result of this situation, the Government initiated two lawsuits over these incidents which are pending before the courts, and a fine was imposed on the union for ignoring the mandatory conciliation during the dispute, with the related judicial proceedings also ongoing; and (v) the events of December  are the consequence of a constant and recurring performance of acts of threats for six months, and the statements of the public officials must be understood in that context. Under these circumstances, highlighting the delay in the ongoing proceedings relating to the events of , the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the relevant judicial proceedings.
.Lastly, regarding the allegations concerning the authorities?interference by publicly expressing their preference for candidates participating in the CGTRAs election process, as well as the pressures and threats to leaders and affiliated organizations, the Committee notes that the Government states that it is not a question of partiality and that the Ministry of Labour acted in defence of international guarantees which had been prejudiced and due to the breach of CGTRAs statutory requirements. In that regards, the Committee recalls that in general when the authorities intervene during the election proceedings of a union, expressing their opinion of the candidates and the consequences of the election, this seriously challenges the principle that trade union organizations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom?[see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Recalling the importance of respecting the principles concerning the non interference of the authorities in trade union elections mentioned in the conclusions, the Committee firmly expects that the judicial authorities will rule without delay on all the pending matters relating to the electoral process in the CGTRA. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the ongoing judicial proceedings initiated on the grounds of the events occurred during the general strike called by the National Federation of Truck Drivers and Workers in the Road Transport of Loads, Logistics and Services (FNTCOTACLS) in December , as well as of the outcome of the judicial proceedings concerning the imposition of a fine on the FNTCOTACLS, for not having complied with the mandatory conciliation in the framework of the relevant dispute.",3,2012,Argentina
78,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated April  from the Confederation of Argentine Educators (CEA) and the Santiago Circle for Secondary and Higher Education (CISADEMS). The CEA and CISADEMS sent new allegations in relation to the complaint in a communication dated June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of April , the CEA and CISADEMS state that CISADEMS is in the process of filing claims for a wage review and for the elimination of irregular payments with the Subsecretariat of Labour of the Province of Santiago del Estero. They allege that when several hearings prior to the dispute yielded no results and the decision to strike was subsequently taken, the Subsecretariat of Labour issued repeated resolutions calling for compulsory conciliation. According to the complainant organizations, in every dispute, conciliation is ordered at the request of the Ministry of Education. Hearings for compulsory conciliation are always scheduled between ten and  days after the strike called by the trade union organization and where the measure of force used is declared illegal. A solution was never found owing to a lack of proposals from the employers. Furthermore, the compulsory conciliation process is never exhausted (the complainants refer to different administrative proceedings since ). The complainants state that they are the victims of an unfair practice whereby the abusive exercise of the powers derived from Act No.  concerning compulsory conciliation impedes the exercise of trade union rights, while the Subsecretariat of Labour becomes both the judge and interested party by ruling on a dispute involving a body that is part of the provincial executive, which violates the principles of due process and, in so doing, the international instruments that refer to the right to defence and to a natural judge.
.The complainant organizations add that, in accordance with Act No.  (Educational Funding Act, which lays down, together with Decree No. /, the framework agreement for collective bargaining in the education sector), in February , federal government representatives, which included the provincial education authorities in their entirety (including the Province of Santiago del Estero), the national authorities and trade union representatives from teachers?associations with trade union status and a field of activity that extended to the whole Argentine Republic (CISADEMS was represented by the CEA), met to bargain collectively. The complainants state that, on this occasion, the parties agreed to set a minimum wage for teachers, whose basic wage could not fall below  per cent of the minimum wage set in that sector throughout the country.
.In their communication of June , the complainant organizations refer to cases of compulsory conciliation that took place in the sector in  and .
.In its communication of February , the Government states that the provincial authorities have not intervened or violated any trade union rights. The Government states that the information from the Secretariat of Labour of the province regarding the establishment of a round table, and the provincial authoritys constant efforts to reach out to trade union organizations, support the above statement. The Government adds that, according to the provincial authority, a working group was created to deal exclusively with the provincial education system. In accordance with the law, the working group was subsequently divided up into specific institutional spaces, which led to the creation of the round table on education, among others. According to the information provided by the provincial authority, CISADEMS did not participate in that round table of its own accord.
.The Government also sends a communication from the Secretariat of Labour of the government of the Province of Santiago del Estero relating to the complaint. The provincial authority indicates that the Secretariat of Labour has been granted ministerial status as a result of the amendment to the Ministries Act. It states that there are no collective disputes with any trade union organization in the province, be it regarding wages or any other problems that could affect social dialogue or industrial peace. It also states that the province has undergone changes in all areas, including industry and production, as well as social inclusion policies, for which reason it worked to consolidate institutional spaces for dialogue and consensus. In this context, the relevant legal instruments were drawn up and the round tables with the organizations that are members of the General Labour Confederation (CGT) and with other unions that are unrelated to that trade union centre (the education sector, farmers?associations and security councils) were established. Consequently, with a view to tackling the problems in the education sector, a working group was set up in  to deal exclusively with the current situation of the provincial education system. The working group was created to deal specifically with issues relating to the educational sphere and was composed of all legally established trade union entities. The only organization that did not participate in the round table for debating and discussing the trade union, social and legislative aspects of the problems relating to the area in question was CISADEMS. The provincial authority states that it has worked with the remaining entities for the benefit of all workers and students of the province and that the complainant organization also benefited despite not having participated or contributed useful ideas. The provincial authority indicates that the dialogue highlighted the need to expand the scope of the discussion and, consequently, the provincial executive, through Decree No. , extended the round table to other state and private trade union sectors, which led to the decision to divide up the areas for discussion and debate. At the express request of the CGT (delegation of Santiago del Estero), Act No.  was promulgated which institutionalized the round table on dialogue and labour. In order to place a greater focus on the problems of each trade union institution, the following spaces for institutional dialogue were created: (a) the round table on dialogue and labour; (b) the round table on education; (c) the round table on land and production; and (d) the Economic and Social Council. The provincial authority adds that the provincial executive appointed the trade unions affiliated with the CGT, together with the Chief of the Cabinet, as the coordinators responsible for regulating the functioning of the Act and, to date, they have laid down regulations for the round table on education and the round table involving the state. The provincial authority states that the adoption of these norms has facilitated the participation of structures that are neither political nor related to trade unions but which deal with social problems such as those related to land, farmers and religious associations. The provincial authority states that, in the province, trade unions are part of a single confederation, the CGT, Santiago del Estero branch, which is composed of a total of  trade unions. Moreover, the provincial authority states that the complainant organization, CISADEMS, does not participate in the spaces for dialogue of its own accord.
.The provincial authority states that the authority competent to deal with collective disputes in Santiago del Estero is the Subsecretariat of Labour. The Subsecretariat prepared a report relating to the complaint (this report gives details of the action taken by the complainant organization CISADEMS before the administrative authority of the province, including its request for hearings with the provincial government to deal with claims for wage increases and other issues relating to the interests of its members; the dates on which CISADEMS strikes were scheduled; and the resolutions that led to compulsory conciliation). The provincial authority adds that, as regards the alleged incompetence of the Subsecretariat of Labour of the province in dealing with the cases referred to in the complaint, it should be noted that the Province of Santiago del Estero signed an agreement with the Government aimed at jointly determining how the provision of administrative services would be shared between the national and provincial authorities in the employment sector in an integrated and harmonious manner. This is aimed at strengthening and promoting the autonomous functioning of the provincial governments in the full exercise of labour enforcement powers, which include monitoring full compliance with labour legislation, particularly that referring to working conditions and working environment, and to the resolution of individual or collective disputes. Furthermore, the provincial authority states that the provinces of Argentina are members of the Federal Labour Council, which sets all labour related standards in the country.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege that as part of various disputes over wage-related claims made by CISADEMS between  and , the authorities of the Province of Santiago del Estero ?which are involved in the dispute ?issued resolutions calling for compulsory conciliation for the sole purpose of impeding the exercise of the right to strike, while failing to formulate proposals for examining agreements.
.The Committee takes note of the Governments statement to the effect that the provincial authorities",0,2012,Argentina
79,"have not intervened or violated any trade union rights. Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government sends a communication from the Secretariat of Labour of the provincial government of Santiago del Estero indicating that: () there are no collective disputes with any trade union organization in the province, be it regarding wages or any other problems that could affect social dialogue or industrial peace; () the province has undergone changes in the areas of industry and production, as well as social inclusion policies, for which reason it worked to consolidate institutional spaces for dialogue and consensus; () in this context, round tables with the organizations that are members of the CGT and with other unions that are unrelated to this trade union centre (the education sector, farmers?associations and security councils) were established and, in , with a view to tackling the problems in the education sector, a working group was set up to deal exclusively with the current situation of the provincial education system; ()the working group was created to deal specifically with issues relating to the educational sphere and was composed of all legally established trade union entities. The only organization that did not participate in the round table for debating and discussing the trade union, social and legislative aspects of the problems relating to the area in question was CISADEMS; () the provincial authority has worked with the remaining entities for the benefit of all workers and students of the province and the complainant organization also benefited, despite not having participated or contributed useful ideas; () at the express request of the CGT (delegation of Santiago del Estero), to which, according to the provincial government,  trade unions are affiliated in the province, Act No.  was promulgated which institutionalized the round table on dialogue and labour and the round table on education, among others; () the complainant organization CISADEMS does not participate in the spaces for dialogue of its own accord; () the authority competent to deal with collective disputes in Santiago del Estero is the Subsecretariat of Labour, which prepared a report relating to the complaint (this report gives details of the action taken by the complainant organization CISADEMS before the administrative authority of the province, including its request for hearings with the provincial government to deal with claims for wage increases and other issues relating to the interests of its members; the dates on which CISADEMS strikes were scheduled; and the resolutions that led to compulsory conciliation); and () as regards the alleged incompetence of the Subsecretariat of Labour of the province in dealing with the cases referred to in the complaint, it should be noted that the Province of Santiago del Estero signed an agreement with the Government aimed at jointly determining how the provision of administrative services would be shared between the national and provincial authorities in the employment sector in an integrated and harmonious manner, which includes monitoring full compliance with labour legislation, particularly that referring to working conditions and working environment and to the resolution of individual or collective disputes. However, the Committee takes note of the complainant organizations statement to the effect that it participated, represented by the CEA, in the collective bargaining that took place between federal government representatives and trade union representatives, during which the parties agreed to set a minimum wage for teachers. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the Governments statement to the effect that the complainant organization CISADEMS does not participate in the round tables set up in the province of its own accord, the Committee invites the complainant organization to consider joining the spaces established for dialogue and, in particular, the round table on education.
.Furthermore, as regards compulsory conciliation, the Committee recalls that it has had to examine several cases from Argentina involving objections to orders for compulsory conciliation between the parties to a dispute in the public education sector by the administrative authority, when the latter was a party in the dispute. In this regard, the Committee recalls that the intervention of a neutral, independent third party, in which the parties have confidence, may be enough to break a stalemate resulting from a collective dispute, which the parties cannot resolve by themselves, and reiterates that it is necessary to entrust the decision of initiating the conciliation procedure in collective disputes to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute [see th Report, Case No. , para. ; nd Report, Case No. , para. ; and th Report, Case No. , para. ]. The Committee once again requests the Government to take the necessary measures, including legislative measures if required, to that end and thus bring the legislation and practice into conformity with Conventions Nos  and . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee reiterates that it is necessary to entrust the decision of initiating the conciliation procedure in collective disputes to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute and once again requests the Government to take measures, including legislative measures if required, to that end, thus bringing the legislation and practice into conformity with Conventions Nos  and . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b)	The Committee invites the complainant organization CISADEMS to consider joining the spaces for dialogue established in the Province of Santiago del Estero and, in particular, the round table on education.",5,2012,Argentina
80,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) dated  September .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated September , the CTA states that it is presenting this complaint against the Government of Argentina for serious violations of freedom of association and the rights of workers?organizations and representatives guaranteed under Conventions Nos  and  and Resolution No.  adopted by the International Labour Conference in , in the form of arbitrary detentions, repression by the state security forces using firearms, anonymous attacks, persecution and police harassment.
.The CTA states that in recent years in the sugar industry a process of reorganization and trade union growth has been under way of the bodies that represent the workers in the various enterprises in the sector, predominantly located in the provinces of Jujuy, Salta and Tucumn. One of the most powerful enterprises in the sugar industry is the Ledesma Refinery.
.According to the CTA, job insecurity, little regard for rights, high accident rates and abysmal wages were the determining factors that prompted a process to strive for change and to a series of actions led by trade unions in the sugar sector aiming to put an end to decades of being undermined. The deployment of these actions of self-protection triggered an immediate reaction by the employers in the form of various actions and reprisals against both the actions and the activists and repression by the state authorities, carried out by their security forces.
.The CTA adds that in this context, in the Province of Jujuy, on  July  four workers were murdered and a further two were seriously injured during the violent eviction carried out by state law enforcement officers, and possibly by private security guards hired by Ledesma Refinery, of over  workers and their families who were occupying a hectare site owned by the enterprise in Libertador General San Martn in the Province of Jujuy. In the same operation another  people participating in the occupation were arrested.
.The CTA states that most of the workers are members of both the Class Combat Movement, a social and trade union organization made up of employed and unemployed workers, and also of the CTA. The occupation of the site had been organized by the Class Combat Movement as a way of increasing visibility in order to obtain a response from the Government regarding the achievement of a fundamental right: access to decent housing.
.The CTA alleges that during these incidents, Mr Carol Lenides Sosa, social action secretary of the Trade Union of Ledesma Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees, affiliated to the CTA (SOEACTA), and vice-president of the benevolent fund for staff at the Ledesma Refinery, elected on  June , was unjustifiably arrested by police when, during the clashes, he left his house to ask that no more tear gas be used against the occupiers or his home. Following his arrest he was moved to the Calilegua police station and held with other detainees, all accused of committing common crimes. No charges were brought against the official. The judicial complaint into the case lodged by the CTA is being heard as Case No. ./ and is under the responsibility of Judge Jorge Samman. But at the time of his arrest and during all the repressive measures, it was Judge Carolina Prez Rojas who was responsible for the criminal court to which application was made for the release of the official, which was systematically refused and then only agreed to following  hours under entirely unlawful arrest.
.The CTA adds that Fernando Daniel Arias, representative of the trade union group Grey List, which won in the elections of  June  held at the Trade Union of Ledesma Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees, affiliated to the CTA (SOEACTA), was a targeted victim of police repression on  July . According to the CTA, Mr Arias was singled out by police, approached by the officers and shot in the leg with a lead projectile. MrArias had to be operated on in a clinic in the city of San Pedro de Jujuy to remove a lead bullet, which has been seized by the criminal court to be used as evidence. The complaint is being heard under the same Case No. ./, and is also under the responsibility of Judge Jorge Samman, before Criminal Court No. , Registry No.  of the Judicial Centre of San Pedro de Jujuy, in the Province of Jujuy.
.The CTA also alleges that on  August , at approximately  a.m., Jos Mara Castrillo, union secretary of the Trade Union of La Esperanza Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees, affiliated to the CTA (SOEACTA), had two hit men fire shots at him, using weapons of different calibres, in front of his home in the city of San Pedro de Jujuy. At least six shots were fired, two of which entered the house, where the official and his family were located. The CTA adds that Mr Castrillo is an important social representative of the Sugar Trade Union, a trade union activity that he has been involved in for many years with irreproachable conduct and major achievements in defence of workers?rights. His conduct and actions in defence of workers?rights constitute a threat to certain economic interests consolidated by reproducing archaic systems of worker exploitation and which are without a doubt linked to the cowardly action of carrying out a furtive attack on his home, endangering his life and the lives of his family, making them a target of trade union violence. The attack was reported to the police authorities (police file No. /), and is being heard by Criminal Court No. , Registry No.  of the Judicial Centre of San Pedro de Jujuy, in the Province of Jujuy. According to the CTA, it is a matter of concern that the judge that is hearing the case is Judge Carolina Prez Rojas (who is responsible for the court in question), as she was the one to order the eviction and repression that occurred on  July  from land belonging to the Ledesma Refinery, during which four workers were murdered by police and security guards contracted by the enterprise that owns the land.
.The CTA also alleges that on Tuesday,  October, at approximately  a.m., unknown individuals, across a railing separating Mr Castrillos home from the public footpath, managed to set fire to a motorbike of low cylinder capacity which the official uses to go to work and to carry out his union activities; the vehicle was a write-off. The legal case for this offence is also before Court No. . The CTA indicates that up until the time the complaint was lodged there has been no news on the investigation into the two attacks against the trade union official Mr Castrillo and his family.
.The CTA notes that it is universally accepted that it is not possible to exercise freedom of association without the full and unrestricted enjoyment of human rights. The assurance of the practical effectiveness of freedom of association necessarily requires the full application of the guarantees of civil rights and public freedoms. It is for this reason that the CTA believes that the anonymous attacks, the arbitrary detentions and the armed suppression of trade union officials from the unions in the sugar sector, as reported, constitute actions deployed or tolerated by the state authorities, intended to obstruct the proper exercise of freedom of association and of the other rights associated with it. This being the case, the institutional response afforded by the social rule of law can be no other than to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for planning and perpetrating the serious incidents referred to in the complaint.
.The CTA states that the history of impunity that exists in the face of state and semi-official repression targeting social and trade union officials does not inspire it with optimism with regard to the true commitment of the Government of Argentina to effectively address the cases in question. Consequently it is necessary to lodge all relevant complaints at both the national and international levels in order to obtain the minimum guarantees essential for the exercise of the activities and other rights involved in freedom of association. According to the CTA, the repression used by the Government of Argentina has violated both the freedom of association of the persecuted officials, and the rights of freedom of expression, due process and physical integrity, seriously affecting the protections established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
.Lastly, the CTA highlights that both the characteristics of the specific allegations being referred to in the complaint and the context of the suppression of social protest in which they occurred lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Governments true aim is to silence",0,2011,Argentina
81,"the voices of dissent, thereby quite simply stifling workers?freedom of expression and limiting the full enjoyment of the rights emanating from freedom of association.
.In its communication dated May , the Government sent the reply communicated by the Director-General of the Labour Directorate of Jujuy Province on the complaint in question.
.The authorities of the Provincial Labour Directorate of Jujuy Province state the following:(a)Events that took place in Libertador General San Martn on  July According to the media, on  July  approximately  families, with the support of a political organization called Class Combat Movement (CCC), under the command of the leader of the CCC of Jujuy, Enrique Kike?Mosquera, illegally occupied land belonging to the enterprise Ledesma S.A.A.I., located on the El Tringulo?site, of an area of approximately  hectares, in the vicinity of the sugar refinery owned by the company. Following the occupation, Ledesma S.A.A.I. initiated criminal proceedings before Criminal Court No.  at the Judicial Centre of San Pedro, Judicial Authority of the Province of Jujuy which, after authorizing the peaceful clearance of the land, finally ordered the eviction to be carried out on  July ; this was done by Ms Carolina Prez Rojas, who replaced the judge when he went on leave. On  July , in compliance with the court order, police officers appeared at the site at . a.m. For reasons that are under judicial investigation, Alejandro Farfn died after being shot in the neck, and three other people, Ariel Farfn, Flix Reyes and Vctor Heredia, were wounded. Dr Roberto Maizel at the hospital Oscar Orias in the nearby city of Libertador General San Martn, said that at least  people, including ten police officers, received treatment for a variety of injuries caused by lead bullets, rubber bullets and stones. The situation caused in Libertador General San Martn led to several arrests and a political and social crisis which led to the resignation of the government minister and of the provincial police chief, and to the suspension of internal elections in the Justicialist Party and the Radical Civic Union, scheduled for Sunday,  July . As a result of these events judicial proceedings were initiated which are still in progress.(b)Events causing injury to Jos Mara CastrilloOn  August , at approximately . a.m., shots were fired at the home of Jos Mara Castrillo, union secretary of the Trade Union of La Esperanza Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees, located in the city of San Pedro de Jujuy, Province of Jujuy, allegedly by two hit men according to newspaper sources. The corresponding criminal proceedings were initiated in view of these unlawful acts and the judicial inquiry is currently before National Criminal Investigation Court of First Instance No. , Registry No.  of the Judicial Centre of San Pedro de Jujuy, in the Province of Jujuy.Explanatory introductionTurning to the ethical issues relating to the above events, I again consider that both should be dealt with differently as they relate to situations that are substantially different from the point of view of prevailing regulations.(a)Events that took place in Libertador General San Martn on  July It should first of all be noted that the Government of Argentina is currently investigating these events in order to clarify the facts, identify those responsible and, as appropriate, assess the degree of responsibility to be attributed to the protagonists; consequently it is too early to give any opinion on this matter at present, as it is only when the facts have been clarified that it will be possible to make an assessment.With this proviso, as far as these events are concerned I consider that there is currently nothing to suggest anything akin to alleged trade union persecution or the hampering of freedom of association and the right to demonstrate and act in defence of workers?rights, that could be considered as violating ILO Conventions Nos  and , at least according to the information currently available, without prejudice to the judicial inquiry under way.The regrettable events that led to the deaths and injuries occurred in the context of an occupation of private land by a group of people, currently under investigation, in other words to date there is no evidence that they were acting collectively in defence of the rights of workers at the refinery or of any other trade union interests.The regrettable consequences of the events under examination do not undermine the premise of application of the Conventions invoked by the complainant, that is to say the exercise of the rights of association and collective bargaining for the purpose of defending workers?interests.Acting in support of labour causes is the reason for and the substance of the organization and activities of trade unions. The instruments that the complainant is presenting to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO for consideration protect the free exercise of this right from being tampered with or obstructed.Article  of ILO Convention No.  provides that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment ...?It is clear that the material sphere of application of this international standard presupposes claims made by a workers?organization seeking to protect trade union interests because the authentic defence of the collective rights of workers are being jeopardized; what is being legally protected is freedom of association as a means of ensuring the effective implementation of standards that protect labour law.This dual dimension, both individual and collective, which is being jeopardized in the right to associate for relevant purposes?as stipulated in Article  of the National Constitution, was expressly recognized by the Supreme Court of Justice in the recent decision handed down in the case the Association of State Workers v. the Ministry of Labour regarding the Act on Trade Union Associations? On that occasion the High Court indicated: ?.. the progressive development of the regulation of the right of association, already provided for in the National Constitution of ? (Art. ), highlighted the dual order of essential aspects contained in it, which, to the same extent, are essential to shed light on the case. On the one hand, it revealed the two interlinked dimensions associated with this right: individual and social. On the other, it warned of the specificity of the right of association in the trade union sphere, giving rise to the consolidation of so-called freedom of association ...?(point ).The Supreme Court, in the above decision, refers specifically to these safeguards necessary for the democratic and peaceful development of these freedoms, in accordance with the judicial decisions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the case of Huilca Tecse v. Peru (Case of Huilca-Tecse v. Peru, merits, reparations and costs, judgment of March , Series C, No. , para. ). In this respect it holds that: ?.. the whole human rights corpus iuris highlights the content of the right to freedom of association and its two inseparable dimensions: individual and social? According to the judgment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the terms of Article . of the American Convention establish literally?that those who are protected by the Convention not only have the right and freedom to associate freely with other persons, without the interference of the public authorities limiting or obstructing the exercise of the respective right, which thus represents a right of each individual? but they also enjoy the right and freedom to seek the common achievement of a licit goal, without pressure or interference that could alter or change their purpose.It then emphasizes ?.. Furthermore, in various ways the international instruments cited established, in the far-sighted manner provided in Article bis, specific spheres of freedom of association. Thus, Article  of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stipulated the right of trade unions to function freely subject to no limitations other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?According to the information currently available, no trade union organization was citing labour rights of any kind when the security forces intervened.The court order was limited to clearing some occupied pieces of land, and did not involve monitoring, let alone suppressing, a trade union demonstration. With regard to the arrests, these occurred in a context of resistance to the court order, and as such the State cannot be blamed for having arrested people who were actively involved in the conflict. Moreover, the arrests are a result of the regular exercise of the polices powers when dealing with unlawful acts and there are no elements to suggest that their status as trade union representatives had anything to do with the arrests of the people in question.The complainants acknowledge that the arrest of Mr Carol Lenides Sosa was unrelated to his position as social action secretary of the Trade Union of Ledesma Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees or to his role in defence of labour rights, but was rather due to the fortuitous circumstance",1,2011,Argentina
82,"that his house is situated next to the area where the clashes were taking place and the fact that he went outside to ask the police to stop using tear gas.Consequently I consider that the complaint is not justified on this point as this is not a case of coercive restriction of the free exercise of associational activities or activities in the defence of workers.In addition, it should be noted that no direct responsibility can be attributed, at least until the judicial investigation has been completed, to the Government of Argentina, for the unfortunate events that took place on  July , especially in view of the fact that many of the provinces police officers were wounded and one died as a result of a gunshot wound, so caution is called for in this regard.(b)Events causing injury to Jos Mara CastrilloWith regard to the criminal acts carried out against the union secretary of the Trade Union of La Esperanza Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees (SOEA), it must first be determined whether these events are related to his union activities, but it is reasonable to suspect that there might be a link.This possibility should be viewed in the context of internal struggles within the SOEA, which should be taken into account when assessing the situation.It is common knowledge that since  the trade union in question has been facing internal divisions, which were leaked to the public and resulted in the dismissal of union representatives, including Mr Castrillo, and accusations being made among the members of the executive committee, which in turn led to them presenting themselves to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security under file No. / and all resigning from their posts on  May , to call new elections in the following months, with an electoral standardizing delegate being appointed to oversee the trade union elections.Whereas in the case of the events of  July  the Government of Argentina was accused of being responsible for alleged trade union persecution on the basis of an unproven appraisal, given that there is no indication of the existence of trade union activities and neither is it clear that any repressive actions were taken by the security forces, in the case of the violence against Mr Castrillo, no direct intervention can be attributed to the Government of Argentina, as in any case it relates to a criminal act being committed against Mr Castrillo, who at the time was a trade union official, by unidentified individuals.However, even if we advance the hypothesis of alleged indirect state responsibility in the guarantee of protection it owes its citizens, particularly in respect of trade union activities, it is also both premature and unfounded to accuse the Government of Argentina, as a judicial inquiry is under way in an attempt to clarify the facts, which have rightly been characterized as criminal and which are being dealt with as such.The scourge of crime is a reality that is being tackled throughout the world and the Government cannot be implicated just because these offences occur, provided that the Government ensures that they are prosecuted and punished through legal and constitutional channels.Beyond the real possibility that Mr Castrillo is indeed being persecuted because of his activities in defence of the collective interests of his colleagues, the fact is that the Government cannot be held responsible for these unlawful attacks while it is acting as it has been doing, putting its resources and energy into pursuing criminal prosecution for these actions.Consequently I consider the injustice reported by the complainants on this matter to be unfounded, as the conduct of the public bodies has been irreproachable in respect of the offences suffered by Mr Castrillo.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the CTA alleges that the following acts of violence occurred during a period of unrest and the implementation of a series of actions by trade unions in the sugar sector aiming to put an end to decades of being undermined: (i) the murder of four workers (a further two were seriously injured) during the violent eviction of over  workers who were demanding decent housing on a  hectare site on the Libertador General San Martn facility in the Province of Jujuy, carried out by state law enforcement officers on  July ; (ii) the arrest during these violent clashes of MrCarol Lenides Sosa, social action secretary of the Trade Union of Ledesma Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees, for  hours (without any charges being brought against him); (iii) an attack by the police using firearms directed at Fernando Daniel Arias, a representative of the same union; and (iv) a firearms attack in the early hours of the morning on the home in the city of San Pedro, Province of Jujuy, of trade union official Jos Mara Castrillo, union secretary of the Trade Union of La Esperanza Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees on  August  (the trade union official and his family were at home) and the burning of a vehicle belonging to the trade union official (at his home) on  October  in the early hours of the morning.
.The Committee observes, in respect of the allegations, that the Government has sent the reply of the Provincial Labour Directorate of Jujuy Province.
.Concerning the allegations relating to the death of four workers and the injuries suffered by two workers during a violent clearance of a site occupied by workers who were demanding decent housing, the Committee notes that the provincial administrative authority has indicated that: (i) the events are being investigated to clarify the facts, identify those responsible and, as appropriate, assess the degree of responsibility to be attributed to the protagonists; consequently it is too early to give any opinion on this matter at present, as it is only when the facts have been clarified that it will be possible to make an assessment; (ii) there are currently no elements suggesting anything akin to alleged trade union persecution or the hampering of freedom of association, the right to demonstrate and act in defence of workers?rights, that could be considered as violating ILO Conventions Nos  and , at least according to the information currently available, without prejudice to the judicial inquiry under way; (iii) the regrettable events that led to the deaths and injuries occurred in the context of an occupation of private land by a group of people, currently under investigation, in other words to date there is no evidence that they were acting collectively in defence of the rights of workers at the refinery or of any other trade union interests; and (iv) according to the information currently available, no trade union organization was citing labour rights of any kind when the security forces intervened, and the court order was limited to clearing some occupied pieces of land, and did not involve monitoring, let alone suppressing, a trade union demonstration.
.With regard to the alleged detention, during the violent incidents mentioned in the previous paragraph, of Carol Lenides Sosa, social action secretary of the Trade Union of Ledesma Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees, for  hours (without any charges being brought against him), the Committee notes that according to the provincial administrative authority, the complainants themselves acknowledge that his detention was unrelated to his status as social action secretary of the Trade Union of Ledesma Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees or to his role in defence of labour rights, but was instead due to the fortuitous circumstance that his house is situated next to the area where the clashes were taking place and the fact that he went outside to ask the police to stop using tear gas. The Committee requests the complainant to indicate whether they agree with this assertion. The Committee notes nevertheless that according to the complainant, this was the object of a complaint which is being heard (case No. ./).
.Concerning the alleged firearms attack by the police, during the violence on  April , targeting Fernando Daniel Arias, a representative of the same union, the Committee observes that neither the Government nor the provincial administrative authority have sent their observations on the matter, but that the complainant organization says that these have been reported and that it lodged a complaint which is being heard as case No../ before Criminal Court No. , Registry No.  of the Judicial Centre of San Pedro de Jujuy, in the Province of Jujuy.
.With regard to the alleged firearms attack in the early hours of the morning on the home in the city of San Pedro, Province of Jujuy, of trade union official Jos Mara Castrillo, union secretary of the Trade Union of La Esperanza Refinery Sugar Workers and Employees on  August  (the trade union official and his family were at home) the provincial administrative authority states that: (i) according to newspaper sources, the shots were fired at the home of the union secretary by two hit men; (ii) the corresponding criminal proceedings were initiated in view of these unlawful acts and the",1,2011,Argentina
83,"judicial inquiry is currently before National Criminal Investigation Court of First Instance No. , Registry No.  of the Judicial Centre of San Pedro de Jujuy, in the Province of Jujuy; (iii) it must be determined whether these events are related to his union activities, but it is reasonable to suspect that there might be a link; moreover, this possibility should be viewed in the context of internal struggles within the union, which should be taken into account when assessing the situation; (iv) it is common knowledge that since  the trade union in question has been facing internal divisions, which were leaked to the public and resulted in the dismissal of union representatives, including Mr Castrillo, and accusations being made among the members of the executive committee, which in turn led to them presenting themselves to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and all resigning from their posts on  May , to call new elections in the following months, with an electoral standardizing delegate being appointed to oversee the trade union elections; (v)in the case of violence against Mr Castrillo, no direct intervention can be attributed to the Government of Argentina, as in any case this relates to a criminal act being committed against Mr Castrillo by unidentified individuals and it is both premature and unfounded to accuse the Government of Argentina as a judicial inquiry is under way in an attempt to clarify the facts, which have rightly been characterized as criminal and which are being dealt with as such; (vi) the scourge of crime is a reality that is being tackled throughout the world and the Government cannot be implicated just because these offences occur, provided that the Government ensures that they are prosecuted and punished through legal and constitutional channels; (vii) beyond the real possibility that Mr Castrillo is indeed being persecuted because of his activities in defence of the collective interests of his colleagues, the fact is that the Government cannot be held responsible for these unlawful attacks while it is acting as it has been doing, putting its resources and energy into pursuing criminal prosecution for these actions; and (viii) the conduct of the public bodies has been irreproachable in respect of the offences suffered by Mr Castrillo.
.The Committee deplores the gravity of the allegations, the alleged deaths, acts of violence and detentions. It recalls that on previous occasions when examining allegations relating to acts of violence it has stated that in the event of assaults on the physical integrity of individuals, the Committee has always considered that an independent judicial inquiry should be instituted immediately with a view to fully clarifying the facts, determining responsibility, punishing those responsible and preventing the repetition of such acts [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee observes that judicial inquiries are under way in respect of the violent acts committed in the Province of Jujuy on  July  in which four workers died and the trade unionist Fernando Daniel Arias was injured, and of the firearms attack on the home of trade union official Jos Mara Castrillo on August . The Committee notes that the administrative authority of the Province of Jujuy is questioning the anti-union nature of the violent acts committed on  July  and has provided information concerning an intra-union dispute in respect of the acts of violence suffered by Mr Castrillo.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government: () to communicate the outcome of the judicial inquiries relating to the violent acts committed on  July  in the Province of Jujuy in which four workers died and the trade unionist Fernando Daniel Arias was injured, and to the firearms attack on the home of trade union official Jos Mara Castrillo on  August ; and () to inform it whether a judicial inquiry has been opened into the alleged burning of a vehicle belonging to trade union official Jos Mara Castrillo (at his home) on  October  in the early hours of the morning and, if so, to report on the outcome.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to communicate the outcome of the judicial inquiries relating to the violent acts committed on  July  in which four workers died, the trade unionist Fernando Daniel Arias was injured, and following which Mr Carlos Lonides Sosa was detained, as well as to the firearms attack on the home of trade union official Jos Mara Castrillo on  August .(b)	The Committee requests the Government to inform it whether a judicial inquiry has been opened into the alleged burning of a vehicle belonging to trade union official Jos Mara Castrillo (at his home) on  October  in the early hours of the morning and, if so, to report on the outcome.(c)	The Committee draws the Governing Bodys attention to the serious and urgent nature of this case.",1,2011,Argentina
84,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  from the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Judicial Federation of Argentina (FJA).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and May.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention, , (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  June , the CTA and the FJA indicate that they submit a complaint against the Government of Argentina for violation of Conventions Nos  and.
.The complainants indicate that, currently, at the national level as well as in the vast majority of the provinces, judicial workers in Argentina are neither guaranteed the right to collective bargaining nor protected by a collective agreement. Indeed, judicial workers in Argentina have never enjoyed this right nor benefited from any such agreement. They point out that the right to collective bargaining is being denied to workers who do not exercise acts of public authority, but who, within the various judicial services, provide administrative and management tasks and services, and in general, any service supporting the operation of courts of justice at the national and provincial government levels.
.Moreover, except in four provinces (Crdoba, Santa Cruz, Neuqun and Mendoza) out of  and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the right to collective bargaining has never been enforced, nor have collective bargaining agreements been concluded in the rest of the country, especially at the national level. Joint committees are operational in only two of these four provinces ?Santa Cruz and Neuqun ?whereas this right is denied in Crdoba and Mendoza. Moreover, even at the national level, the State Government has neither recognized nor ensured the right to collective bargaining, nor has any collective labour agreement ever been concluded for judicial workers.
.This complete absence of collective bargaining ?with the few exceptions noted above ?and particularly the absence of any collective agreement for judicial workers at the national level as well as in most of the provinces, is accompanied by intense unilateral activity of the governments at the national, provincial and Autonomous City of Buenos Aires levels moving towards determining salaries, wages and all other working conditions which should result from collective bargaining. In other words, the employer imposes its conditions, with workers being limited to the fate of their accession contract, without the possibility for engaging in any collective discussion.
.The complainants note that during the  legislative session, the House of Deputies of Argentina approved a draft national law on the right to collective bargaining for all judicial workers, which set out a procedure for negotiation and a system for the provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires to adhere to this procedure with a view to establishing a common national scope, without prejudice to collective bargaining at the autonomous or federal levels. Nevertheless, after being submitted to the Senate, and in spite of having been dealt with in committees, the Senate did not take action on the draft law, which subsequently lapsed in December . Consequently, there is no legal framework governing the collective bargaining of the judicial sector.
.The complainants note that the Government has failed to meet its obligations under ILO standards, especially its obligation to enforce and comply with ILO Convention No.  which the Government of Argentina ratified through Act No.  in . In accordance with paragraph (d) of article  of the ILO Constitution, once a member State has ratified a Convention, it must take such action as may be necessary to make effective the provisions of such Convention? Thus, in accordance with its obligation as under the provisions of the Convention, the Government must guarantee the right to collective bargaining of public service workers, including those in the judiciary.
.The complainants note that when a right is recognized under an international treaty, it is enforceable even in the absence of domestic regulation, all the more so when the right in question is recognized under the National Constitution. In that regard, the complainants maintain that the State of Argentina remains in violation of its obligation to guarantee collective bargaining rights to judicial workers by failing to take the necessary measures to ensure the effective implementation of such rights. Assuming that the federal authorities do not consider this matter to fall under their remit, the complainants note that: (a) firstly, as mentioned above, a member States obligations extend beyond the submission and subsequent ratification of an international standard; (b) in addition to ratification, it must take all the necessary measures to implement the international standard; (c) these measures include: (i) those relating to the workers under their (federal) jurisdiction, and, (ii) those relating to the workers in other jurisdictions who have the same right; and, (d)consequently, the obligation under international law refers to all those to whom the standard is intended without exception.
.The complainants note that the Government has not taken any measure to guarantee the right to collective bargaining of judicial workers at the federal level (for example, by adopting a national Parliament act to that end, or establishing itself directly or indirectly as the employer in any negotiation). According to the complainants, there is no valid reason or justification for the State of Argentina to continue to fail to comply with its collective bargaining obligations with regard to the administration of justice in its various jurisdictions.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government forwards the response of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (CSJN). According to the Government, the Courts response states that the Framework Act Regulating National Public Employment No.  is not applicable, because it excludes judiciary staff from its specific scope, setting out that such staff is governed by a special rule (article ), and there is thus no gap in domestic law. Therefore, for the Court, the scope of Convention No.  on collective bargaining in the public sector (which Argentina ratified in a timely manner) does not cover Argentinas judiciary staff.
.The CSJN states the following in relation to the complaint:?for the purpose of this complaint, the judiciary is placed on equal footing with the public sector or public service with a clear aim of imposing the conclusion of collective agreements, following the wording of ILO Conventions, which specifically refer to public service??the claim that the judiciary of Argentina is an integral part of its national public service is clearly unfounded, since the judiciary is vested with the authority to exercise judicial oversight over the latters activities, following the principle of the separation of powers of a federal and republican State;?thus, the Framework Act Regulating National Public Employment No.  has specifically excluded Argentinas judiciary staff from its scope ?which includes collective bargaining (article ) ?stipulating that this staff is governed by a special rule (article ), and there is thus no gap in domestic law;?the complaint lacks specific evidence of wrongs on which to base the claim of effective violations of the rights of judicial workers, indicating a possible lack of understanding of their actual professional status, or the intentional disregard thereof;?thus, it fails to recognize that these workers enjoy the same policy of privileges and exemptions as judges and public officials (Decree No. /), except as regards the latters professional incompatibilities (articles  and  of the Rules of the national justice system), and, like them, their income is guaranteed under a system of self sufficiency, characteristic of the national judiciary (Act No. ). Thus, in exercising its powers, the Court has made no hierarchical distinction between employees or the type of work they carry out; the judiciary supports all its employees with the primary task of carrying out its key role;?neither of the trade union organizations (the complainants) is the most representative of judicial employees, at least as regards the scope of the national judiciary, of which the activity is glaringly inexistent;?since the claim is not about regulating the free exercise of the right to organize, the recommendations by the ILO Committee of Experts to the Argentine State that the most representative status should not imply privileges other than priority of representation in collective bargaining, in consultations with the authorities and in the appointment of delegates to international bodies?would not apply;?whereas, on the contrary, in the context of the complaint in question, and particularly vis--vis the national judiciary, full effect should be given to the ILO Constitution, which sets out the notion of the most representative industrial organizations (article , paragraph ), indicating that the claimants are not;?with regard to the CTA, it is noted that, because this confederation has been simply registered? as it claims, it cannot defend collective interests because it lacks the exclusive rights enjoyed by trade union associations with union status recognized under article  of ActNo.; it is thus presenting its case jointly with the FJA, which has trade union status, but no influence in this judiciary; and?Mr Pablo Micheli, who",0,2011,Argentina
85,"presented himself as Secretary-General of the CTA, did not have such unquestionable trade union representation as to be able to take a complaint before an international body against the National State for violation of international treaties; the conflict within this union association, which gave rise to the decision of  July  of the National Labour Appeals Tribunal, in the case entitled Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) v. the National Electoral Board (CTA) on proceedings filed for the protection of constitutional rights (amparo)?is public.
.In its communication of May , the Government indicates that the relevant consultations are undertaken in the judicial services that are not governed by a collective agreement.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege that judicial workers not exercising acts of public authority (i.e. those providing services within the judicial services, such as administrative and management tasks and services, or, in general, any service supporting the operation of the courts) do not enjoy the right to collective bargaining.
.The Committee notes that the Government has sent the reply from the CSJN on the case and that the CSJN indicates that the Framework Act Regulating National Public Employment No.  excludes judiciary staff from its specific scope, setting out that such staff is governed by a special rule and, therefore, for the Court, Convention No.  does not cover Argentinas judiciary staff. The Committee notes that in its reply, the CSJN states that: () the claim that the judiciary of Argentina is an integral part of its national public service is clearly unfounded, since the judiciary is vested with the authority to exercise judicial oversight over the actions of the public service, following the principle of the separation of powers of a federal and republican State; () the Framework Act Regulating National Public Employment No., which covers collective bargaining, expressly excludes from its scope national judiciary staff, setting out that such staff is governed by its special rule; () judiciary workers enjoy the same policy of privileges and exemptions as judges and public officials, except as regards the latters professional incompatibilities, and, like them, their income is guaranteed by a system of self-sufficiency under the judiciary; () the complainant organizations are not the most representative of judicial employees, at least as regards the scope of the national judiciary; and () the relevant consultations are undertaken in the judicial services that are not governed by a collective agreement.
.The Committee recalls that in the preparatory work leading up to Convention No. , it was established that judges of the judiciary did not fall within the scope of implementation of the Convention; nevertheless, said Convention does not exclude the auxiliary staff of judges. Also, according to Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, only armed forces and the police may be excluded from its scope. Furthermore, the same article states that the Convention applies to all branches of economic activity and that as regards public service, special modalities of application of this Convention may be fixed by national laws or regulations or national practice. Therefore, although the Committee notes that judiciary workers in Argentina are not covered by the Framework Act Regulating National Public Employment and that the characteristics of the judicial sector may make it necessary to apply special modalities as regards collective bargaining (especially with regard to salaries, since state budgets must be approved by Parliament), it deems that auxiliary staff of the judiciary must have the right to collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government, as under Article  of Convention No. , to take measures adapted to national conditions, including legislative measures if necessary, to promote collective bargaining between the judiciary and the trade union organizations concerned.
.With regard to the statement by the CSJN that the complainant organizations are not the most representative and that the CTA, because it is merely registered, cannot defend collective interests as it lacks the exclusive rights for that purpose, which are recognized for trade union associations with union status as under Act No. , the Committee recalls that it has considered that systems of collective bargaining with exclusive rights for the most representative trade unions and those where it is possible for a number of collective agreements to be concluded by a number of trade unions within a company are both compatible with the principles of freedom of association [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para.]. The Committee also recalls that, in the context of Case No. , it strongly urged the Government to take a decision without delay regarding the CTAs application for trade union status (made almost three years ago)?[see Report No. , June , para. ].
.Lastly, with regard to the statement by the CSJN that the signatory of the complaint did not have such unquestionable trade union representation as to be able to take a complaint on the violation of international treaties before an international body, the Committee notes that a complaint relating to the electoral process of the CTA is indeed currently pending. The Committee notes that in any case, the present complaint has been presented jointly by the CTA and the FJA.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government, pursuant to Article  of Convention No. , to take measures adapted to national conditions, including legislative measures if necessary, to promote collective bargaining between judiciary authorities and the trade union organizations concerned.",-1,2011,Argentina
86,".The complaint appears in a communication from the United Trade Union of Education Workers of Mendoza (SUTE) and the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  May , SUTE officially registered as trade union No. by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, and the CTERA alleges that two pieces of legislation have been adopted that are prejudicial to the interests of education workers in the Province of Mendoza who are members of CTERA and of other workers in the Province. The legislative acts are in serious breach of the principles laid down both in international law and in Argentinas own legislation with respect to freedom of association. The legislation that the complainants challenge is as follows: Decree No.  issued by the mayor of the city of Mendoza and published in the Official Gazette of the Province of Mendoza on  June , and Ordinance No.  issued by the Deliberating Council of the municipality of Mendoza, which was never applied to the SUTE or its representatives until  August .
.The complainant organizations consider that these municipal orders are in breach of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina on  January , inasmuch as the Convention guarantees workers?organizations the right to organize their activities and to formulate their programmes. They state that the public authorities?interference in these matters is liable to prevent or hinder the legal exercise of those rights. They add that the regulations issued by the municipality were challenged in the Supreme Court of Justice of the Province of Mendoza, through the only channel provided for in the Provinces Civil Code of Procedure, in a bid to have them declared unconstitutional. The appeal was lodged with the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court as case No. , United Trade Union of Education Workers against the Municipality of Mendoza, on grounds of unconstitutionality?
.The appeal was rejected by the Court without refuting the grounds advanced by the complainant and in violation of the latters right to offer and produce evidence, which is a manifest infringement of article . of the American Convention on Human Rights. The ruling was not challenged judicially, despite the fact that the Supreme Court of Justice of Argentina regularly does so, pursuant to article  of the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure which empowers it to overturn both extraordinary federal appeals and direct appeals or complaints at its own discretion (this is the only judicial channel for obtaining a review of a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice of a province). Moreover, the case law of both the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza both of the Province of Mendoza and the federal Supreme Court of Justice has repeatedly confirmed that the latter is not competent to hear cases involving provincial public law. This has led to a de facto situation in which the formal admission of extraordinary appeals and/or complaints has been left purely and simply to the discretion of the said Supreme Courts.
.According to the SUTE and CTERA the provisions that they are challenging violate the terms of ILO Convention No.  in so far as they prohibit and punish (by the imposition of fines and the threat of imprisonment) the holding of collective demonstrations within the capital of the Province of Mendoza. Decree No. / reads as follows:Article  ?Use of the esplanade of the municipality shall be authorized for the holding of demonstrations and similar events within the city of Mendoza and, on such occasions, the venue shall be fitted out with adequate platforms and loudspeakers free of charge. The parties concerned must accordingly submit a request the Executive Department at least  hours prior to the event, indicating the name and address of the organization and of its legal or statutory representative, with the number of the relevant identity document, as well as the time the event is scheduled to start and to finish.Article  ?Demonstrations and similar events starting from any location other than that indicated in the preceding article shall proceed along the sidewalks, duly respecting pedestrian crossings and traffic signals.Article  ?The presiding Court of Misdemeanours shall be immediately notified of any failure to abide by the municipal regulations in force. The enforcement of the penalties provided for under ordinance No. // shall be the responsibility of the Directorate of Traffic of the municipality of Mendoza.Article  ?Cultural, sporting, educational, governmental and religious events involving the use of public roads within the meaning of Ordinance No. // shall be subject to prior authorization by the Executive Department, for which purpose a request must be submitted at least  hours prior to the event in accordance with Act No. .Article  ?This provision shall be publicized as broadly as possible through the Press.Article  ?This provision shall be published, communicated and included in the Book of Decrees.
.The complainants go on to state that article  of Ordinance No.  of , which was applied to the SUTE for the first time in August , stipulates: The holding of any type of event on public thoroughfares within the area comprising the streets known as Patricias Mendocinas, Rioja, Crdoba, Godoy Cruz, Coln and Vicente Zapata is prohibited, other than the holding of events which by their size and conduct do not hinder the normal movement of pedestrians and vehicles; such events may be authorized by the Executive Department? Decree No. / stipulates: Article  ?The presiding Court of Misdemeanours shall be immediately notified of any failure to abide by the municipal regulations in force? This refers to article  of the Code of Misdemeanours of the municipality of Mendoza, which stipulates: Any person who disregards a legal provision adopted by the competent authority in the interests of justice, public safety or health shall, unless the act constitutes a more serious offence, be sentenced to  days under arrest or to a fine of up to , pesos?
.According to the complainants, the municipality of Mendoza has clearly provided not only that trade unions that organize demonstrations be fined but also that the Court of Misdemeanours should be duly notified; the latter may order union officials or any workers participating in a march to be placed under arrest for up to  days. In other words, both the Ordinance and the Decree being challenged lay down rules of conduct which, if disobeyed, give rise immediately to a fine and/or up to  days under arrest. As can be seen from the provisions referred to, the fines are applicable both to the trade union that convenes a demonstration and to the workers who take part in it. This means that the municipality may impose a fine that is equal to two or three times the average wage of a member of the teaching staff, and even more in the case of non-teaching staff; at the same time, there is a real possibility that both union officials and workers taking part in a demonstration may be placed under arrest.
.The complainants explain that Argentinas Constitution establishes that the State is a national unit comprising Provinces which retain powers that are not vested in the federal Government and that in turn the latter recognize an internal political division (articles  to  of the Constitution). These internal political units are known in the Provinces as municipalities and, as in the case of the city of Mendoza, as departments. Each department possesses an executive governing body (the Office of the Mayor) and a deliberating body (the Deliberating Council). The powers of the municipalities are set out in general terms by the national Constitution (autonomy); in the case of the Province of Mendoza, these powers are governed by Mendozas provincial Constitution, as established by the latter, are complemented by Provincial Act No.  (the Municipalities Organic Act). The city of Mendoza is the capital of the Province (article  of the provincial Constitution) and the seat of all the provincial authorities (executive, legislative and judiciary).
.The headquarters of the General Directorate of Schools, which is the principal employer of education workers, is in the city of Mendoza, where numerous private employers (private management schools) are also located. The municipal regulations challenged by the complainants impede the peoples exercise of their right to demonstrate collectively, and therefore also that of the SUTE and of its members. The SUTE has already been sanctioned for exercising the right to demonstrate collectively, having been heavily fined for that reason since August .
.The complainants maintain that the restrictions they are challenging have no legal basis. On the contrary, the Provincial Transit Act currently in force provides explicitly for the possibility of using public thoroughfares for demonstrations",5,2011,Argentina
87,"(article , Act No. ). Even the law that was in force when Ordinance No.  was adopted contained no provision prohibiting the use of public thoroughfares for demonstrations or requiring authorization for such purposes. Article  merely stipulates that the Directorate of Traffic of the Province of Mendoza may make temporary arrangements for the movement of people and vehicles when circumstances so demanded for reasons of public order and safety (article (c), Act No. ). Moreover, the restrictions denounced by the complainants have no basis in fact since, under the pretext of regulating peoples right, they curtail the right to demonstrate only when the demonstration is in support of a demand or complaint; any other demonstration is allowed to take place even if it makes it impossible for people to move about and irrespective of the extent or degree to which traffic is disrupted. The ban applies to the entire territory of the municipality of Mendoza and thus prevents the exercise of freedom of association even in the limited sense of freedom of action and freedom to demonstrate in support of demands made of the workers?employers and/or the public authorities.
.According to the complainants, the ban on the use of public areas in exercise of the right to demonstrate is an infringement of the fundamental principles laid down in Articles , . and . of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Articles , , ., .(a) and (c), . and . of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and Articles ., , ., ., ,  and  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The municipal Decree challenged by the complainants maintains that mass demonstrations in support of a demand or complaint entail the restriction of other individual and collective rights and cause traffic congestion and disruption in the city which pose difficulties for people and for private vehicles buses that use the thoroughfares every day and whose legitimate rights are thus affected? Consequently, such demonstrations are prohibited anywhere other than on the esplanade of the municipality, whereas other events?are specifically authorized under article  of the Decree. In other words, it is only when the events?are in support of a demand or complaint that they constitute undesirable and reprehensible conduct, while sporting, religious, government-sponsored and other events supposedly do not disrupt traffic. Moreover, according to the Decree challenged by the complainants, collective and mass demonstrations that are not in support of a demand or complaint do not restrict other peoples individual rights or cause traffic congestion, or at least do not do so to the point where they need to be prevented, as in the case of demonstrations by workers demanding better wages or better working conditions or voicing their opinions, demands or complaints.
.According to the complainants, the Decree they are challenging requires demonstrators ?when marching in support of a demand or complaint ?to keep to the sidewalks and observe traffic signals or to meet on the esplanade in front of the municipality; this shows clearly that the Decree prevents freedom of expression and demonstrations only when workers meet to inform their fellow citizens publicly of their working conditions and their demands. Such activities as these are punishable by fines and possibly by up to  days?imprisonment without any justification, since Decree No. / is obviously not concerned with the flow of traffic or the use of public spaces but is aimed simply at preventing demonstrations in support of a demand or complaint, which is an essential and universal means of expression of workers all over the world. The Decree also strikes a blow against the right to establish trade unions and to participate in union activities, since it imposes restrictive conditions on demonstrations that it does not impose on associations that are not concerned with lodging complaints or demands with the authorities or with employers.
.The complainants state that it is abundantly clear that the Decree violates the principle of equality. Denying the complainants and their representatives the use of public areas is the method that the municipality has chosen to restrict their freedom of association while in practice there is no such ban on other people or groups in exactly the same circumstances. The wording of international treaties varies, but Article  of the UDHR and Article  of the ICESCR refer to the equality of all human beings in dignity and rights and to their equal right to enjoy all their rights, thereby consecrating or recognizing the right to equality in the same way as do Articles . and  of the ICCPR. This principle of international human rights law has been grossly violated by the Decree challenged by the complainants, inasmuch as it deems reprehensible only those trade union demonstrations or other mass demonstrations in support of demands and complaints.
.The complainants add that the regulation they are challenging violates the principle of legality embodied in the aforementioned international treaties, all of which stipulate that the exercise of recognized rights are subject only to restrictions provided for in law. Decree No. / does not comply with the restrictions imposed by law and is not itself a law.
.It is the complainants?understanding that any rule or regulation that restricts or regulates human or constitutional rights or other fundamental guarantees must be adopted by a democratically elected legislative body, in order to safeguard the democratic goals and principles on which the international treaties on human rights are based.
.The complainants wish to make it clear that the provincial Constitution, by investing the administration of local interests and services solely in the Office of the Mayor, has created a body whose competence is limited and which has the power to administer or govern itself only within the bounds of organic laws adopted by a higher body, i.e. the provisions of the Constitution and other legislation in force. That being so, the Executive Department of the city of Mendoza, acting through the Mayor and the Municipal Council, is guilty of a violation of freedom of association, inasmuch as it claims to exercise legislative powers which are explicitly denied it and whose exercise in practice violates the principles of equality, legality and reasonableness by undermining the free exercise of trade union rights. The ban imposed by the Mayor disregards workers?rights in respect of a particularly sensitive issue for trade unions, namely, the possibility of publicizing their demands or official position in pursuit of their goals by making them known to workers and other citizens by the only means at their disposal, i.e. by word of mouth in public areas to which other people have access. Worse still, the ban is an attempt to hide the demonstrating workers from public view, thereby violating the most elementary principles of the international system of human rights.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government provided the reply from the authorities of the city of Mendoza. The latter note from their analysis of the complaint that the complainants maintain that Ordinance No. / and Decree No. / violate Article  of ILO Convention No. , ratified by Argentina in , and that the provisions they contain were contested before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Province of Mendoza, which rejected the appeal. The complainants based their appeal on grounds of the unconstitutionality of the municipal regulations, which they argue are in breach of Convention No. .
.The authorities state that, as the complainants themselves recognize, they took the matter to the provincial Supreme Court of Justice on the grounds of their unconstitutionality. The appeal lodged by the SUTE was rejected by the Second Chamber of the provincial Court in case No. , under the heading United Trade Union of Education Workers against the Municipality of Mendoza? Since no appeal was lodged against the ruling, as the complainant recognizes, it was deemed confirmed and accepted. The Court stated categorically that: The right to protest may, like any other right, be subject to reasonable regulations if it is intended thereby to maintain public order and safety in the movement of people and vehicles or ensure peaceful social coexistence. The requirement of mere advance notice in order to ensure public order and avoid detracting from other peoples rights that are likewise guaranteed by the Constitution is deemed to be reasonable. Allowing demonstrations to take place under the organizers?own arrangements does not imply the restriction of any right but rather its legitimate exercise? In other words, the provincial Court itself, in examining the case, declared that the regulations in question were not in breach of any precept whatsoever inasmuch as it was designed to enable demonstrations to take place in an orderly manner, which does not entail the restriction of any right but rather its legitimate exercise.
.The city authorities note that the complainants claim that the municipal regulations prohibit the holding of collective demonstrations within the provincial capital of Mendoza, and that it is punishable by fines or a possible prison sentence. According to the authorities, this interpretation of the regulation is erroneous",-1,2011,Argentina
88,"since, to begin with, it does not prohibit collective demonstrations but seeks to ensure peoples freedom of movement, by arranging for peaceful demonstrations and placing platforms and loudspeakers at their disposal, subject to prior authorization, or by confining the demonstrators to the sidewalks and requiring them to respect the pedestrians and obey traffic signals (articles  and  of Decree No. /); similarly, prior authorization is required only if the demonstration hinders the normal movement of pedestrians and/or vehicles (article  of Ordinance No./). In other words, not a single paragraph of the provision concerned imposes a ban on demonstrations as the complainants claim.
.This latter point, too, was recognized by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Province, which in its ruling stated: The Court pointed out that, from its reading of article  of Decree No. , the trade union has no legitimate concern, inasmuch as the regulation does not prohibit the holding of marches or demonstrations elsewhere than on the esplanade in front of the municipality but merely regulates them by requiring that they take place on the sidewalks and that they respect pedestrian crossing and traffic signals. Such arrangements cannot be classified as denying a right? since the restrictions imposed are perfectly reasonable legal regulations, inasmuch as regulations aimed specifically at the movement of pedestrians on sidewalks and the abuse of that right are in full compliance with the fundamental principles of constitutional law. That being so, there is no way the article can be accused of being unconstitutional and undermining supposedly supralegal fundamental rights, since it is obvious that the regulations adopted under the legislation in force constitute no more than a reasonable and legitimate restriction that cannot possibly be considered a curtailment of any right. It may be concluded from the above that the complainant has not demonstrated in any credible way that it has suffered any such prejudice as it claims as a result of the enforcement of either Decree No.  or Ordinance No. , given that the former reflects the logic and prudence that should prevail when regulating a right and the regulation adopted by the Deliberating Council was agreed to by the trade union. Consequently, the latters claim to have suffered a prejudice has to be rejected?
.The city authorities state that the provisions in question clearly endeavour to balance the prejudice sustained by the complainants against that caused to the rest of the community. It is common knowledge that the main thoroughfares in the city centre are brought to a standstill every day by the steady increase in the number of vehicles using them, as well as the large number of public transport buses, and that even in normal circumstances this causes regular traffic jams in the citys main arteries. If, in addition, the traffic is held up by demonstrations, the situation becomes even more fraught. It is the workers using the thoroughfares who suffer and the right to freedom of movement that is whittled away, and this in turn prevents people from getting to work and back and from receiving prompt treatment in health centres. If the city thoroughfares are used in such a way that the rights of the general public are disregarded or restricted, then prior authorization has to be required so that their use can be properly regulated and its consequences foreseen, with the traffic police controlling the traffic at certain points or through some other solution. At the same time, the point must be made that the complainants have their own institutional means of resolving their disputes, such as joint committees or the legitimate use of the right to strike. This is recognized in the preambular paragraphs of Decree No. /, which states that it is reasonable and desirable that the exercise of the right to present demands and to hold meetings be reconciled with the right to freedom of movement, both of which have equal constitutional validity?
.Furthermore, far from requiring that trade unions organizing demonstrations be fined or that their members be arrested, as the complainants maintain, the municipality uses Decree No. / to offer demonstrators several options that do not deny them their rights. For example, with prior authorization they can use the esplanade in front of the municipality free of charge and equipped with platforms and loudspeakers. If they use another location, they can march on the sidewalks, provided they respect the pedestrians and traffic signals. If they want to organize other kinds of events involving the use of public thoroughfares, they must seek prior authorization, failing which they are liable to the fine provided for in the Ordinance or else the presiding Court of Misdemeanours is notified.
.There is nothing whimsical about this provision, which can be found in the former Provincial Traffic Act (Act No. , superseded by Act No. ) which by means of regulatory Decree No. / used to prohibit pedestrians from using the streets (article). This is precisely what happens when a demonstration takes to the public thoroughfares. Article  of the current Provincial Traffic Act (Act No. ) stipulates: The use of pubic thoroughfares is prohibited for purposes other than the movement of vehicles, such as processions, demonstrations, meetings, exhibitions and running, cycling, equestrian or motor car races. Authorization may be granted by the public authorities only if: (a) the free flow of traffic can be maintained normally by using alternative routes; (b)the relevant bodies certify that they will assure the necessary safety measures for people and assets at the location; and (c) the organizing body itself, or a duly contracted insurance company, accepts full responsibility for any damages sustained by third parties or by the road network as a result of an event involving certain risks? Obviously, the general principle, which is set out in greater detail in the Act than previously, is that the use of public thoroughfares for purposes other than road traffic is prohibited, and that any exception to this rule is dependent on compliance with the conditions laid down therein and subject to prior authorization from the relevant authority ?which, as shall be seen, is ipso facto the municipality.
.Notification of the presiding Court of Misdemeanours is based on article  of the provincial Code of Misdemeanours, entitled Abusive use of the right of assembly? which stipulates: Any person or persons organizing meetings in public areas in breach of the lawful regulations governing safety and general convenience shall incur a fine of up to , pesos? This shows that the complainant organizations?claim that trade unions organizing demonstrations are fined or their members are arrested?is therefore false.
.Article  of Decree No. / stipulates that, in cases of non-compliance with the municipal regulations in force, the presiding Court of Misdemeanours must be immediately informed. It is then for the said Court to determine whether the Code of Misdemeanours has been breached and, if so, to impose a penalty ?a decision that is not the responsibility of the municipality.
.Regarding article  of the Decree challenged by the SUTE, which claims that it undermines the rights of the trade union and its members, the relevant text reads: Demonstrations and/or other events held in a location other than that indicated in the previous article must use the sidewalks and respect pedestrian crossings and traffic signals? On this point the Provinces Supreme Court of Justice stated in its aforementioned ruling: As indicated above, it is not this article but Ordinance No.  and article  of the Provincial Traffic Law that prohibit the use of public thoroughfares for demonstrations, unless they have been authorized by the competent authority and on condition the normal flow of traffic can be maintained using alternative routes and provided safety measures are in place and there are no risks involved?
.As the Public Prosecutor stated in the Courts ruling, the possibility that the Decree affords for anyone to use public thoroughfares for demonstrations without seeking authorization does not imply, or provide grounds for claiming, that this unrestricted concession is unlawful when it invokes inconveniences that have to be avoided in order to comply with the requirements of the regulation. A requirement based on peoples convenience cannot be deemed manifestly unreasonable, nor does it infringe any constitutional right.
.The complainants also claim that the wording of the regulation implies that the fines and possibility of arrest referred to extend both to the trade union and to workers taking part in a demonstration; but it is not true that the said provisions they challenge are open to any such interpretation, as they do not impose sanctions on workers taking part in a demonstration. No workers have ever been sanctioned, and the SUTE has been charged only with causing an obstruction in violation of article  of Act No.  and article  of Ordinance No. /.
.As to the point headed Scope of the regulations being challenged?in which the complainants claim, inter alia, that (i) the restrictions introduced have no legal basis, (ii)the Traffic Act in force provides for the possibility of holding demonstrations, (iii) the provisions they are challenging",-1,2011,Argentina
89,"restrict the right to demonstrate only when they are in support of demands or complaints and not otherwise, and (iv) the ban is a blanket prohibition that applies throughout the territory of Mendoza, the city authorities maintain that the complaint is completely unfounded for a number of reasons. To start with, Ordinance No. /, which was adopted by the Deliberating Council of Mendoza on December  and entered into force upon its publication in the Official Gazette on February , provides for the imposition of a fine on any person who violates article thereof, which bans any kind of demonstration or similar event on public thoroughfares within the area comprising the streets known as Patricias Mendocinas, Rioja, Crdoba, Godoy Cruz, Coln and Vicente Zapata, save for events whose size and conduct do not disrupt the normal movement of pedestrians and/or vehicles and which may be authorized by the Executive Department. In other words, a regulation is now being challenged which has been in operation for more than  years and which does not entail any violation of the Constitution whatsoever.
.Moreover, as indicated above, the Ordinance derives from Provincial Act No.  which, by means of Decree No. / banned pedestrians from the streets (article ). Subsequently, the current Provincial Traffic Act (Act No. ) was adopted which banned the use of public thoroughfares for purposes other than the movement of people and/or vehicles but provided that in specified exceptional cases such use might be authorized under the powers conferred by article , which has already been examined. The same applies to article  of the provincial Code of Misdemeanours. In other words, the provincial regulation is the legal standard under which the provisions of Ordinance No./ and Decree No. / should be assessed.
.The Provinces Supreme Court of Justice has ruled that: It is an undeniable fact that the streets are public assets of the State, as stipulated in article () of the Civil Code to the effect that the streets, squares, paths, canals, bridges and any other public construction destined for the use of the community are reserved for the immediate and direct use and enjoyment of the inhabitants as a whole. It is generally agreed that they belong to the public domain of the municipality?(Rivera, Julio C. Instituciones del Derecho Civil, Parte General, Bs. As., Perrot, , vol. II, No. ; Salomoni Jorge L., Teora general de los servicios pblicos, Bs. As., ad hoc, , page ). Article  of Ordinance No. / is quite clear. It imposes a general ban on the holding of demonstrations or other public events on public thoroughfares, except for events whose size and conduct do not disrupt the normal movement of pedestrians and/or vehicles and which may be authorized by the Executive Department? This latter part of the said article makes it quite clear that there is no total ban?such as the complainants allege. The whole point of the regulation is as far as possible to reconcile the right to demonstrate and present demands with the right of all citizens to freedom of movement, to a healthy environment ?which becomes highly polluted in traffic jams ?and, in general, to carry out their daily activities normally. Demonstrations are thus authorized on condition they do not disrupt the normal flow of traffic.
.The same applies to Decree No. /, except that in this case the administrative authority goes even further and provides a venue for demonstrations, i.e. the esplanade in front of the municipality, which in addition it offers to equip with platforms and loudspeakers at no charge. Having proposed a fully equipped venue for demonstrations, the next article declares, not that any demonstration held elsewhere than in the specified location is prohibited, but that any such event must take place on the sidewalks and must respect the pedestrians and traffic signals. This entails making it possible to reconcile conflicting rights.
.Contrary to the claims of the complainants, the city authorities maintain that, far from extending the ban imposed by the regulatory Ordinance, Decree No. / sets out and amplifies the possibilities that exist for holding demonstrations, as has been explained in the preceding paragraphs, even to the point of accepting that the free movement of pedestrians could be sacrificed. Furthermore, it is not true that the ban has been extended to the entire city and thus goes beyond the framework of Ordinance No. /. The complainants forget to mention that Act No.  ?adopted after the said Ordinance ?prohibits the use of public thoroughfares for purposes other than the movement of people and/or vehicles throughout the Province and not just in the city. It can therefore hardly be claimed in this respect that the Decree violates the Constitution in any way.
.The authorities insist that the principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association have definitely not been violated, since there is no trace of any ban on the right to demonstrate?in the regulation under examination, as the complainants claim. Nor do the provisions in question discriminate in any way against the type of event referred to. There are also no grounds whatsoever for maintaining that the provisions violate the fundamental principles of the international declarations and treaties cited by the complainants or that they constitute degrading treatment?or a slight on the dignity of any citizen. On the contrary, it is obvious from everything that has been said that the whole issue stems from the attempt to reconcile the rights of all the inhabitants of Mendoza without distinction of any kind.
.There is no violation of the right to freedom of expression and of opinion, either, since their exercise is not curtailed and demonstrations in support of demands and complaints are by no means banned, as the complainants would have people believe. The extensive arguments advanced by the latter on this point seem to overlook the fact that Act No.  imposed a blanket ban on the use of public thoroughfares for purposes other than pedestrian and vehicular traffic and that Ordinance No. / refers to any type of demonstration or similar event on public thoroughfares.
.The Decree under examination introduces a distinction that is quite reasonable, since experience has shown that the kind of demonstrations referred to in article  entail the use of the city streets; that is why it stipulates that they must keep to the sidewalks so as not to disrupt the traffic. Article  refers to other types of event, which do not necessarily occupy public thoroughfares. Even if they do, under article  of Ordinance No. / they can still be held so long as their size and conduct does not disrupt the normal movement of pedestrians and/or vehicles, which is why they can be held without the explicit prior authorization of the Executive Department.
.It should be noted that article  of Decree No. / does not stipulate any requirement as to prior authorization, precisely so as not to undermine demonstrators?rights. Prior authorization is required only for the use of the esplanade in front of the municipality. Consequently, far from introducing a form of negative discrimination, the Decree actually facilitates the organization of this type of demonstration, provided the procedure laid down in article  is adhered to. It is therefore untrue that it undermines the principle of equality. Besides, no other kind of event can take over the public thoroughfares either, given the prohibitions already referred to in Act No.  and Ordinance No. /. On the other hand, it is quite true that the pedestrians?freedom of movement will be restricted, but this is precisely because the restriction of certain individual rights is the sacrifice that must be made to protect the right to demonstrate.
.The city authorities state that the regulation challenged by the complainants infringes neither the principle of legality nor the American Convention on Human Rights, both of which allow certain legal restrictions on rights when they are imposed in the general interest, as the complainants themselves recognize. Yet the latter try to ignore both the authenticity of the laws analysed here and the municipalitys competence to issue its own regulations on the subject, claiming that its competence extends only to purely administrative?matters and disregarding the municipalitys degree of autonomy. They thus demonstrate a considerable ignorance of current institutional law. The point needs to be made that the blanket ban for the whole Province was made official by Act No.  and that the complainants have never questioned that Acts constitutionality. At the municipal level, it is Ordinance No. / that lays down the conditions for exercising the right of assembly and Decree No. / that establishes rules based on those provisions. The city authorities add that the laws adopted by the provincial legislature on the subject invariably make it a general principle that the use of public thoroughfares for demonstrations is subject to certain conditions; the Ordinance challenged by the complainants does no more than that, even though the complainants do everything they can to present it under a different light.
.In ruling on the matter, the Provinces Supreme Court",-1,2011,Argentina
90,"of Justice stated: Ordinance No. was duly adopted by the Deliberating Council in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by article () of the provincial Constitution, under which make it responsible for the health, welfare establishments not run by private companies and public thoroughfares, in conformity with the laws adopted by the legislature on the subject. ... That is why the Mayor, in the exercise of the powers conferred on him/her and acting within his/her sphere of competence, offers the use of part of the municipalitys public domain so that demonstrations do not cause chaos in the streets ?which are intended for the immediate and direct enjoyment of the inhabitants and are in the charge of the police. This is why, subject to their seeking prior authorization, anyone wishing to organize a demonstration or other similar event can use the esplanade in front of the municipality.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.There is no juridical or logical justification for feigning to be unaware of the constitutional authority of the legislature, the Deliberating Council and the municipalitys Executive Department to resort to the police in the way provided for. Moreover, the Mendoza city authorities believe that the regulation challenged by the complainants does not go against the opinions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, as the complainants claim. The latter consider that the purpose of the regulation is not substantial, since pedestrians and vehicle drivers suffer only minor inconvenience? It will be noted that, while the complainants arbitrarily play down the right of pedestrians and vehicles to freedom of movement, Decree No. / explicitly states in its preambular paragraphs that its purpose is to reconcile the exercise of the right to present demands and the right of assembly with the right of people and vehicles to move about freely, both of which it recognizes as having equal constitutional validity. In other words, whereas the complainants refer pejoratively to the right of citizens to move about freely, the municipality places both sets of rights on an equal constitutional footing in an attempt to reconcile the interests of both parties.
.Finally, the authorities state that they can only request that the representation presented by the complainants be rejected, inasmuch as the provisions they are challenging are in no way designed to achieve the objectives that they suggest. On the contrary, the provisions are a reasonable attempt to reconcile the rights of a democratic society that have been established by competent and legitimate bodies, as was recognized by the Provinces Supreme Court of Justice in its ruling on case No. , United Trade Union of Education Workers against the Municipality of Mendoza de Mendoza, on grounds of unconstitutionality??a ruling which is now definitive and has been recognized as such by the complainants.
.The Committee observes in the present case that the complainant organizations challenge Decree No. / issued by the Mayor of the city of Mendoza on  July  and Ordinance No. / issued by the Deliberating Council of Mendozas municipality, which in its opinion prohibit and punish the holding of collective demonstrations. (The said Decree (i) authorizes the use of the esplanade in front of the municipality ?equipped at no charge with adequate platforms and loudspeakers ?for the holding of demonstrations and similar events and stipulates that similar events starting from any other location must use the sidewalks and observe the pedestrian crossings and traffic signals, and (ii) provides that the presiding Court of Misdemeanours shall be informed of any failure to comply with the said regulations and that the Directorate of Traffic of the city of Mendoza may impose such sentences as are laid down in Ordinance No. / ?possible arrest of up to  days and fine of up to , pesos).
.To begin with, the Committee takes note that the complainant organizations and the government of the city of Mendoza state that the Supreme Court of Justice of the Province of Mendoza rejected a plea of unconstitutionality lodged by the SUTE against the Decree and Ordinance that it is challenging. According to the complainants, the Court rejected the appeal without refuting the evidence presented, thereby violating their right to present evidence, and no appeal was lodged against the ruling because the case law of the federal Supreme Court of Justice has repeatedly confirmed that it is not competent to rule on matters of provincial public law.
.The Committee also takes note that the government of the city of Mendoza states that the judicial authority of the Province maintained that the right to demonstrate ?like any other right ?may within reasonable bounds be regulated in the interests of public order and the safety of pedestrians and vehicles or of peaceful social coexistence? The Committee also takes note of the statement of the government of the city of Mendoza that: () the regulations challenged by the complainants do not prohibit collective demonstrations but are to ensure peoples freedom of movement, by arranging for peaceful demonstrations and placing platforms and loudspeakers at their disposal, subject to prior authorization, or by confining the demonstrators to the sidewalks and requiring them to respect the pedestrians and traffic signals, prior authorization being required in such cases only if the demonstration hinders the normal movement of pedestrians and/or vehicles; () none of the provisions prohibit demonstrations as the complainants claim, a fact that has been recognized by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Province of Mendoza; () the regulations seek to balance the prejudice sustained by the complainants against that caused to the rest of the community, it being common knowledge that the main thoroughfares in the city centre are brought to a standstill every day by the steady increase in the number of vehicles using them; () if, in addition, the streets are blocked by demonstrations, then the traffic can become so dense that workers using the roads suffer, freedom of movement is curtailed and people are prevented from getting to work or to health centres; () as a result, if the usage of the city thoroughfares disregards or restricts the rights of the general public, prior authorization is required so that their usage can be properly regulated and its consequences foreseen, with the traffic police helping to control the traffic; () far from stipulating that trade unions organizing demonstrations should be fined or their members arrested, the Decree offers demonstrators several options that do not deny them their rights (i.e. they can use the esplanade in front of the municipality or, if they use another location, they can march on the sidewalks provided they respect the pedestrians and traffic signals); () for any other event requiring the use of public thoroughfares a request must be made for prior authorization, failing which the fine provided for in the Ordinance applies and the presiding Court of Misdemeanours is notified and the corresponding sanction imposed ?a decision which is not the responsibility of the municipality; () the regulation challenged by the complainants does not stipulate any penalty for workers taking part in a demonstration and no such penalty has ever existed, the entire responsibility being placed on the SUTE for causing an obstruction in violation of article  of Act No.  and article  of Ordinance No./ (the complainant sent the Committee a copy of a municipal resolution fining the SUTE for obstructing the traffic in several streets of Mendoza); () Ordinance No./ introduces a federal ban on demonstrations or similar events on public thoroughfares, except for those whose size or conduct does not hinder the normal movement of pedestrians and/or vehicles and which may be authorized by the Executive Department; and () the regulation does not imply any discrimination against the type of demonstrations in question and there are no grounds for claiming that the provisions being challenged violate freedom of opinion or of expression.
.In the light of all the foregoing information and of the ruling in question, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2011,Argentina
91,".The Committee last examined this case, submitted in June , at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras  to ]. The Committee recalls that this case relates to obstacles and a delay of several years in the processing of an application for trade union status by the Federation of Energy Workers of the Argentine Republic (FETERA) filed with the labour administrative authority. In the last examination of the case, the Committee strongly urged the Government to take the necessary measures without delay so that: (a) the trade union status for which FETERA has been applying for over  years is awarded; and (b) in consultation with the social partners, all the provisions of the Act on Trade Union Associations (No. ), which do not conform to the principles of freedom of association are amended as recommended by the ILO supervisory bodies. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In their communications of  March  and  May , the complainant organizations, the Confederation of Workers of Argentina and FETERA, indicate that: (i)without prejudice to the Committee's recommendations and the statements made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations concerning the granting of trade union status to FETERA, more than  years have passed without the Ministry of Labour taking a decision in that regard; (ii) since the Ministry of Labour failed to act, in November , an appeal was lodged with the National Labour Appeals Chamber (Case No. /); (iii) on  June , the Chamber granted the appeal and ordered the Ministry of Labour to award trade union status to FETERA; (iv) on  April , the Chamber rejected the extraordinary appeals lodged by the Ministry of Labour and the Federation of Electricity and Energy Workers (which had acted as a third party); and (v) on  April , the Chamber submitted the decision to the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations.
.In a communication of  September , FETERA indicates that, more than  years since the proceedings were instituted and in accordance with the resolution of the Labour Appeals Chamber, on  September , Ministry of Labour resolution No./ was published in the Official Gazette, providing for the granting of trade union status to FETERA. FETERA emphasizes the enormous and important work done by the ILO supervisory bodies in an attempt to guarantee the right to freedom of association and the effective operation of the system so that, finally, FETERA achieves recognition through greater representation within the framework of Argentinian laws.
.In its communication of  May , the Government indicates that the proceedings that were in progress before the National Labour Appeals Chamber (Case No. /) had not been finalized. The Government attached a summary of the proceedings that had taken place within that case.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that on September , the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security granted trade union status to FETERA.
.The Committee recalls that FETERA requested trade union status in . It also recalls that it first examined this case in  and, on that occasion, recalled that delays in a registration procedure represent a serious obstacle to organizations being established and are equivalent to refusing workers the right to set up organizations without prior authorization.
.The Committee notes that, according to the statements made by the complainant organizations, on  June , the National Labour Appeals Chamber ordered the Ministry of Labour to grant trade union status to FETERA. It also notes that, according to both FETERA and the Government, on  September , the Ministry of Labour granted trade union status to FETERA. The Committee notes this information with satisfaction and expresses the firm hope that this precedent will contribute significantly to improving the functioning of the procedures for granting trade union status.
.The Committee brings the legislative aspects of this case, i.e. those relating to the Act on Trade Union Associations, No. ., to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, and considers that the case is closed and will not continue with its examination.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras ?]. The Committee recalls that the complainant organization, the Federation of Energy Workers of the Argentine Republic (FETERA), alleged obstacles and an -year delay in processing the application for trade union status filed with the labour administrative authority at its November  session. In examining the case, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee regrets the length of time that has elapsed ( years) since the complainants request for trade union status and recalls that a long delay in the procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights.(b) The Committee urges the Government to verify the percentages of membership to determine which of the two trade unions in question (FETERA in the areas of coverage requested or the organization with trade union status referred to by the Government) is most representative. If the complainant organization is found to be more representative than the organization with trade union status, the Committee requests the Government to grant it the trade union status it has been requesting since .
.In a communication from February , FETERA sent additional information in relation to the complaint, recalling that it: () is a second-level organization registered as a union since  February ; () groups together all the first-level organizations representing workers employed in the production, exploitation, sale, transmission, transport and distribution of energy, broadly defined, or derivatives required for the production of energy, at every stage, and who work for private employers, the State at national, provincial or municipal level, cooperatives or employee stock ownership companies, whether as operators, administrative employees, technicians or managers, with coverage across Argentina; and () started the application procedure for the federation in , and then in  adjusted the application for trade union status to cover the areas of its member organizations, the Light and Power Workers?Union of Mar del Plata and the Association of Professional Workers of the National Atomic Energy Commission and the Nuclear Sector.
.FETERA adds that, although the Committee urged the Government to expedite the application, the Committee had asked the Government to perform the comparative count (verifying the percentages and membership) in the manner provided for in section  of ActNo.  on Trade Union Associations. Were this to happen, it would seriously violate the freedom of association of the organization and its members. The complainant organization recalls that both the Committee and the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations called into question the counting procedure set out in this law.
.In reference to the complaint, FETERA alleges that the Government misled the Committee by maintaining that in view of the personal coverage claimed by FETERA and of the existence of another organization at the same level competing for similar status, the provisions of section  of Act No.  apply? FETERA affirms that the system set forth in section  of Act No.  is applicable in cases in which the competition for trade union status is between two first-level unions. Section  is in other words not applicable when the application for trade union status is by a federation, confederation or workers?central organization, irrespective of whether or not there are already bodies at the same level and scope which enjoy trade union status (the complainant organization indicates that the Ministry of Labour has often stated that the trade union status of a second- or third-level trade union body must be in line with the geographical area and category of persons recognized in the status of the trade unions which make up that trade union association. Trade union status has, for example, been granted in this way to the Argentine Federation of Pastry, Cake, Ice Cream, Pizza and Biscuit Makers, the Federation of Government Professionals of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the National Taxi Drivers?Federation (FEPETAX)).
.FETERA goes on to state that, when counting dues-paying members, under the procedure covered by section : if another association of workers with trade union status exists, the same status can be granted to another association to carry out its activity in the same area, occupation or category, only if the number of dues-paying members of the applicant association, for a continuous period of at least six months prior to the application, was considerably larger than that of the existing association with trade union status? FETERA claims that in reality it is almost impossible for a trade union seeking trade union status to replace an existing trade union. This is on account of a number of factors, including the requirement to count dues-paying members? This requirement relates to section  of Act No. , which obliges employers to deduct union fees solely for bodies with trade union status. FETERA maintains that, since a trade union which does not have trade union status must",0,2011,Argentina
92,"collect its fees in person, each month receiving the relevant amount from each of the members, the body seeking trade union status is at a clear disadvantage when it comes to replacing other unions, given that it is specifically its dues-paying?members who are counted. Lastly, FETERA points out that under sections  and  of the Act on Trade Union Associations, a trade union which does not enjoy union status lacks the basic legal rights to represent its members adequately. This shortcoming not only applies to collective bargaining, but also implies, for example, that its directors and members are not protected or cannot call a strike.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed since additional information was sent by the complainant organization, the Government has not sent its observations on the matter. The Committee recalls that it has already had the occasion to note with concern that, for a number of years, it has had to examine cases relating to Argentina concerning allegations of excessive delays ?between three and four years ?in the processing of applications for trade union status [see, for example, th Report, Case No. , paras ?; th Report, Case No. , paras ?; th Report, Case No. , paras ?; th Report, Case No. , paras ?; and thReport, Case No. , para. ]? On that occasion too, the Committee recalled that as early as  it urged the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in the future, when an organization requests registration or the granting of recognition, the competent administrative authorities return their decisions without unjustified delay?[see th Report, op. cit., paras  and ]. Lastly, the Committee requested the Government to take, in consultation with representatives of workers?and employers?organizations, the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act, under which, in order to challenge another associations trade union status, the petitioning association must have a considerably larger?membership, and section  of implementing Decree No./, which qualifies the term considerably larger?by laying down that the association claiming trade union status should have at least  per cent more dues-paying members than the organization which currently holds the status?[see th Report, Case No. , para. ].
.In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures without delay so that: (a) the trade union status for which FETERA has been applying for over  years is awarded; and (b) in consultation with the social partners, all the provisions of the Act on Trade Union Associations (No. ) which do not conform to the principles of freedom of association are amended as recommended by the ILO supervisory bodies. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Federation of Energy Workers of the Argentine Republic (FETERA) of June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of June , FETERA alleges that the Ministry of Labour has refused to grant the organization trade union status, displaying a clearly discriminatory attitude which is contrary to ILO Convention No. . The complainant states that FETERA is a second-level trade union organization registered on  February  by Decision No. of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.The complainant points out that FETERA groups together all the first-level organizations representing workers employed in the production, exploitation, sale, transmission, transport and distribution of energy, broadly defined, or derivatives required for the production of energy, at every stage, and who work for private employers, the State at national, provincial or municipal level, cooperatives or employee stock ownership companies, whether as operators, administrative employees, technicians or managers, with nationwide coverage.
.FETERA states that it started the application procedure for trade union status (personera gremial? in , under file No. /. It adds that, on  September , the legal representative of the Federation adjusted the application for trade union status with regard to its affiliates, the Light and Power Workers?Union of Mar del Plata and the Association of Gas Workers.
.In a new request dated  September , the application for trade union status was again adjusted with regard to the Light and Power Workers?Union of Mar del Plata and the Association of Professional Workers of the National Atomic Energy Commission and the Nuclear Sector (APCNEAN), cancelling the request concerning the Association of Gas Workers. The complainant organization states that the following documentation was attached with the file: () a certified photocopy of the record of the APCNEAN executive committee meeting, dated  June , in which it was decided to approve the unions affiliation with the Federation, submitting it to ratification by the general congress; ()acertified photocopy of the record of the national extraordinary congress of delegates of the APCNEAN, dated  August , at which it was decided to affiliate with the Federation; () a certified photocopy of the national extraordinary congress of delegates of the APCNEAN dated  August ; () a copy of the record of the Eighth National Extraordinary Congress of the Federation of Energy Workers of the Argentine Republic, dated  March , at which the APCNEANs affiliation was unanimously approved; and () a minute signed by the general secretary and the trade union secretary of the APCNEAN stating that they supported the application for trade union status filed by FETERA.
.FETERA states that this, however, was not enough for the labour administrative authority, which, in a decision issued in , requested the following in addition to everything that had already been provided:(a)	that the APCNEAN state whether it was affiliated with another second-level organization; and(b)	given the time that has elapsed since the request was filed ( May ), that the Light and Power Workers?Union of Mar del Plata state whether it is affiliated to another second-level organization and whether it gives its assent to the present application for trade union status?
.The complainant organization alleges that, in view of the above, and despite the clearly arbitrary nature of the decision of the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, it being patently obvious that the request was solely intended to delay its duty of bringing the procedure to its conclusion, FETERA, together with the abovementioned trade union organizations, complied with the new request in a timely and proper manner.
.Nonetheless, the complainant states that the Ministry of Labour still did not issue a final decision on the application; accordingly, a letter, the content of which is reproduced below, was sent to the Ministry:I, JOS JORGE RIGANE, in my capacity as General Secretary of the FEDERATION OF ENERGY WORKERS OF THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC (FeTERA), located at Av.Belgrano , rd floor, Buenos Aires, in the application under consideration, request that the necessary steps be taken to ensure that the trade union organization which I represent is granted the trade union status for which it applied in a timely manner.Our application procedure, which has been renewed, now dates back nearly  years, having been begun on  July , after this body registered our organization as a second-level trade union association on  February , by MTSS Decision No. .I am pleased to inform you that the organization I represent has complied with each and every one of the requirements laid down in the law and administrative regulations. As may be seen from the documentation, its personal and geographical coverage has been duly demonstrated, and there is no conflict between the coverage claimed by FeTERA and the organizations informed by the National Directorate under section  of Act No. , none of which have come forward.Our right is the very principle of freedom of association enshrined in Conventions Nos and  of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and in the statements of the Committee on Freedom of Association of the Governing Body of that organization, the aim being for the workers in the energy sector of the Argentine Republic to be able to defend their rights through an organization such as FeTERA, which has demonstrated from its inception an unwavering commitment to the destiny of the workers employed in the sectors it represents.Over the nearly  years of its regrettable administrative peregrinations in search of trade union status, our organization has fallen victim to legislation which has been repeatedly criticized by the global labour administration (ILO), as recently expressed by the Committee of Experts of the ILO when it made an observation criticizing the Argentinian trade union model? in which it urged the Government to amend Act No.  and to grant trade union status to the Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA), our sister confederation, which has suffered the same fate as FeTERA for many years.There can certainly be no justification for the administrative delay caused by your Ministry in the granting of the status requested. This is all the more so",0,2011,Argentina
93,"considering that our countrys highest tribunal, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, issued a detailed opinion on new orientations to bring our legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association under the abovementioned ILO Conventions, which are recognized in article , para. , and article bis of our Constitution.There is nothing to justify the implementing authoritys silence which denies our right in an essentially politically motivated stance on your part ?of that we have no doubt at this point.As a member of the executive branch, Sir, you have every right to exercise your ministerial mandate as you deem appropriate based on merit and expedience, but if legitimate requests such as this one are denied a decision systematically and without reason for so many years, while other similar cases are given due consideration, with no more ado than a mere formality, then, Sir, this is nothing but POLITICAL DISCRIMINATION through princely power? which is strange in a democratic State governed by the rule of law with social justice, which we seek to build together, with equality of opportunity and respect for collective freedoms.
.The complainant organization states that the Ministry of Labours only response was again silence, expressing disregard for the right of FETERA, its affiliates and all the members and workers represented by the latter.
.Lastly, the complainant points out that given the time that has elapsed since it applied to the Ministry of Labour for trade union status ( years), it is presenting a formal complaint against the Government of Argentina in view of the fact that its action constitutes a clear violation of freedom of association.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that, in view of the personal coverage claimed by FETERA and of the existence of another organization at the same level competing for similar status, the provisions of section  of Act No.  apply.
.The Government adds that the complainant organization itself also recognized the complexity of the problem, since, as may be seen from the report of the General Directorate of Legal Affairs (a copy of which is attached by the Government), during all the time that has elapsed it has not availed itself of the legal remedies afforded by the legislation itself in order to protect its rights.
.Lastly, the Government points out that another reason explaining the failure to use the judicial remedy available is that the first-level trade union affiliated to the complainant organization has trade union status, and the situation of the Federation thus does not affect its capacity to negotiate conditions of work, so that freedom of association is not impaired.
.The Committee observes that in this case FETERA alleges that it started the application procedure for trade union status (personera gremial? in  with the administrative authority; that in  and  it adjusted its application with regard to two FETERA affiliates (the Light and Power Workers?Union of Mar del Plata and the APCNEAN); and that, although it complied with all the requirements, the Ministry of Labours only response was silence.
.The Committee notes that the Government states: () that in view of the personal coverage claimed by FETERA and of the existence of another organization at the same level competing for similar status, the provisions of section  of Act No.  apply; ()the complainant organization itself also recognized the complexity of the problem, since, as may be seen from the report of the General Directorate of Legal Affairs (a copy of which is attached to the Governments reply), during all the time that has elapsed it has not availed itself of the legal remedies afforded by the legislation itself in order to protect its right; and () another reason explaining the failure to use the judicial remedy available is that the first-level trade union affiliated to the complainant organization has trade union status, and the situation of the Federation thus does not affect its capacity to negotiate conditions of work, so that freedom of association is not impaired.
.The Committee recalls that under the Act on trade union associations, No.  the association that is most representative in terms of geographical and personal coverage shall obtain trade union status, provided that it meets the following requirements: (a)it has been registered in accordance with this Act and carried out its activity for at least six months; (b) its membership includes over  per cent of the workers it seeks to represent; and (c) the designation of most representative association shall be granted to the association with the highest average number of dues-paying members out of the average number of workers it seeks to represent? Section  of the Act, referred to by the Government in its reply, provides that: If another trade union association of workers with trade union status exists, the same status can be granted to another association to carry out its activity in the same area, occupation or category, only if the number of dues-paying members of the applicant association, for a continuous period of at least six months prior to the application, was considerably larger than that of the existing association with trade union status. Once the application has been filed, the association with trade union status shall be informed within days in order to enable it to present its defence and provide evidence. The applicant shall be informed of the reply within five days. The evidence shall be subject to verification by both associations. Where the decision is taken to grant trade union status to the applicant, the trade union that had such status shall remain registered. The requested trade union status shall be granted without the need to carry out the procedure provided for in this section, provided that the express consent of the highest decision-making body of the association previously holding trade union status is given.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In this regard, the Committee observes that the Government states that in this case the provisions of section  of Act No.  apply, given that there is an organization at the same level competing for status in a similar area as the complainant organization, but does not specify whether, judging from the information provided by FETERA (between  and ) a comparison of the membership of the two associations was carried out and what the result was. In these circumstances, the Committee regrets the length of time that has elapsed ( years) and recalls that a long delay in the procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee urges the Government to verify the percentages of membership to determine which of the two trade unions in question (FETERA in the areas of coverage requested or the organization with trade union status referred to by the Government) is most representative. If the complainant organization is found to be more representative than the organization with trade union status, the Committee requests the Government to grant it the trade union status it has been requesting since .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee regrets the length of time that has elapsed ( years) since the complainants request for trade union status and recalls that a long delay in the procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights.(b)	The Committee urges the Government to verify the percentages of membership to determine which of the two trade unions in question (FETERA in the areas of coverage requested or the organization with trade union status referred to by the Government) is most representative.

94,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA) dated April . The CTA sent additional information in a communication dated  January .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  August, November  and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of April , the CTA, a third-level organization of trade unions and workers, states that it recently held leadership elections which gave rise to interference from the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MTESS) (Ministry of Labour). Specifically, the CTA states that its complaint constitutes a challenge to the decision of  December  of the Trade Unions Directorate at the Ministry of Labour (file No. /) invalidating, for reasons cited in the decision, the convocation and holding of supplementary elections within the CTA on  December . The aforementioned decision states that the basis for holding the meeting of the national executive committee at that office on  November  with the attendance required by the (union) regulations and for convening supplementary elections to be held on December  in the form prescribed by the aforementioned constitution was not correctly established, and so the validity thereof cannot be recognized owing to non compliance with the regulations.
.The CTA states, in accordance with the facts which, in its view, represent a violation of Convention No. , that for the purpose of convening elections to renew the leadership of the CTA at national, local and regional level, an agreement was concluded on September  between lists  and  ?which both had official authorization to take part in the elections ?and the national electoral board to accept arbitration and the establishment of an autonomous tribunal for the settlement of electoral disputes in order to resolve any disputes that might arise between the lists of candidates in the leadership elections due to be held on  September . In this way, union autonomy would be protected and there would be no involvement on the part of the labour administrative authority or any other body of the administration (Ministry of Labour) in internal union or electoral disputes. After the elections went ahead on the aforementioned date, the results for some entire districts and for certain polling stations in other districts were the subject of challenges by lists  and , initially made to the national electoral board as the authority supervising the elections and subsequently, in accordance with the signed agreement, to the autonomous tribunal established by that agreement.
.The CTA indicates that, as a result of the various decisions issued by the autonomous tribunal for the settlement of disputes further to the challenges from both lists, supplementary elections were due to be held in the districts of Misiones, Tucumn and Mendoza and at  polling stations in another seven districts. According to the CTA, the voting which took place in the aforementioned polling stations and districts and was declared null and void by the autonomous tribunal represented only  per cent of the polling stations that took part in the elections on  September , the results from the remaining  per cent of polling stations and districts remaining unchanged in accordance with the decision of  October  of the national electoral board; this was not contested by lists  and  and, following the obvious deduction of the annulled results, yielded a difference of , votes in favour of list . With respect to the appeals that each list lodged with the autonomous tribunal in due course, the latter ruled that the results obtained in the abovementioned districts should be null and void and that, inasmuch as the void results could alter the final result and to meet the requirements of the national electoral board, the CTA national executive committee should convene supplementary elections in due time and form.
.The CTA draws the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association to the fact that, under the regulations of the CTA, the only body with authority to convene elections and, consequently, supplementary elections is the national executive committee (section ). On this basis and in conformity with the ruling of the autonomous tribunal, the national electoral board (JEN), by an official notification dated  October , convened a meeting of the national executive committee to be held at  p.m. on  November , stating in the notification that the meeting was pursuant to the ruling of the CTA autonomous tribunal for the settlement of electoral disputes, its purpose being that the committee would consider convening supplementary elections for the national leadership in some provinces and polling stations, in accordance with the majority pronouncements of the tribunal. On the same day ( November ), the notary Ms Gabriela Rua Peavera established a formal record of the attendance of  members of the national executive committee and of their approval of the proposal made by Mr Pablo Micheli to convene supplementary elections for  November . The meeting, which was convened by the national electoral board pursuant to the ruling of the tribunal, was not attended by the members of the national executive committee who had stood for election on  September  as list  candidates, including the general secretary whose term of office had expired, Mr Hugo Yasky.
.The CTA states that regardless of the fact that those attending the meeting approved the convening of supplementary elections for  November , the choice was made to continue seeking agreements with the members of list  in order to complete the elections on the same basis of consensus as in the first part. On account of the complexity involved, there would be a need to harmonize modes and forms of composition relating to the various disputes that could arise in the different districts. Following intensive negotiations, it was agreed between the members of lists  and  that supplementary elections would be held on  December . As a result of this agreement and in view of the approaching end of the academic year (a settlement of the dispute was urgently needed since teachers comprise the membership of the first-level trade union to which the list  candidate belongs), Mr Hugo Yasky, the former general secretary, sent a registered letter convening a new meeting of the national executive committee to be held on  November at CTA national headquarters. The date already having been agreed, the registered letter reaffirmed the proposal to hold supplementary elections on  December .
.The registered letter sent to each of the members of the national executive committee, summoning them to attend the meeting of  November , already specified the date of  December  for the supplementary elections. In this context, on  November , the persons summoned by Mr Hugo Yasky met at the established time ( p.m.) at the union headquarters and waited for  minutes before starting the meeting. Hence, on November , it was decided to convene supplementary elections in accordance with existing agreements and to set the date of  December  for the elections, as proposed by Mr Hugo Yasky. The decision reached at the national executive committee meeting was referred to the national electoral board so that it could issue the convocation for supplementary elections for  December . On  and  November , the convocation for these supplementary elections was published in the Diario Crnica, a national newspaper. The national electoral board then issued decisions dated  November and  December  giving notice of the elections to be held as supplement to those of September .
.The CTA alleges that the former general secretary (Mr Hugo Yasky) surprisingly called a new meeting of the executive committee for  December , the date set for the supplementary elections. At that meeting the secretariat and members ratified the supplementary elections by a ? vote. Thus, at the  December  meeting attended by  members, the supplementary election process was upheld and, as a preventive measure should there be any suggestion of the slightest procedural flaw in the convocation issued by the national executive committee at its meeting of  November , any potential technical defect was completely rectified, recognition thus being given with formal rigour and scrupulousness to the democratic electoral will of the CTA membership, especially those who exercised their right to vote in the elections of  September  and the supplementary elections of  December .
.Prior to the abovementioned meeting of the national executive committee endorsing all decisions taken at the meeting of  November , Mr Pablo Micheli, the outgoing deputy secretary and general secretary elect of the CTA, was notified on  December  of the opposition made by Mr Hugo Yasky to the challenge to the certification of leadership claimed to have been unlawfully extended as of  November  by the Ministry of Labour, which had",-1,2011,Argentina
95,"prolonged the expired terms of office of the members of the national executive committee pending the assumption of office by the leaders elected in the convened elections? In the aforementioned submission Mr Hugo Yasky, apart from opposing the challenge to the certification of leadership issued by the Ministry of Labour, applied for an administrative declaration of judicial ineffectiveness of the electoral convocation issued by list ? The CTA adds that further to the completion of the supplementary elections on  December , the national electoral board conducted a definitive scrutiny on  December  of the supplementary elections of the CTA, which had been convened on  November , held on  December  and won by list  (led by Mr Micheli). The national electoral board then announced the appointment of the elected candidates, installing the members of the national executive committee in office. It should be noted that the aforementioned action of the national electoral board was recorded in notarial deed No.  of  December .
.The CTA alleges that the decision of the Ministry of Labour of  December  constitutes an act of interference on the part of the Ministry. Specifically, this decision states that the basis for holding the meeting of the national executive committee at that office on  November  with the attendance required by the (union) regulations and for convening supplementary elections to be held on  December  in the form prescribed by the aforementioned constitution was not correctly established, and so the validity thereof cannot be recognized owing to non-compliance with the regulations. The Ministry of Labour does not have competence for the matter which is the subject of the administrative act issued in the light of articles bis (guarantee of free and democratic trade union organizations) and () of the National Constitution inasmuch as, since the reform of , a series of international human rights instruments recognized as having constitutional status have been incorporated into the latter (including ILO Conventions Nos and , the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). Article  of Convention No.  establishes the right of workers?and employers?organisations to draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. Accordingly, the public authorities must refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof?
.The CTA points out that these rules of interpretation are no different from those confirmed by the Supreme Court of Justice of Argentina in the recent ATE and Rossi cases, definitively consolidating the method of application of freedom of association in domestic law with the scope recognized in the international sphere by the ILO supervisory bodies. According to the CTA, all the above clearly shows the obstacles that would deny any competence to the Ministry of Labour to establish itself as the supervisory body for trade union elections in general, and it is therefore the labour courts that have competence to deal with this matter.
.In conclusion, the CTA affirms that the Ministry of Labour has no competence to deal with its electoral process. The Ministry has violated freedom of association as delineated by the Supreme Court of Justice in the light of the principles stated above and the views expressed on numerous occasions by the ILO supervisory bodies, the guarantees laid down by articles bis (guarantee of free and democratic trade union organizations) and () of the National Constitution, ILO Conventions Nos  and , the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In addition, this administrative authority has declared its lack of competence in this specific case through the observations made in relation to the approval of the amendments to the CTA regulations concerning extension of the categories of workers eligible for membership and direct affiliation as a legitimate mode of acquiring member status.
.The CTA indicates that all of the above clearly shows that the full observance and real validity of the guarantee of freedom of association, of the principle of non-interference and of the right of trade unions to elect their representatives in full freedom is only compatible with a system of legal supervision implemented by independent bodies. In the case of the Argentine legal system, the only independent body is the national judiciary.
.The CTA reiterates that the issue here is of supplementary elections ordered by an autonomous tribunal appointed by lists  and  and endorsed by the CTA national electoral board. Accordingly, such elections could only take place as part of the electoral process of which  per cent had been completed and which required for its completion supplementary elections in three districts (Misiones, Tucumn and Mendoza) and in polling stations (of another seven districts) where the results had been declared null and void by the tribunal whose decisions were binding for lists  and  and also for the national electoral board, which was one of the signatories of the agreement through which it came into existence. It should be noted that the Ministry of Labour has competence for acts of registration, and it is in this connection that it was notified of the elections of September and the supplementary elections of  December. In an act of deliberate confusion, aware of the incompatibility with freedom of association and of the views of the ILO supervisory bodies, the act of interference in question is that the  December  decision of the Trade Unions Directorate at the Ministry of Labour was included in the notification sent to the authority for registration of the electoral process.
.The CTA also refers in this specific case, in addition to the above, to the exclusion of competence decided on by lists  and  with respect to the autonomy of the CTA, which resulted in them signing, on  September , the agreement to accept arbitration and to establish the autonomous tribunal for the settlement of electoral disputes in the CTA. This states, inter alia, that one of the founding principles of the CTA is the strict respect for autonomy, which is reflected in its regulations and its history and has been incorporated as a value in all its structures. In terms of purpose, both lists state explicitly that the protection of the autonomy of associations in electoral matters has been explicitly recognized by the ILO and a key consequence of this is non-interference by the labour administrative authority or any government body (Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security) in inter-union and electoral disputes.
.The CTA indicates that despite the pledges to respect autonomy and avoid intervention from the Ministry of Labour and the judiciary made by the two most representative strands of the CTA at the time of the leadership elections (lists  and ), the former general secretary instituted legal proceedings to have the supplementary elections held on December  declared null and void, the competent body being National Labour Court No. . This involved an application for an innovatory protective measure suspending the assumption of office prescribed by the CTA national electoral board. This measure was rejected and there was no appeal from the plaintiffs. It is our understanding that pending a judicial ruling revoking the autonomous decision of the national electoral board, that decision remains fully in force and must be implemented and complied with. However, the Ministry of Labour continues to recognize the members whose term of office has expired as the CTA leadership, on the basis of an extended term of office and a provisional certification of leadership. It should be noted that the object of this request for intervention is concerned exclusively with the decision of the Trade Unions Directorate at the Ministry of Labour (file No. /) invalidating, for reasons cited in the decision, the convocation and holding of supplementary elections within the CTA on  December .
.The CTA states that the subject of the complaint is not an internal dispute within the union: on the contrary, it addresses the act of interference from the Ministry of Labour which undermines the autonomy of the CTA. Finally, the complainant organization sends a copy of the ruling issued by the Labour Court of First Instance, rejecting the action seeking to quash the decision to convene the supplementary elections held on  December .
.In its communication of  January , the CTA reiterates that the case refers exclusively to the intervention of the Ministry of Labour of  December , in which the political authority questions the legitimacy of convening supplementary elections. In no way is the complaint concerned with the extension unlawfully granted by the Ministry of Labour to the leadership whose term of office had expired. The CTA states that on the basis of the jurisprudence of the Committee, the national electoral board decided to provisionally install in office the leadership elected on  September  and in supplementary elections on  December . The",-1,2011,Argentina
96,"second-instance ruling of Division No. of the National Labour Appeals Chamber overturning the first-instance ruling of Court No.  was appealed against in a complaint to the Supreme Court of Justice in view of the rejection of the extraordinary appeal. Under Argentine procedural legislation, an appeal does not have a suspensory effect until the court rules on its viability. To date, no such ruling has been issued. The CTA alleges that throughout this time no action was taken with a view to a further convocation of supplementary elections.
.According to the CTA, the list defeated in the elections has no intention of convening elections, which would thus enable the CTA to return to normal. The CTA considers that the new facts are as follows: () the filing of the appeal with the Supreme Court seeking revocation of the ruling of the National Labour Appeals Chamber; and () the installation of the leadership in office pending a definitive decision by the national electoral board.
.In its communications dated  August and  November , the Government states that, firstly, the submission of a complaint needs to be made in accordance with the procedural rules of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the principles of public international law relating to labour matters. The ILO supervisory system does not recognize individual submissions, only collective ones. Any issue examined in this international forum must have the backing of a trade union organization or group of workers which the Committee considers sufficient to be regarded as an organization. In this case none of the requirements have been met, since the complainant does not have the status of elected representative of the CTA on account of the judicial circumstances surrounding the actions described, a situation which has not been resolved by the justice system. Therefore this lack of official backing is not in conformity with international law. Moreover, this issue corresponds to the sphere of public international law and consequently follow-up action must be taken by the supervisory bodies, with no admittance of the discretionary powers of the Committee on Freedom of Association in the treatment thereof, since this is an exceptional situation involving self-limitation of the sovereignty of States ?article  of the Vienna Convention; according to the Treaty of Versailles, States are only obliged to respond if required to do so by an organization of workers, international bodies not being obliged to deal with individual cases. Because of the above, prior to any proceedings, the complainant must rectify the abovementioned omission in order to be in conformity with the provisions of international law relating to disputes. The Argentine State refuses to deal with the case until such action is taken, without prejudice to the reply set forth below.
.The Government sends the second-instance ruling relating to Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA) v. Electoral Board ?amparo proceedings?(Case No. ./), in which Division No.  of the National Labour Appeals Chamber overturned the first instance ruling of National Labour Court No. . Accordingly, the appeals court ordered the revocation of the decision in point I of the appealed ruling and upheld the application of the CTA requesting the supplementary elections held on  December  to be declared null and void.
.In the Governments view, the foregoing confirms what it has stated repeatedly concerning alleged unofficial intervention by the Government in the CTA elections: namely, that the democratic institutions of the country are wholly functional, and this implies judicial scrutiny of acts of government.
.The Government affirms that the intervention of MTESS (Ministry of Labour) was legitimate and respected collective autonomy in conformity with Convention No.  on freedom of association because the Ministry of Labour intervened at the request of one of the parties involved in accordance with section  of Act No.  ?a legal provision that was never questioned by the ILO central bodies. The intervention was legitimate because the competence of the autonomous arbitration tribunal?established by the parties, having reached the limits of its competence, declared its task to be completed and ordered its self-dissolution on  November . There is a legal obligation for the administration and for those administrated, namely to protect the property of associations that find themselves without leadership. The Government indicates that section  of the Civil Code states that any person whose term of office has expired is obliged to continue his activities in the form of maintenance tasks, otherwise he will be held liable for damages in the event of dereliction of duty; consequently, the action taken by the Ministry was also for the benefit of all the parties concerned. The Government has an obligation to fulfil its legal duty. The continuation of duties in the form of maintenance tasks following expiry of a term of office requires administrative authorization. Consequently, the State also has the obligation to adopt measures to maintain the assets of the organization. The decision that extended the term of office of Mr Yasky was restricted to essential institutional acts to comply with the requirements of the legislation, which is the general criterion applied by the Ministry of Labour in similar situations.
.The Government points out that the decision to extend the term of office issued by the Ministry of Labour and validated by the judiciary was objective because it provides for the extension of all terms of office, the purpose being, precisely, not to interrupt the working of the organization. This conduct on the part of the administration is in accordance with Article () of Convention No. . Both parties validated the intervention, recognizing this competence because all the elections of the organization were subject to scrutiny by the Ministry of Labour.
.The Government indicates that this legitimacy ?apart from being based on the administrations own powers and the obligation of the outgoing executive committee ?and the correct conduct of the Ministry derives from adequate judicial scrutiny of acts of government since the Argentine system is among the most rigid and militant and the action of the administrative authority results from a procedure that was validated by the Supreme Court of Justice in Jurez Faustino et al. v. Ministry of Labour and Social Security ?Trade Unions Directorate-General ?amparo proceedings?(Cases Nos  and ). This is the context in which section  of Act No.  must be taken: All definitive decisions of the labour administrative authority concerning matters governed by this law, once the administrative channels have been exhausted, may be subject to judicial challenge by means of an appeal or summary proceedings, as appropriate, and in the form established by sections  and  ... .?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The actions of the Ministry of Labour were validated by the judiciary on two occasions: first, at the outset, when the protective measure requested by the sector of Mr Hugo Yasky for the legal reasons described above was issued and which was ignored by the opposing party, which acted outside the law because the election procedure was launched ?and this gave legitimacy to the action of the Ministry of Labour; second, through the appeal ruling, which confirmed the cancellation of the election results, as already notified to the Committee, and which forms part of these actions. The action of the Ministry of Labour is part of a functional intervention complementary to the administrative acts at the disposal of the executive authority.
.The Government adds that, initially, no reference will be made in the present reply to the statements of the complainants referring to the conduct of the parties to the electoral process since these are not matters for the Government to assess and are currently under examination in the justice system. The reply will therefore be limited to the intervention that was appropriate for the Government in the context of the principles of freedom of association and will only refer to the activity of the parties in so far as they relate to the activity of the State, which, as already indicated, occurred in the context of constitutional principles and guarantees and, moreover, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association, particularly Article  of ILO Convention No. . Without prejudice to this, it should be noted that the terms of the submission suggest an intent that goes beyond that of an international complaint, using the latter as an instrument to serve internal purposes, obstructing and distorting the action of the State, when the complainants themselves have engaged in conduct similar to that challenged in the submission.
.As regards the circumstances prior to the intervention of the Ministry of Labour, the Government states that the CTA held elections on  September , in which the Ministry did not intervene, respecting in all its terms the commitment to arbitration signed by competing lists  and  and the national electoral board of the CTA itself. This process concluded with the partial cancellation of the election, by decision of the independent body, on grounds of observed electoral fraud, as revealed by copies of the judgments of the autonomous arbitration tribunal. As a result of the declaration of partial nullity, the arbitration",-1,2011,Argentina
97,"tribunal declared that it would be necessary to hold supplementary elections in all provincial and local districts and at all polling stations where the results were cancelled. In the Governments opinion, the statement that even if the challenges had been accepted they would only represent  per cent of the electorate is irrational; the Government considers this to be a dogmatic statement which is not substantiated by any documentation.
.The intervention of the Ministry of Labour was at the request of one of the parties following a practice based on a judicial ruling which established that it was appropriate, and so there was a logical and natural sequence in the situation. Indeed, the autonomous arbitration tribunal considered its task completed and ordered its own dissolution on November , declaring itself no longer competent to deal with the matter, after issuing decisions on all appeals that were submitted to it. Moreover, it maintained that, when the leadership reached the end of its term of office on  September  and with appeals pending before the autonomous arbitration tribunal against the results announced by the CTA electoral board, the signatories to the arbitration agreement requested the independent body to take a decision with regard to extension of the term of office of the CTA leadership but the autonomous tribunal declared that it had no competence to that effect.
.As regards the intervention by the Ministry of Labour to preserve trade union autonomy in line with the requests made by the complainants on other occasions, the Government declares that, first, the complainant has not made any observation regarding the substantive content of the decision. In other words, there is no discussion regarding the Ministrys statement that in the administrative actions the basis for the presence required by the regulations for the meeting of the executive committee on  November was not correctly established, a matter which is being examined by the courts. The complainant, in the initial submission regarding labour matters, merely criticizes the timeliness, value and appropriateness of the intervention?and refers to a series of considerations and evaluations relating to the views of the ILO supervisory bodies which are not applicable in this case, for various reasons which will be examined in detail below but which can be summarized in terms of Argentine law being one of the strictest in the international system as regards the supervision of administrative acts.
.Consequently, the acts undertaken by the administration are fully compatible with the provisions of articles bis and () of the Constitution, contrary to the claim made by the complainant organization, and the various freedom of association cases that are unconnected with the reality of the country, in terms of both circumstances and legal aspects, are not applicable. Hence it should be noted that the criticism of the complainant relates to the administrative decision to extend the expired term of office of the leadership?including the plaintiffs ?for practical reasons concerned strictly with maintaining the administrative functioning of the organization because the channels established by the parties themselves for the implementation and safeguarding of the election process had been exhausted. The Government points out that both parties validated the intervention in recognition of this competence and on the basis put forward by the administration to extend the term of office of the leadership, which, specific and clearly limited as it was, was also validated by the judicial system in the two pending cases ?the dispute between the parties is before the courts ?since no ruling was issued ordering the extended leadership to be changed.
.The Government states that, as the Committee on Freedom of Association is aware, section of Act No.  establishes that the Ministry of Labour is the sole executive authority with regard to trade unions. On  October , the National Trade Unions Directorate received a submission from Mr Hugo Yasky in which, referring to his status of general secretary of the CTA whose term of office had expired on  September , he stated that since there had been no definitive result to the elections and that supplementary elections would be necessary in a number of districts in  provinces with the involvement of some , voting union members, he asked the certification of leadership to be renewed on a provisional basis until such time as the organization resumed normal functions. Mr Yasky requested such a decision as a matter of urgency with a view to taking essential action regarding administration of the CTA assets and to convening the necessary supplementary elections so that the organization could return to normal, taking particular account of the fact that, under section  of the CTA regulations, any decision to call elections is a matter for the national executive committee of the CTA.
.In the light of the issue raised concerning the elections held on  September  and taking into account that the terms of office of the members of the executive committee had expired on  September , the National Trade Unions Directorate extended the terms of office of the leadership on  November  subject to the limits stated, namely until the assumption of office of the leaders elected in the new elections which were due and in order to perform the necessary tasks to conserve and manage the assets of the CTA. The continuity of the term of office of the leadership registered in the abovementioned administrative department and within the limits stated constitutes a uniform and customary criterion that was applied previously by the labour administration in similar circumstances, including with respect to the CTA itself in . In the light of the above, the complainant organization lacks veracity and contravenes its own proceedings.
.The Government also adds that section (), second paragraph, of Act No.  states as follows: In the event of the absence of leadership within a workers?trade union or the body to which leadership duties have been assigned, and in so far as the regulations of the association concerned or of the federation of which it forms a part have not established any means of regularizing the situation, the executive authority may also appoint an official to perform the necessary tasks or to regularize the situation.?This is also without prejudice to the fact that section (), first paragraph, of the Trade Unions Act authorizes the Ministry of Labour to call elections for bodies which are responsible within workers?organizations for the governance, administration and supervision of the acts undertaken by the latter, and also for performing any other acts needed for the appointment of the members of these bodies through the elections. To this end they may also appoint the persons who will be responsible for performing those acts. All of the above applies in cases where, further to being instructed to do so, the body authorized to take the action concerned fails to execute the instruction within a set period of time.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The criterion applied by the labour executive authority to cases of absence of leadership consists of providing for the temporal continuity, within a restricted scope, of the most recent certified leadership so that the latter may complete the electoral process and other internal union action required to restore normal functioning. This is the most appropriate approach inasmuch as this preserves the autonomy of trade unions which go through such a situation of institutional abnormality, instead of having direct intervention from the administrative authority in the internal affairs of such organizations. Hence there are no doubts concerning the rationality of the action taken by the State as regards extension of the term of office.
.As regards the timeliness of the administrative intervention and its lack of arbitrariness and the scrutiny of administrative acts by the judiciary, the action of the Argentine State can never entail any risk of arbitrariness that undermines collective autonomy or violates the provisions of articles bis and () of the Constitution. This is because the voluntary action taken by the administration was a choice of both parties recognizing reasonable conduct in the action of the State. Furthermore, in terms of legal certainty on the basis of the Constitution, the complainants claim that the conduct of the administration violates Article  of Convention No.  and is therefore at fault is baseless. The complainant refers throughout its submission to a series of opinions of the Committee supposedly asserting that the intervention of the State might be arbitrary. However, as stated above, a closer look at the legislation of Argentina shows that the system is far from allowing any possibility of arbitrariness?since there is constant, ongoing supervision by the highest levels of the judiciary.
.The Government explains that prior to the elections of  September , the CTA submitted all elections to inspection by the National Trade Unions Directorate without any challenges being made to the scrutiny of the administrative authority or any questioning of the constitutional nature of section  of Decree No. /. Accordingly, the application of section  of the regulatory decree is justified by the need to ensure the effective force of the constitutional principle",-1,2011,Argentina
98,"of internal trade union democracy established in article bis of the National Constitution and in section  of Act No. , as upheld by the Supreme Court of Justice in Jurez, Rubn Faustino et al v. Ministry of Labour and Social Security (National Trade Unions Directorate) ?amparo proceedings?  April  (Cases Nos and ).
.The Government affirms that the intervention of the Ministry was not of its own accord but at the request of the parties and in line with an existing legal ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice. Both parties had asked the Ministry to extend the term of office in the last two elections; on the first occasion, this was done by the complainant. The extension of the term of office includes the retention by the complainants of the posts that they held before the elections, thereby avoiding any kind of legal objection preventing international representation of their sector at the Conference, and with no risk of delays as claimed. The issue is currently being examined by the courts and so the objection based on the complainants quotations from the opinions of the supervisory bodies, to the effect that the administrative decision might be arbitrary, is also invalid. The justice system has not changed the decision to extend the term of office or issued any protective measure that would reduce its impact; nor has the complainant questioned the content of the decision at the international level. Hence it cannot be alleged that the intervention of the Ministry was arbitrary, quite apart from the criticisms made in the complaint regarding the conduct of the opposing party, which, as stated above, is not party to the discussions with the Ministry.
.Finally, the Government reiterates that the status of general secretary of the CTA invoked by the complainant, Mr Pablo Micheli, lacks documentary support, according to the relevant procedures at the National Trade Unions Directorate. Nor has it been validated, up to the date of the present submission, in the court proceedings in progress: Micheli, Pablo v. Ministry of Labour ?amparo proceedings (Case No. ./) and Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA) v. CTA National Electoral Board ?amparo proceedings?(Case No. ./), both of which are before National Labour Court of First Instance No.  in Buenos Aires.
.The Government adds that, with regard to the statement by the complainants that MrMicheli constitutes the sole valid representative as an officer appointed by the CTA electoral board, it refers to the administrative act of  December, which was confirmed by the judicial body, extending the term of office of the existing leadership, as shown by the complainants own documentation ?a ruling by the prosecutor and by the second officiating magistrate. Both this and the previous judicial ruling both before and after the supplementary elections ruled in favour of maintaining the existing committee, bearing in mind that the extension of the term of office established in the administrative act has precise limits geared to convening new elections in the same conditions, form and manner as the previous elections, as requested by the complainant, in which an extension of the term of office had also been requested. Furthermore, the administrative action was at the request of one of the parties when the competence of the autonomous tribunal set up by mutual agreement of the parties to the dispute had been exhausted. In short, the ministerial action was validated with its limited scope of competence, in which the extension of the term of office was granted for the sole purpose of performing tasks to maintain the functioning of the trade union organization; this is the sole activity performed by the administration.
.The Government reiterates that the intervention of the Ministry of Labour was at the request of one of the parties, in a context of absolute freedom, in accordance with a remedy which both parties have used when established judicial review channels have been exhausted and with judicial scrutiny of the administrative act.
.The Government indicates that it is inappropriate to link the present case to quotations from opinions of the ILO, stating that the intervention of labour ministries accompanying a judicial submission should not have a suspensory effect on the validity of that election pending the final outcome of the judicial action. In this case, contrary to what was quoted, the judicial action was instituted not by the administration but by one of the interested parties requesting a protective measure. Moreover, the ILO has never questioned administrative intervention on the part of the executive authority in so far as there are adequate judicial controls. In the present case the administrative act was reviewed by two judges, who deemed the act to be reasonable, at least as regards the extension of the term of office, since the election had been conducted. In the first case, when Mr Hugo Yasky requested the preventive suspension of the elections of  December  and the protection of trade union rights ?section  of Act No.  ?the magistrate duly took account of the reasonableness of the administrative act, which was analysed in substantive and procedural terms. In more technical terms, it could be said that the administrative act was evaluated by the Public Prosecutors Office, which also endorsed the act.
.The second evaluation was made by the current officiating magistrate who overturned the innovatory protective measure and upheld the decision of the administration regarding the leadership, with the limits and purpose prescribed by the Ministry of Labour. There is no doubt whatsoever that the decision of the administration was subjected to judicial scrutiny on two occasions, its judicial value being assessed both times. This applies in particular to the second magistrate who, even at the level of the Public Prosecutors Office, conducted a thorough analysis of the position of both parties to the dispute and examined the value of the administrative act issued by the Ministry and the administrative act issued by the electoral board of the trade union determining the presumption of sufficient legitimacy of the ministerial decision to endorse the extension of the terms of office, within the limited scope of administrative decision-making.
.In other words, nobody can doubt that the judicial controls functioned properly. This is in line with the judicial interest in protecting freedom of association; consequently, there was no act by the administration which distorted, obstructed or modified any trade union right. This is a dispute that started at the administrative level and is now being examined at the judicial level with all constitutional guarantees and international labour instruments in force in Argentina. The Ministry has taken measures aimed at ensuring the maintenance that was necessary.
.The Government adds that before  December  the intervention of the Ministry originated on the basis of a convocation for supplementary elections published in a Buenos Aires newspaper on  and  November , calling elections to be held on December, at the request of list . This is the last action of the Ministry since despite the decision of the labour department suspending any elections the process continued, giving rise to a judicial application for protective measures from list , whereby the officiating magistrate suspended the act of  December , validating the extension of the term of office. The complainant organization claimed that it was not notified in time and so the elections went ahead, subsequently giving rise to other situations unconnected with this challenge in the local judicial sphere but whose repercussions as regards the legal action produced a situation of moral violence with respect to the officiating magistrate, who transferred competence to another magistrate (Labour Court No. ), who confirmed the extension of the term of office.
.According to the Government, the important thing is that when the Ministry adopted the measure there was no winner in the election and hence it was bound to invalidate any holding of elections on  December . For the administration, it was a question of an event which did not take place under its jurisdiction but under judicial jurisdiction and hence outside the supervisory scope of the international body, which is obliged to focus on the specific act undertaken by the Ministry of Labour, namely the extension of the term of office for specific purposes which was validated by the courts, since it is this which has judicial consequences. Hence, it is a matter for the State as far as the continuing validity of elections further to the challenge is concerned and pending a definitive decision, the elections are monitored from the start by the judicial authorities and fall outside the competence of the labour department, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Ministry intervened because the trade union organization was without leadership, the term of office having expired, and the leadership was extended exclusively for administrative tasks that were necessary prior to the elections; this is the only thing that must be considered in the international jurisdiction, since these are the sole effects of the decision of the administration which affected third parties and entered the sphere of freedom of",-1,2011,Argentina
99,"association. Otherwise, the judiciary has taken action since the outset and this action of the State is in line with the interests protected by freedom of association. There is unanimous international recognition that the administration may take steps to preserve the functioning of trade union organizations. What the Ministry did was to exercise the administrative authority that exists in legislation all over the world, subject to strict judicial supervision, whose act was endorsed on account of its reasonableness. Accordingly, the complainant has focused on the intervention of the Ministry and in these terms the international dispute has remained blocked; the action of the judiciary and the evaluation thereof within the supervisory system has been excluded from this international dispute. The Government wishes to avoid further confusion and distortions in addition to those that already exist in this matter.
.The Government points out that certain statements by the complainant seek to slow down, distort or influence both the work of this international body and that of the judiciary in Argentina. Situations of non-existent privileges are claimed, thereby misleading the ILO. The same misleading action is seen in the bogus claim of recognition of the validity of the elections by the labour administration, when the action by the Ministry predates the holding of the elections; at the time the elections were held, competence lay with the judiciary further to the issue of a protective measure. In any case, it is for the judiciary to make the assessment. It is a matter of criteria of judicial appraisal, which must be respected. The complainant organization also seeks to mislead by appearing to claim that views expressed by the supervisory system can influence the judicial process in the context of legitimate recognition of the competence of the State with adequate judicial scrutiny. According to the Government, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that judicial appraisal could not be subject to influence by the opinions of the ILO supervisory bodies.
.Finally, the Government concludes that the complainant causes confusion by citing cases of ILO jurisprudence, ascribing impossible conduct to the administration, since decisions were called for on a matter which was not under its jurisdiction. The work of the Ministry ceased before the elections and so it did not officially establish any winner. The conduct of the Ministry was in line with the international rulings on the matter. It restricted itself to extending a term of office prior to the elections as part of the task of recording anomalies in the election process, the discussion of which is a judicial matter. What is beyond discussion is the judicial confirmation of the extension of the term of office for the performance of administrative acts. In its communication of  May , the Government indicates that the issue of the CTA elections is currently before the judicial authorities and thus outside the Ministrys competency. It would therefore be totally inappropriate for the Ministry of Labour to intervene in any way.
.Before examining the substance of the allegations, the Committee notes the Governments statements to the effect that: () the ILO supervisory system does not recognize individual submissions, only collective ones, and that any issue examined in this international forum must have the backing of a trade union organization or group of workers which the Committee considers sufficient to be regarded as an organization; and () in this case none of the requirements have been met, since the complainant (the Government refers to the union officer who signed the complaint, Mr Micheli) does not have the status of elected representative of the CTA on account of the judicial circumstances surrounding the actions described. The Committee observes that the complaint alleges interference by the Government in the electoral process of the CTA and that the complainant considers that the list headed by Mr Micheli won the elections, with this union official having been appointed general secretary. The Committee therefore considers that the issues of substance raised in the case should be examined.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organization states that, for the purpose of renewing the national, local and regional leadership of the CTA, elections were held on  September  and that, as a result of challenges to the electoral process, the autonomous tribunal of the CTA declared the voting that took place at  per cent of the polling stations null and void (the results in the remaining  per cent were upheld, according to the complainant, and this was not contested by any of the electoral lists and the deduction of the annulled results yielded a difference of more than , votes in favour of the list headed by Mr Micheli), supplementary elections were convened for  December , and these were won by the electoral list headed by MrMicheli. The Committee notes that the complainant contests the decision of December  of the administrative authority (file No. /) invalidating the convocation and holding of supplementary elections within the CTA on  December  (i.e. the call for elections which, according to the complainant, affected  per cent of the polling stations).
.The Committee notes that the Government in its reply upholds the legality of the decision of the administrative authority of  November  to extend the term of office of the CTA leadership. However, the Committee observes that the complaint is not concerned with this issue but with the decision of the administrative authority invalidating the convocation and holding of supplementary elections within the CTA on  December . The Committee notes the Governments statements that: () the intervention of the MTESS was legitimate and respected collective autonomy, in conformity with the National Constitution and Convention No. ; () on completion of the electoral process of the CTA on September , the autonomous arbitration tribunal of the CTA ruled that it was necessary to hold supplementary elections in all provincial and local districts and polling stations where the results had been annulled (thereby concluding its tasks and being automatically dissolved); () the statement of the complainants that even if the challenges had been accepted they would only represent  per cent of the electorate is irrational; according to the Government, this is a dogmatic statement which is not substantiated by any documentation; () Division No.  of the National Labour Appeals Chamber overturned the first-instance ruling of National Labour Court No.  and ordered the supplementary elections held on  December  to be declared null and void (the complainant filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice seeking revocation of this judgment); () the foregoing confirms that the democratic institutions of the country are wholly functional, and this implies judicial scrutiny of acts of government; and () the issue of the CTA elections is currently before the judicial authorities and thus outside the competency of the Ministry of Labour.
.In the light of the above, as regards the decision of the administrative authority of December , challenged by the complainant, which invalidated the convocation and holding of supplementary elections within the CTA on  December , the Committee reminds the Government that any intervention by the public authorities in trade union elections runs the risk of appearing to be arbitrary and thus constituting interference in the functioning of workers?organizations, which is incompatible with Convention No. , Article , which recognizes their right to elect their representatives in full freedom [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.Finally, regretting the time that has elapsed without a definitive solution to the electoral dispute within the CTA, which without doubt seriously undermines the functioning of this organization, the Committee firmly expects the judicial authorities to take a decision on all the pending issues in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee regrets the time that has elapsed without a definitive solution to the electoral dispute within the Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA), which without doubt seriously undermines the functioning of this organization, and firmly expects the judicial authorities to take a decision on all the pending issues in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",-1,2011,Argentina
100,".This complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) and the San Luis Association of State Teachers (ASDE) dated  April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication in May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  April , the CTERA and ASDE report a situation of unusual gravity which is detrimental to the education workers of San Luis province, giving rise to the submission of the complaint against the Argentine Republic for violation of the fundamental principles of freedom of association, the free and democratic right to organize, and the right to trade union representation which, as laid down in the treaties and Conventions of the ILO, are guaranteed by Argentine legislation, including the national Constitution ((articles bis and , paragraph ) and other existing laws referred to below).
.The complainants state that the complaint relates to the actions of the state authorities in San Luis province, that is to say, the discriminatory and arbitrary acts of trade union harassment against Ms Mara Ins Quattropani, General Secretary of the ASDE and a member of the executive board of the CTERA. The complainants allege that MsQuattropani was threatened with dismissal for taking trade union leave without pay pursuant to section  of Act No. , which was communicated to the employer by the CTERA. Furthermore, the complainants add that San Luis province has also failed to deduct union dues at source for the ASDE despite doing this for other public sector organizations with the same legal status.
.The complainants allege that Ms Quattropani has suffered infringement of her rights as a state teacher and trade union representative, and her fellow union members have also been subject to clear discrimination. This has reached such illegal and arbitrary extremes that Ms Quattropani is threatened with arbitrary dismissal by the Ministry of Education of the province after their absurd refusal to grant her trade union leave in her capacity as a member of the executive board of the CTERA, as expressly and categorically provided for under section  of Act No.  concerning trade union associations. Ms Quattropani has been a state teacher in San Luis province since March , and is a member of staff at school No.  Provincia de Corrientes?in Villa Mercedes, San Luis province. She is also General Secretary of the ASDE and a member of the executive board of the CTERA as well as a full national congress member of the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA), having been elected General Secretary of the ASDE for two consecutive periods in  and .
.During her first term of office, Ms Quattropani requested trade union leave under section of the Regulations for Teaching Personnel, Provincial Act No. XV--, administrative file No. --, but has so far received no reply despite making repeated requests verbally and in writing. In mid-, Ms Quattropani repeated her formal request for trade union leave owing to the increasing difficulty of fulfilling both her work and union duties in the light of the upcoming elections at both the ASDE and the CTERA, as well as the subsequent elections at the CTA. Given the tacit refusal of previous requests, Ms Quattropani decided to make clear to the management of school No.  that the trade union leave would be without pay, as laid down in section  of the abovementioned Regulations, initiating file No. NOA---. In this document, dated  July , she provided the required documentation and stated that from  August  and until the end of her term of office ?November  if not re elected ?she would take trade union leave under section  of the Regulations, which clearly states: Requests for trade union leave without pay ?will enter into force from the requested date.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The complainants state that, under these conditions and without receiving any reply, MsQuattropani was re-elected in September  as General Secretary of the ASDE, a first-level trade union of the CTERA in San Luis province, and elected to the national executive board of the CTERA as a substitute member, which was communicated to the provincial authorities. On  December , on the orders of the educational authority, the management of the state school of San Luis province told Ms Quattropani to return to work and informed her that her absence was unjustified (it should be noted that the trade union leave considered unjustified began after the requisite one months notice on August  yet the authorities informed Ms Quattropani of this news?on  December , namely four months later).
.The complainants state that the reading and interpretation of section  of the abovementioned Regulations clearly show that the granting of trade union leave without pay is not at the discretion of the employer. The staff member only needs to respect the period of notice, as was the case with Ms Quattropani. This was ignored by the authorities who informed her in an arbitrary and illegal manner that she must return to work and dealt with her situation in such a manner that were Ms Quattropani to return to work, she could still face dismissal. Her right to trade union leave was denied and so far no reply has been forthcoming regarding the appeal lodged on  December  against the administrative authoritys decision of  December . According to the complainants, it is important to make clear that the situation is worsening and to such an extent that it represents clear discrimination against, and harassment of, the ASDE, the CTERA and of course MsQuattropani, given that trade union benefits that have been denied to these trade unions have been granted by the same authorities to other similar teachers?trade unions in the province (for example, trade union leave with pay was granted to Mr Danna, a delegate of the Argentine Teachers?Federation (UDA)).
.The complainants explain that the provincial authorities claim Ms Quattropanis situation is not concerned with trade union leave without pay but is about unjustified absence, and are obviously acting deliberately and maliciously in a typical anti-trade union manner given that the request for trade union leave under section  of the Regulations for Teaching Personnel of the province arises from the tacit and discriminatory refusal by the authorities of the timely request for paid trade union leave. The complainants request that the discrimination and intimidation should cease and that a ruling be delivered to ensure that San Luis province recognizes the trade union leave that had to be taken without pay from August . Furthermore, the complainants request that the ASDE and its members be accorded trade union leave with pay on the same terms as other teacher trade unions such as the UDA and the AMPPYA, both of which have their union dues deducted at source and have two members each on trade union leave, paid by the provincial government. According to the complainants, the ASDE should enjoy the same right so that these unfair inequalities cease, since the situation described above not only prevents it from functioning correctly but also puts its General Secretary at risk of dismissal.
.In its communication of May , the Government indicates that, in answer to its enquiries, the Ministry of Education of San Luis province replied as follows:
.The San Luis Ministry of Education provided a brief, balanced overview, stating that the teacher, Ms Quattropani, kept changing her request for trade union leave. In the first instance, she requested trade union leave with pay, then later requested trade union leave without pay. The Ministry stresses the fact that this was itself confusing, since the two requests involved a mixture of the provisions of both types of leave contained in the Regulations for Teaching Personnel (those in section  and those in section ). Indeed, in a note dated  July , Ms Quattropani stated that she would take trade union leave without pay as of  August . On  September, the Human Resources Department of the Ministry of Public Finance responded, indicating that the request could not be granted, since special leave as provided under section  of Act No.XV   was appropriate.
.It is worth pointing out that the Regulations for Teaching Personnel (Act No. XV--) do not provide for trade union leave without pay; in section , they provide for trade union leave and in section , for special leave without pay. The Ministry points out that, in this case, Ms Quattropani abandoned her teaching post on  August  without first ensuring that the administrative measures granting her any type of leave had beenimplemented. It indicates that these details can be found in administrative file No.NOA---, which will be complete once the certified copy of the file has been delivered.
.At the same time as requesting trade union leave, Ms Quattropani applied for a judicial measure, which included",-1,2011,Argentina
101,"a measure for no new action, dated  April , prohibiting any action that might alter or modify the state of the claim in law or in fact, as prescribed by law. This case is currently before court No.  of the Third Civil Commercial and Mining Court of the First Judicial District of San Luis province, and is docketed under: Quattropani Mara Ins c/Ministerio de Educacin y otros s/amparo?(file No./). The Ministry of Education adds that, since legal proceedings involving another branch of the State have been launched concerning this issue, it is necessary to await the judiciarys decision and ruling on the case, not only because that is appropriate in a State subject to the rule of law, but also because there is a judicial measure that specifically requires that this be the case.
.Lastly, the provincial education authorities point out that the teacher in question has another post in the San Luis province judiciary, namely in the second judicial district where she is a first administrative officer, with a -hour working week, file No. . This situation not only violates article  of the provincial Constitution and the rules on activities compatible with teaching (section  of the Regulations for Teaching Personnel), but also runs counter to the very purpose of the request for the supposed trade union leave, given that such leave should be granted in order to enable the person concerned to adequately perform their trade union duties. Hence, reaffirming the above, if the reason MsQuattropani applied for trade union leave was to carry out her duties as a trade union representative, those duties can hardly be performed if she continues to work in another field, regardless of whether both jobs are compatible or not.
.In conclusion, the Government states that, by virtue of the abovementioned and bearing in mind the information provided by the provincial education authorities, it is appropriate to await the relevant court decision and the referral of the administrative file concerned.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations state that Ms Mara Ins Quattropani, a state teacher in San Luis province and General Secretary of the ASDE, a member of the executive board of the CTERA and a full national congress member of CTA, requested trade union leave several times under section  of the Act concerning trade union associations ?according to the documentation attached to the complaint, on at least four occasions, in June and August , and October and December  ?and having received no reply informed the authorities that, under the provisions of the provincial Regulations for Teaching Personnel, she would take trade union leave without pay. The Committee observes that the complainants allege that: () in an illegal and arbitrary manner ?since according to the complainants the granting of trade union leave without pay is not at the discretion of the employer ?on  December , the management of the school in San Luis province told Ms Quattropani to return to work and informed her that her absence was deemed unjustified; () should MsQuattropani return to work and end her trade union leave without pay, she could still face dismissal; () this situation represents clear discrimination against, and harassment of, the ASDE and its General Secretary since the benefits denied to this trade union (for example the deduction at the source of the union dues of its members) are granted to other teacher trade unions; and () so far no reply has been forthcoming regarding the appeal lodged on  December  against the abovementioned decision of  December telling Ms Quattropani to return to work.
.The Committee notes the Governments statement that it consulted the Ministry of Education of the San Luis province, which replied as follows: () the teacher, MsQuattropani, kept changing her request for trade union leave (in the first instance requesting trade union leave with pay, then later requesting trade union leave without pay; this request was itself confusing, since the two requests involved a mixture of the provisions of both types of leave contained in the Regulations for Teaching Personnel); ()in a note dated  July , she indicated that she would take trade union leave without pay as of  August  and on  September, the Human Resources Department of the Ministry of Public Finance responded, indicating that the request could not be granted, since special leave as provided under section  of the Regulations for Teaching Personnel was appropriate; () the Regulations for Teaching Personnel do not provide for trade union leave without pay; in section , they provide for trade union leave and in section , for special leave without pay; () Ms Quattropani abandoned her teaching post on  August  without first ensuring that the administrative measures granting her any type of leave had been implemented; () at the same time as requesting trade union leave, Ms Quattropani applied for a judicial measure, which included a measure for no new action dated  April , prohibiting any action that might alter or modify the state of the claim in law or in fact, as prescribed by law (this case is currently before court No. of the Third Civil Commercial and Mining Court of the First Judicial District of San Luis province, and is docketed under: Quattropani Mara Ins c/Ministerio de Educacin y otros s/ amparo?; () since legal proceedings involving another branch of the State have been launched concerning this issue, it is necessary to await the judiciarys decision and ruling on the case, not only because that is appropriate in a State subject to the rule of law, but also because there is a judicial measure that specifically requires that this be the case; and () the teacher concerned has another post in the San Luis province judiciary, and this situation not only violates article  of the provincial Constitution and the rules on activities compatible with teaching (section  of the Teaching Regulations), but also runs counter to the very purpose of the request for the supposed trade union leave, given that trade union leave should be granted in order to enable the person concerned to adequately perform their trade union duties.
.The Committee would like to recall that Article  of Convention No.  ratified by Argentina provides that such facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognized public employees?organizations as may be appropriate in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work; and that the granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned. In this respect, the Committee takes note of the contradictory versions provided by the complainants and the provincial authorities concerning the request for trade union leave by the union leader Ms Quattropani. According to the allegations, the educational authorities of San Luis province did not respond to several requests for trade union leave with pay made by Ms Quattropani and the CTERA and that on this basis Ms Quattropani took trade union leave without pay. Noting that trade union leave is provided for in the law, and recalling that the exercise of this right must not impair the functioning and efficiency of the department concerned, and while noting that legal proceedings are under way concerning this case, the Committee expects that when the competent authorities of San Luis province issue a decision on this matter, they take into account the provisions of Article  of Convention No. . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With reference to the allegation that the ASDE, unlike other teacher trade unions, does not enjoy check-off facilities (deduction of trade union dues from wages), the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its comments on this issue. The Committee notes that according to the law ?Act No. , section  ?employers have the obligation to deduct the amounts which workers are required to pay as membership dues to workers?trade unions with recognized legal status. The Committee expects that the ASDE will benefit from the deduction of trade union dues at source for its members.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee expects that when the competent authorities of San Luis province issue a decision on Ms Quattropanis taking trade union leave without pay, they take into account the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b)	The Committee expects that the ASDE will benefit from the deduction of trade union dues at source for its members.",3,2011,Argentina
102,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated April  from the Confederation of Workers of Argentina (CTA), the Trade Union Federation of Health Professionals of the Argentine Republic (FESPROSA) and the Trade Union Association of Health Professionals of Buenos Aires Province (CICOP). FESPROSA and the CTA presented new allegations in a communication dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations by communication received on  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated April , the CTA, FESPROSA and CICOP state that they are submitting a formal complaint against the Government of Argentina for the violation of Convention No.  through actions that restrict the right to strike and are discriminatory.
.The complainants state that CICOP is a first-level trade union, legal registration No., whose scope of activity covers the whole territory of Buenos Aires Province. CICOP is affiliated to FESPROSA (a second-level organization, legal registration No.) and the CTA (a third-level organization, legal registration No. ).
.According to the complainants, the present complaint is in response to conduct of the Government of Buenos Aires Province that violates the rights established in ILO Conventions Nos , , ,  and . The complainants consider that the following violations have occurred:(a)	The Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires Province, by decision No. / of November , issued a threat, without any authority to do so, in response to the direct industrial action undertaken by the unions in the hospitals and health centres of the province, that it would impose salary deductions on workers who took part in strike days, thereby impinging on the free exercise of the right to strike, in clear violation of the legislation in force and the principles of the ILO. In this way, it violated the right to decide whether or not to participate in the strike action called by the trade union.(b)	On  March , in the context of union action called by CICOP, the Provincial Directorate of Hospitals, which comes under the Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires Province, sent a memorandum to the directors of all hospitals in the province requesting them to state which workers among those whose names appeared on a list ?consisting exclusively of CICOP members ?were working as normal, with a view to taking disciplinary measures against those who were reported as failing to do so. According to the complainants, this constitutes clear interference and harassment with regard to the union and its members.
.The complainants report that, on  November , the Executive Authority of Buenos Aires Province, by joint decision of the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers (No. ), the Minister of Government (No. ), the Minister for Economic Affairs (No. ), the Minister for Justice (No. ), the Minister for Security (No. ), the Minister for Production (No. ), the Minister for Agriculture (No. ), the Minister for Infrastructure (No. ), the Minister for Social Development (No. ), the Minister for Labour (No.), the Secretary-General for Governance (No. ), the Secretary for Human Rights (No. ), the Secretary for Sport (No. ), the Secretary for Tourism (No. ), the Executive Director of the Provincial Organization for Sustainable Development (No.), the President of the Institute of Culture (No. ) and the Director-General for Culture and Education (No. ), ruled that ?.. the absences of provincial government employees resulting from the exercise of the right to strike and not justified on any of the grounds established by the regulations in force will be subject to salary deductions for the month in question ...? According to the complainants, the arbitrary and intimidatory approach on the part of the authority constitutes an obstruction to the regular exercise of the legally protected right to strike. It also impinges on the collective and individual will of those supporting the strike measures called by the trade union.
.The union action taken by CICOP on various occasions related to pay disputes and to talks concerning the working environment and conditions of work for all health professionals in Buenos Aires Province. The aforementioned action can take various forms, including assemblies, protests and strikes. It is at the assemblies that decisions are taken regarding the duration and nature of the action, and this information is then duly communicated to the relevant bodies. To date, the forceful measures taken have not been described as illegal by any judicial authority. In this context, the provincial Executive, far from trying to settle the dispute through negotiation, is seeking to delay any solution and has adopted an intimidatory measure which violates the legitimate right to strike.
.The complainants assert that since the adoption of the abovementioned decision and until very recently, the Government of Buenos Aires Province effected salary deductions for strike days in just a few specific and limited cases but refrained from doing so systematically and en masse in view of the various labour disputes and union action measures that occurred in that period. The threat to do so in future is clearly intended to restrict the exercise of the right to strike, undoubtedly in the awareness of the intrinsic illegality of the measure. However, the situation has now changed drastically. As part of a labour dispute which started in early March  and because of the failure to reach agreement on salaries during collective bargaining in the sector, the CICOP congress of delegates decided to take union action in all hospitals in the province on  and  March , with further action to follow if no agreement was reached. In response to this, the day before the action ( March), the Provincial Directorate of Hospitals ?which comes under the Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires Province ?sent a memorandum to the directors of all hospitals under its authority, stating that the Ministry, pursuant to decision No. /, would affect salary deductions from employees taking part in the union action called by CICOP. The complainants reiterate that no provincial or national administrative authority for labour matters has instructed CICOP to abandon its measures and engage in negotiations. The measures which have been implemented have not been deemed illegal by any judicial authority.
.On  March, the President of CICOP sent a letter to the Minister of Health of Buenos Aires Province and to the Provincial Director of Hospitals, which read as follows:We have taken note of a memorandum issued on  March  by the Provincial Directorate of Hospitals of this Ministry, informing the authorities of various hospitals in the province that the relevant department will make salary deductions from employees who take part in the union action planned by CICOP for  and  March. The purpose of the present letter is to point out to the Minister that such a measure is based on grounds that are legally erroneous and therefore unconstitutional, so that you may review the decision and cancel the illegal deduction measure proposed therein. According to the correct legal view, which we hereby uphold, strike days cannot be deemed equivalent to days not worked, as if it was a question ?among other things ?of a unilateral decision made by the health workers. It is not an arbitrary act of volition; a strike is a measure to which we, the health workers, are bound to have recourse in view of the lack of a solution to the labour and public welfare issues raised by our sector. The right to strike exists without any limitations or restrictions and it cannot be deemed equivalent, as incorrectly claimed in the measure referred to above, to individual absence from work. While the first type of action, of a collective nature, is governed primarily by the National Constitution and the Constitution of Buenos Aires Province, and also by ILO Convention No.  and others related to it, the second type of action, of an individual, isolated and sporadic nature, of not attending work, whether in the public or private sector, which consequently does not qualify for remuneration, is governed by individual labour law and public or private employment laws, as the case may be. The strike with assemblies in the workplace which we are obliged to conduct is the result of non-compliance by the provincial Government, our employer, which you represent, in particular with the provisions of the law governing employerworker negotiations, as well as with article  of the Constitution of Buenos Aires Province, a fact that can solely be ascribed to the State. Local and national jurisprudence, in the cases of teachers, government employees and officials of the judiciary, repeatedly and systematically support the obligation of the State to refrain from making salary deductions for strike days, on the basis of the legal grounds set forth above. For all the above reasons, Minister, we call for the review that this case would appear to merit. We hope to be informed within  hours of receipt of the present communication that the erroneous and illegal approach in",0,2011,Argentina
103,"ordering deductions for strike days has been modified. Your silence with regard to our request will be construed as a refusal in legal terms, and recourse will be had to the corresponding legal channels in order to secure application of the National Constitution and the Constitution of Buenos Aires Province (CD Nos  and , copies of which are attached).
.To date, no reply to these communications has been received. Meanwhile, on  March, while the union action was taking place as planned, the Provincial Directorate of Hospitals sent a new memorandum to all hospital directors, ordering them to provide, the following day, a list of the employees who were exercising their legitimate constitutional right to strike, with a view to making salary deductions. The memorandum read as follows:With reference to note No. , please find attached the list of professionals in your department. Kindly send particulars of workers on active duty or on call on  and March. Any persons off duty or on vacation, or on sick leave, ART leave [for occupational accident or disease] or any other official leave that constitutes an exemption from any deduction, should be taken off the list. The non-extendable deadline for providing this information, in order to avoid the imposition of deductions, is . hours on March .
.In other words, in order to determine which workers should be subjected to the illegal salary deduction, the Ministry of Health takes it for granted that only CICOP members take part in union action ?when in reality such action usually has total support from health professionals in the province, whether or not they are union members ?and also presumes that all members take part in union action unless evidence is provided to the contrary.
.The complainants state that, in view of this escalation of the dispute, the President of CICOP sent a letter to the Minister of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which read as follows:On the day concerned, the Minister of Health of Buenos Aires Province sent a circular to all directors of hospitals under his authority ordering them to provide, the following day, a list of employees who were exercising their legitimate constitutional right to strike. This memorandum, which is already of a serious nature since the publication of the text amounts to a threat against fully exercising the right to strike, can only be described as blatant discrimination, inasmuch as the circular came with a list containing only the names of members of our union. I call on the authority that the State has conferred on you to find the means to preserve the exercise of the rights established in the National Constitution with regard to labour matters and we request you to adopt the corresponding measures to stop this illegal conduct, since the threat of deductions, together with the dispatch of a specific list of workers who would then be liable to such harassment, constitutes conduct that is no longer governed by the rule of law. Without prejudice to the above, our union has its own contribution to make, taking the corresponding legal action against those responsible for the intimidatory text, and also personally against those in the hospitals who implement the illegal instructions.
.According to the complainants, in decision No. /, the Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires Province states that the absences of provincial government employees resulting from exercise of the right to strike and not justified on any of the grounds provided for by the regulations in force will be subject to salary deductions for the month in question ...? The interference of the provincial Executive, obliging those in charge of hospital units to send a copy of the list of CICOP members, and the threat to make salary deductions for strike days imply a clear violation of freedom of association, and of the right to strike and to engage in collective bargaining, inasmuch as the strike is part of the context of negotiations concerning pay and conditions of work.
.The complainants add that this deduction is a form of retaliation and an indication of what must be regarded as a discriminatory penalty, being imposed on persons exercising what is constitutionally defined as a fundamental right. This is incompatible with Convention No., as are the threat of pay deductions from workers for taking part in a strike and the intimidatory request, the day before the strike, for a list of members of the union calling the strike.
.In their communication of  June , FESPROSA and the CTA state that FESPROSA is a second-level organization registered as a union since  with a membership of , public health professionals in  provinces. The complainants indicate that the application procedure for legal recognition of FESPROSA began on  July , file No.--, the constitution being signed by three legally recognized associations: the Association of Health Professionals of Buenos Aires Province, the Association of Health Professionals of Mendoza and the Association of Health Professionals of Salta Province.
.The complainants add that the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations referred the application to the Federation of Health Workers?Associations (FATSA), which asked for clarification of the scope of activity of FESPROSA. The latter duly replied, clarifying the scope of the legal recognition requested. FATSA sent a further request, asking for details of the scope of territory and membership, and opposed the recognition requested by FESPROSA, asking for a list of members, in order to determine which was the most representative body. FESPROSA explained that it was not seeking to incorporate all health workers but just those workers with university qualifications who were employed in public establishments, and hence was not seeking to displace FATSA, and so the latters request for the list was not appropriate.
.According to the complainants, it should be noted that in the application for legal recognition from FESPROSA there is no need to determine which is the most representative?body since there is a radial ascending?system which reflects the recognized status of first-level organizations (primary trade unions) in that of second and third-level organizations (federations, confederations or congresses), and so the latter comprise the combined representative natures of their member unions. Hence there is no reason why the Government should refuse the requested trade union recognition, especially when that criterion was already applied on many occasions by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security.
.The complainants state that after analysing the granting of legal recognition to each of the member organizations of FESPROSA, the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations issued a decision on  May  advising that the application for legal recognition from FESPROSA should be accepted. On  May , the Secretariat of Labour endorsed this opinion and referred it to the Minister of Labour with the draft decision granting legal recognition as a second-level trade union to FESPROSA. The same day,  May , the file was referred to the office of the Chief of Cabinet of the Ministry of Labour, where it has remained pending until now, despite a request being made on  December  for the matter to be dealt with promptly, no reply having been received to date.
.In conclusion, the complainants state that without any doubt the Government is committing recurrent violations of Article  of ILO Convention No. , inasmuch as it is systematically restricting the workers?right to organize, in this case by failing to grant the legal recognition requested by FESPROSA.
.In its communication received on  May , the Government forwards the response of the Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires and indicates that it does not arise from the course of events and the initiated negotiations that salary deductions for non-worked days due to the exercise of the right to strike amount to a negation or restriction of the right to strike.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organizations challenge decision No. / adopted by the authorities of Buenos Aires Province stating that the absences of provincial government employees resulting from the exercise of the right to strike and not justified on any of the grounds provided for by the regulations in force will be subject to salary deductions for the month in question. The complainants allege that as part of a labour dispute it was decided to take industrial action on  and  March, with further action to follow until such time as an agreement was reached in all the provincial hospitals, and that the Provincial Directorate of Hospitals, one day before the start of the action, sent a memorandum to all hospital directors stating that pursuant to the aforementioned decision it would make salary deductions with respect to employees who took part in the union action (according to the complainants, the day after the start of the union action, the authorities requested the hospital directors in a new memorandum to provide a list of the staff exercising the right to strike). The Committee observes that the complainants claim that the dispatch of the abovementioned memoranda amounted to a threat to full enjoyment of the right to",3,2011,Argentina
104,"strike and was discriminatory in nature inasmuch as the full list of union members was also attached so that each hospital director could remove from the list those who were working as normal.
.While observing that, according to the allegations, the complainants carried out the strike and noting that they were aware of the text of decision No. / and the decision of the Provincial Directorate of Hospitals to the effect that deductions would be made for strike days, and also that the strike was not deemed illegal by the judicial authority, and that the Government indicates that it does not arise from the course of events and the initiated negotiations that salary deductions for non-worked days due to the exercise of the right to strike amount to a negation or restriction of the right to strike, the Committee recalls that it has pointed out on several occasions that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue the examination of these allegations. The Committee nevertheless recalls that, according to the allegations, the wage deductions were carried out or threatened to be carried out only in respect of the trade union members and not the other strikers. The Committee emphasizes that this would be contrary to freedom of association principles and therefore requests the Government to examine these questions with the social partners so as to ensure respect for the principke of non-discrimination among workers.
.As regards the allegations that the labour administrative authority has not responded to the application for legal recognition submitted by FESPROSA in July , despite the fact that the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations and the Secretariat of Labour gave their approval in May , the Committee regrets the delay of nearly four years and urges the Government to make a decision without further delay in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to make a decision without further delay regarding the application for legal recognition submitted by FESPROSA.",3,2011,Argentina
105,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras ?] and, on that occasion: (i) requested the Government to keep it informed of the final rulings handed down in relation to the cases mentioned concerning the lifting of the trade union immunity of the Association of State Workers (ATE) delegates, Mr Jorge Mora Pastor, Ms Susana Ins Bentez, Mr Carlos Sal de Jess Flores, Mr Oscar Ricardo Ochoa and Mr Jos Esteban Piazza; and (ii) encouraged the Government to take increased measures to promote collective bargaining in the Teatro Coln, with the intervention of the ATE, and to keep it informed of any new collective agreements concluded.
.In communications dated  May  and  February , the Government provides information on the current status of the court cases brought against various ATE union leaders and delegates, and states that: (i) on  September , the application filed by the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (GCBA) with the Supreme Court of Justice against the decision rejecting the extraordinary federal appeal lodged by the Government, concerning the ruling that settled the summary trial between the GCBA and Mximo Parpagnoli, was declared irreceivable; (ii) on  August , the application filed by Mr Jorge Pastor Mora with the Supreme Court of Justice was rejected, confirming the exclusion of protection for Mr Pastor Mora; (iii) on  December , the expiry of the authority in the case brought by the GCBA against Ms Ins Susana Bentez, by decision of the National Chamber of Appeals, was confirmed; (iv) on  October , the ruling of the National Chamber of Labour Appeals was confirmed, excluding protection for Mr Carlos Alejandro Sal de Jess, owing to the extraordinary federal appeal lodged by the defendant being rejected; (v) on  August , the Supreme Court of Justice rejected the application filed in the GCBA proceedings against Mr Oscar Ricardo Ochoa; and (vi) on  August , the Supreme Court of Justice rejected the application filed in the GCBA proceedings against Mr Jos Esteban Piazza. The Committee notes this information.
.The Committee observes that the Government has not, by contrast, provided any information on the promotion of increased measures for the inclusion of the ATE in the collective bargaining of the Teatro Coln, nor on the conclusion of new collective agreements within that institution. In the absence of new information from the complainant for a period of many years, the Committee reiterates its hope that the ATE will not be excluded from the negotiations on the working conditions of workers at the Teatro Coln, and will not pursue its examination of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it made the following recommendation [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government to send its response concerning the additional information provided by the Association of State Workers (ATE) and, in particular, to keep it informed about the result of the appeals relating to the lifting of the trade union immunity of two ATE trade union officials (Mr Mximo Parpagnoli and Mr Pastor Mora). Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about the status of the five other trade union delegates who had also allegedly been the object of legal action to lift their trade union immunity.
.Furthermore, in its report of March , the Committee requested the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the ATE is not excluded from bargaining on the conditions of employment of workers of the Teatro Coln autonomous body [see rd Report, para. ].
.In its communications of October  and May , the Government sends the replies transmitted by the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and by the Directorate-General for Labour Relations of the Ministry of Modernization of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, indicating that: () as regards union official Mr Mximo Parpagnoli, in a decision dated  August , Chamber I of the Labour Court of Appeals overturned a ruling of the court of first instance, dismissing the application for the lifting of his trade union immunity; and () as regards the union official Mr Jorge Mora Pastor, in a decision dated  March , Chamber X of the Labour Court of Appeals ratified the ruling of the court of first instance which upheld the application for the lifting of his trade union immunity; the Government adds that a ruling issued by that same court on  August , dismissed the extraordinary federal appeal filed by Mr Jorge Mora Pastor against the aforementioned ruling. In response, the defendant filed an appeal before the Supreme Court of Justice, which is still pending.
.As regards the status of the other five union officials, who had been the subject of legal action to lift their trade union immunity, the Government indicates the following:?as regards the official Ms Susana Ins Bentez, the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (GCBA) filed an application to lift her trade union immunity, which is being heard by Labour Court of First Instance No.  of the Federal Capital, and is currently at the evidence stage;?as regards the official Mr Carlos Sal de Jess Flores, who is the subject of an application for the lifting of his trade union immunity that is being heard by Labour Court No.  of the ordinary courts of the Federal Capital, on  March  a ruling was handed down that has not to date been notified;?as regards the official Mr Oscar Ricardo Ochoa, who is the subject of an application for the lifting of his trade union immunity that is being heard by Labour Court of First Instance No.  of the ordinary courts of the Federal Capital, on  March  a ruling was handed down dismissing the application to lift his trade union immunity; as a result, the GCBA filed an appeal against this ruling, but this was dismissed. An extraordinary appeal was filed and rejected. A complaint filed before the Supreme Court of Justice is still pending;?as regards the official Dr Silvia Patricia Prez, who is the subject of an application for the lifting of her trade union immunity that is being heard by Labour Court of First Instance No.  of the ordinary courts of the Federal Capital, on  February , the request was declared not applicable given that the defendant was deceased;?as regards the official Mr Jos Esteban Piazza, who is the subject of an application for the lifting of his trade union immunity that is being heard by Labour Court of First Instance No.  of the ordinary courts of the Federal Capital, on  September  a ruling was handed down dismissing the application to lift his trade union immunity; an appeal was brought against the ruling, which upheld the ruling handed down at first instance. On  November  a complaint was filed before the Supreme Court of Justice, which was dismissed on  February . An appeal has been filed and is currently still pending resolution.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of the final rulings handed down in relation to the cases concerning the lifting of the trade union immunity of ATE members Mr Jorge Mora Pastor, Ms Susana Ins Bentez, MrCarlos Sal de Jess Flores, Mr Oscar Ricardo Ochoa and Mr Jos Esteban Piazza.
.As regards the allegations of the ATE concerning its exclusion from the collective bargaining process in the Teatro Coln autonomous body, the Committee notes that the Government highlights that the workers of said theatre are covered under the collective labour agreement signed by the GCBA and the ATE in , and by the succeeding wage agreements signed by these same parties.
.Taking into consideration that the collective agreement referred to by the Government was signed in  and that, in its previous communications, the ATE had referred to non-compliance with court rulings handed down in , which provided that the Government of the City of Buenos Aires should continue to bargain collectively in the Teatro Coln and that the ATE should be involved, the Committee encourages the Government to take increased measures, with ATE involvement, to promote collective bargaining in the Teatro Coln and to keep it informed of any new collective agreements concluded.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see rd Report, paras?], when it made the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the ATE is not excluded from bargaining on the conditions of employment of workers of the Teatro Coln autonomous body.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps ?including amendments to the legislation if necessary ?to ensure that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal lies not with the Government but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the judicial decision with regard to the application for",-1,2011,Argentina
106,"the lifting of the trade union immunity of the eight ATE officers sanctioned with termination and to indicate whether the allegations of suspension of other workers have been subject to judicial proceedings.
.In a communication dated  November , the Government sent the reply submitted by the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (GCBA), which indicated: ()with regard to recommendation (a), the GCBA confirms its commitment to include in collective bargaining all trade unions recognized on the basis of their membership, in accordance with international labour standards, and consequently the Association of State Workers (ATE) was involved in the negotiations held in respect of the City of Buenos Aires that resulted in the collective labour agreement concluded in , which is applicable to all workers in the executive power; () with regard to recommendation (b), the recommendation has been noted and the possibility will be evaluated of setting up an independent body that can take responsibility for declaring strikes illegal or not; and () in a ruling issued in September , the judicial authority denied the request of the administrative authority to lift the trade union immunity (protection that prevents dismissal) of one trade union official.
.In a communication dated  March , the ATE states that the Committees recommendations were ignored, and it specifically alleges: () non-compliance with judicial rulings of  and  which provided that the Government of the City of Buenos Aires should continue to bargain collectively in the Teatro Coln and that the ATE should be involved; and () that although National Labour Court No.  ruled against the request to lift the trade union immunity of one trade union official, other courts, in violation of the National Constitution and international treaties, granted requests to lift the trade union immunity of two trade union officials (according to the complainants, these rulings were appealed and are currently pending before the National Labour Appeals Tribunal).
.The Committee takes note of all the information sent by the Government and the additional information provided by the ATE. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to send its response concerning the additional information provided by the ATE and, in particular, to keep it informed about the result of the appeals relating to the lifting of the trade union immunity of two ATE trade union officials (Mr Mximo Parpagnoli and MrPastor Mora). Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about the status of the five other trade union delegates who had also allegedly been the object of legal action to lift their trade union immunity.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of State Workers (ATE) dated  February . The ATE sent additional information in a communication dated  September .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  February , the ATE stated that it was presenting a complaint against the Government of Argentina for violation of ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and  because of numerous violations of freedom of association committed by the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (GCBA), namely: (a) violation of the principle of bargaining in good faith; (b) the declaration by the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires that the strike at the Teatro Coln autonomous body was illegal; and (c)sanctions and disciplinary proceedings against theatre workers for industrial action and for their participation in trade union activity.
.The ATE is a first-level trade union active throughout Argentina and an affiliate of the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA). The ATE adds that article bis of the Argentine Constitution guarantees trade unions the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike as fundamental rights. The second indent of article , paragraph , accords constitutional status to a number of international human rights treaties, including the  New York Covenants, thereby granting the same status to Convention No.  (Article , paragraph , of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and Article , paragraph , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). This circle of protection of freedom of association is made complete by the first paragraph of article () of the national constitution, which grants supra-legal status to other international treaties, including the ILO Conventions. Act No.  of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires guarantees the right of state workers to collective bargaining. Moreover, section  of the Act provides that ILO Conventions are a source of regulation of public employment relationships within the Executive of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.
.The ATE states that, despite this formal protection of the right to collective bargaining, the GCBA, during collective wage bargaining with civil servants, practised discrimination, and obstructed and ultimately abandoned collective bargaining with that organization, in addition to imposing sanctions on the workers of the Teatro Coln autonomous body for legitimately exercising their right to strike. The ATE has been seeking a resolution to a dispute over conditions of employment and wage increases in the Teatro Coln autonomous body ever since the theatre reopened on  May . In this context, and in the light of the many wage demands to which the employer has failed to respond, the ATE decided to carry out industrial action in the theatre.
.The ATE adds that on  October , compulsory conciliation was ordered by the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires with a view to holding collective bargaining meetings on working conditions, the requested wage increase, and the new administrative career and grade structure of workers of the Teatro Coln autonomous body. As a result, conciliation hearings were held (as may be seen from the attached records) under file No. ../ of the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, culminating on  December  with the failure of GCBA representatives to appear. According to the ATE, the Ministry of Finance of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, in an utterly inappropriate attempt to defuse the conflict, while the abovementioned negotiations were under way, and disregarding the principle of bargaining in good faith, issued decision No./GCBA/MHGC/ granting a bonus equal to half of the end-of-year bonus, which was rejected by the ATE.
.The ATE states that, notwithstanding the bargaining process, the representatives of the authorities told a gathering of workers that they did not intend to reach an agreement on the grounds that there were no funds available for wage increases at the theatre. On December , the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires informed the ATE of decisions Nos /SSTR/ and /SSTR/, under file No. ../, in which the industrial action on  and  November  was declared illegal. The ATE promptly appealed against the decisions on the grounds that the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour does not have jurisdiction to declare a strike illegal and this constitutes an act of interference by the State as the employer. Notwithstanding the above, and displaying its willingness to bargain in good faith, the ATE on  December  appeared before the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour with the intention of pursuing the negotiations that had begun, but the authorities failed to do likewise and broke off all talks with the ATE.
.At the same time as the negotiations were being abandoned and the industrial action on and  November  was declared illegal, the Director-General and Artistic Manager of Teatro Coln initiated administrative proceedings to determine who was responsible for the industrial action and, pursuant to decision No. /EATC/, suspended eight workers who were ATE officers, thereby violating their trade union immunity enshrined in Act No.  and article bis of the national constitution. As if that were not enough,early in the new year decisions Nos /EATC/, /EATC/ and /EATC/ were issued suspending additional theatre workers and extending the suspensions of the officials who were already suspended.
.The discriminatory situation subsequently worsened when, on  January , representatives of the employer, the GCBA, met with representatives of the Union of State Workers of the City of Buenos Aires (SUTECBA) ?the other trade union with official trade union status with regard to the GCBA ?and, within the framework of sectoral collective bargaining in Teatro Coln, an agreement was signed whereby a number of workers with permanent contracts were reinstated, excluding the ATE. At the same time, eight of the ten trade union officials on the ATE internal board were suspended for days, the clear intention being to prevent them from working at Teatro Coln while the collective bargaining process was being completed.
.The ATE reports that appeals were lodged against the suspensions, and intervention by the National Labour Court was requested in order to",-1,2011,Argentina
107,"obtain a stay of execution of the suspensions. Accordingly, four interim measures were issued (with orders for reinstatement) in favour of the trade union officials in the cases of Piazza, Jos Estaban v. GCBA interim measure?(Case No. ./), Piazza, Jos Estaban v. GCBA in re interim measure?(Case No. /), Parpagnoli, Mximo v. GCBA in re interim measure?(Case No. /) and Tonazzi, Mara Sara v. GCBA in re interim measure?(Case No./), but the Government and the Teatro Coln autonomous body did not comply with them.
.At a press conference held by the manager of Teatro Coln on  January , a collective agreement with SUTECBA was announced. Under the agreement, there would be a wage increase in line with the theatres productivity in , and the theatre undertook to negotiate on the grade and/or administrative career structure in the near future. The ATE points out that the SUTECBA issued an official statement saying that on  January  ?following joint sectoral negotiations within Teatro Coln, and in the absolute conviction that the only valid way to achieve concrete agreements that benefit all colleagues at the theatre is through dialogue in a spirit of mutual respect and collaboration, this trade union delegation is announcing the scope of the points of agreement reached so far. This is a first step towards restoring the reputation of Teatro Coln, and the salaries commensurate with this status ...?
.Furthermore, the Director-General and Artistic Manager officially announced the collective agreement from which the ATE had been excluded, and told the media that this is a groundbreaking agreement because it not only deals with the wage issue but also paves the way for a future where the theatre flourishes and the public can fully enjoy the Coln? The human resources secretary of the GCBA added that these people have jeopardized the theatre and tried everything to keep its doors closed, then attempted to discredit each and every one of the actions we have taken?
.According to the ATE, the position adopted by the Government constitutes a systematic violation of freedom of association, collective bargaining, the separation of powers and trade union representation in at least the following ways: Firstly, the declaration that the strike was illegal was made without the slightest authority and constituted an attempt to violate recognized constitutional and international law. Secondly, there has been a denial of the right to free collective bargaining with the ATE since an agreement was reached with only one of the trade unions entitled to bargain, thereby violating the principle of bargaining in good faith, and discriminating against one of the representative unions. Thirdly, in the midst of a conflict, sanctions were imposed on the workers and officers of the ATE for participating in the strike.
.In its communication dated  September , the ATE reported that, pursuant to the ruling of  August , in the case of Association of State Workers et al. v. GCBA in re amparo proceedings? the GCBA was fined , Argentine pesos (ARS) for failing to comply with the ruling concerning the interim measure ordering the Teatro Coln autonomous body to abstain from continuing with collective bargaining. The ATE adds that decision No. /EATC/ issued by the Teatro Coln autonomous body aggravated the violation of freedom of association since it caused eight officials of that organization to be dismissed as a sanction for having exercised their right to strike (according to the decision, the sanction was imposed because artistic activities had been suspended without justifiable cause; the sanction was enforced by the Attorney-Generals Office which intervened by filing a judicial application to lift the trade union immunity provided for in the Trade Union Associations Act).
.In its communication dated  November , the Government states that it consulted the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, which informed it of the following:.	Regarding the dispute in the context of collective bargaining and the illegality of the strike, the labour authority of the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires(GCBA) states that the industrial action paralysed the activities of the Teatro Coln autonomous body, that it did so suddenly and without prior notice, and at a time when collective bargaining was under way and compulsory conciliation had been ordered. The complainant trade union had agreed to comply with it and committed itself to continued dialogue in the record of the hearing. In this context, the workers involved waited until the entire audience was seated in the theatre before occupying the stage and preventing the performance from going ahead. The theatre had to be cleared, tickets had to be refunded and claims for compensation were received from catering franchisees, the artists and their representatives because of the loss of earnings resulting from the cancellation of the performance. It should also be noted that the decisions in question clearly comply with existing national and local law. That being so, the Attorney Generals Office intervened to authorize the dismissal of the trade union representatives involved in the events since they are covered by trade union immunity under Act No...	Sanctions and terminations: the termination of the workers and the corresponding decision are based on the prior administrative proceedings initiated in  to determine the responsibilities of the staff and/or workers directly or indirectly involved in the industrial action that caused the suspension of the activities of the Teatro Coln autonomous body on  and  November , and/or was prejudicial to the GCBA..	Opinion of the Attorney-Generals Office: administrative proceedings No. /. Following an assessment of the facts and evidence, it was concluded that the conduct of one group of workers warranted the sanction of termination, and in other cases the charges were dismissed. The legitimate right of defence guaranteed in the civil service was observed throughout the proceedings. The workers involved remain in their jobs pending a decision on the legal action on lifting trade union immunity..	The judicial fine referred to in the supplemental submission is unrelated to the conflict that led to the termination of the workers and is currently being appealed before a higher court.Lastly, neither the Teatro Coln autonomous body nor any other part of the city Government has violated any ILO Convention or national law. On the contrary, due process has been respected.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the ATE alleges bad faith and claims that it was excluded from the collective bargaining process in the Teatro Coln autonomous body. The ATE also objects to the declaration by the GCBA that a strike by the workers of the theatre on  and  November  was illegal, and to the suspension and subsequent termination of eight ATE officials.
.Firstly, the Committee observes that the Government states that in its reply it forwards the information provided by the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.
.Regarding the allegation of bad faith and exclusion from the collective bargaining process in the Teatro autonomous body (according to the complainant, after the process of negotiation with ATE was abandoned, an agreement was concluded with SUTECBA, from which the ATE was excluded), the Committee notes that the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires states that the complainant trade union took industrial action that paralysed the activities of the Teatro, and that it did so suddenly and without prior notice, and at a time when collective bargaining was under way and compulsory conciliation had been ordered. In this regard, the Committee observes that the Government does not refer to the issue of the exclusion of the ATE from collective bargaining for a sectoral agreement in the Teatro. The Committee observes that, regarding this issue, it appears from the documentation transmitted by the complainant organization that the judicial authorities of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires: ()noted that the Sectoral Bargaining Committee of the Teatro held a meeting at which the ATE was not represented and consequently, on  February , decided on an interim measure ordering the GCBA and the Teatro to refrain from conducting collective bargaining unless the ATE was included; and () having learned that the Teatro had disregarded the interim measure and held a meeting with SUTECBA on  June  in order to agree on payment for the maintenance of the orchestras musical instruments, fined the GCBA , Argentine pesos (according to the GCBA, an appeal has been lodged against this decision).
.The Committee regrets that the Teatro has failed to comply with the interim measure ordered by the judicial authority and excluded the ATE from the collective bargaining process. The Committee emphasizes the principle that employers, including governmental authorities in the capacity of employers, should recognize for collective bargaining purposes the organizations representative of the workers employed by them?and also recalls that it is important that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement; moreover genuine and constructive negotiations are a necessary component to establish and maintain a relationship of confidence between the parties?[see Digest of decisions and principles of",-1,2011,Argentina
108,"the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the ATE is not excluded from bargaining on the conditions of employment of workers of the Teatro.
.As regards the alleged declaration by the GCBA that a strike by the workers of the theatre on  and  November  was illegal, the Committee also notes that it is clear from the documentation transmitted by the complainant organization that the GCBA: () instructed the complainant organization to abandon any current or planned direct action throughout the bargaining period; and () declared that the industrial action of  November  was illegal on the grounds that it had taken place during the bargaining period, and that the industrial action of  November  was also illegal on the grounds that it had violated the agreement between the parties under the compulsory conciliation process. The Committee also notes that the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires states that: () the industrial action paralysed the activities of the Teatro, and that it did so suddenly and without prior notice, and at a time when collective bargaining was under way and compulsory conciliation had been ordered; () the complainant organization had agreed to comply with that order and committed itself to continued dialogue; () the workers involved in the strike had waited until the entire audience was seated in the theatre before occupying the stage and preventing the performance from going ahead; and () the theatre had to be cleared, tickets had to be refunded and claims for compensation had been received from catering franchisees and the artists. In this regard, while taking note of the criticism of the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires suggesting that the complainant organization failed to obey the law, the Committee recalls that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the Government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved?[see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps ?including amendments to the legislation if necessary ?to ensure that this principle is respected.
.Regarding the alleged suspension and subsequent sanction by termination (by decision No./EATC/ issued by the Teatro) of eight ATE officers and other workers for participation in the strikes on  and  November , the Committee notes that the Undersecretary of Labour of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires states that: () the dismissal decisions are based on the prior administrative proceedings initiated in  to determine the responsibilities of the staff and/or workers directly or indirectly involved in the industrial action that caused the suspension of the activities of Teatro; () following an assessment of the facts and evidence, it was concluded that the conduct of one group of workers warranted the sanction of termination, and in other cases the charges were dismissed; () the legitimate right of defence guaranteed in the civil service was respected throughout the proceedings; and () the workers in question remain in their jobs pending a decision on the legal action on lifting trade union immunity (pursuant to an administrative decision, the Attorney-Generals Office intervened by filing a legal action to lift their trade union immunity under Act No.  on trade unions). Observing that, according to the administrative decision in question, it is now incumbent upon the judicial authorities to rule on whether to lift the trade union immunity of the eight ATE officers sanctioned with termination, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision taken with regard to this issue, as well as to indicate whether the allegations of suspension of other workers have been subject to judicial proceedings.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the ATE is not excluded from bargaining on the conditions of employment of workers of the Teatro Coln autonomous body.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps ?including amendments to the legislation if necessary ?to ensure that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal lies not with the Government but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the judicial decision with regard to the application for the lifting of the trade union immunity of the eight ATE officers sanctioned with termination and to indicate whether the allegations of suspension of other workers have been subject to judicial proceedings.",-1,2011,Argentina

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that at its March  meeting, when it examined the complaints regarding the refusal of enterprises in the railways sector to engage in collective bargaining, as well as acts of anti-union harassment and persecution, it made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee firmly expects that the necessary steps will be taken so that the Ministry can, without delay, take an appropriate decision with regard to the requests for recognition of representativeness that it has received, and so that the representative workers?organizations and companies in the railways sector can regulate conditions of employment by means of collective bargaining.(b)	The Committee firmly urges the Government to send its observations without delay on the following recommendations that it made at its meeting in November : (a) the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings with respect to unfair labour practices filed with regard to the alleged threats of dismissal of members of the APDFA and with respect to the sanction imposed on delegate Mr Daro Corbaln in the Ferrovas SA enterprise; and (b) the Committee regrets the Governments considerable delay in responding and urges it to carry out an investigation into the following allegations of anti-union discrimination: () pressure on members to leave the union; refusal to recognize the election of delegates and to engage in dialogue with elected delegates; refusal to provide a notice board; prohibition of trade union assemblies and denial of trade union leave at Ferrosur SA; () denial of the legality of the trade union election procedure and refusal to recognize elected delegates at Amrica Latina Logstica Central and at Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica ; and () threats of dismissal of members at Ferrovas SA. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of the investigation.
.In its communication of  June , and in respect of Committee recommendation(a)(concerning the Ministry making decisions with regard to the requests for recognition of representativeness made by various representative workers?organizations and enterprises in the railways sector to enable them to regulate conditions of employment by means of collective bargaining), the Government stated that the Ministry of Labours National Directorate of Trade Union Associations made the relevant decisions regarding the requests for recognition of trade union representativeness in decisions dated  April . The Government attached a copy of the decisions, in which the trade union representativeness of the senior staff officers in various enterprises, including enterprises A?and C? is defined. The Government also attached a copy of a decision dated November  in which the request for the recognition of the trade union representativeness of enterprise B?was rejected because the enterprises request involved the reclassification of workers, a matter that it was not for the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations to resolve.
.In its communication of  May  and in respect of Committee recommendation(a)(specifically the possibility for representative workers?organizations and companies in the railways sector to regulate conditions of employment by means of collective bargaining), the Government stated that the Association of Management Staff of the Argentine Railways and General Ports Administration (APDFA) (the complainant organization) had concluded a wage agreement with enterprise (A), which was approved by a decision dated  March , and also four other agreements with the same enterprise, which were approved in  and registered as Nos /, /, / and /. The Government further states that the APDFA also negotiated agreements with enterprises C?and D? which were approved by decision No. /.
.In its communications dated  April and September , the Government stated that while it had been able to locate two judicial proceedings in which the APDFA had been involved, they had been shelved owing to lack of movement since  and , and consequently it had requested that they be reactivated.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states that the National Labour Court ruled against enterprise D? overturning the dismissal, ordering the reinstatement of the trade union delegate Mr Ramn Daro Alcaraz, and ordering the enterprise to pay the outstanding wages.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations that were still pending when the Committee examined this case at its meeting in March  related to the decisions to be made by the Ministry in respect of the requests for recognition of representativeness made by various workers?organizations to enable them to regulate terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements (recommendation (a)) as well as to acts of harassment and persecution of the members and delegates of the Association of Management Staff of the Argentine Railways and General Ports Administration (APDFA) (the complainant organization) (recommendation (b)).
.The Committee takes note of the various communications sent by the Government relating to recommendation (a) from the previous examination of the case and in respect of which the Government states that: (i) in decisions dated  April , the Ministry of Labours National Directorate of Trade Union Associations made the relevant decisions regarding the requests for recognition of trade union representativeness (the Government attached a copy of the decisions); (ii) the APDFA concluded agreements with three enterprises that were approved by way of ministerial decisions dated  and  (the Government attached copies of the decisions); (iii) while it had been able to locate two judicial proceedings in which the APDFA was involved, they had been shelved owing to lack of movement since  and , and consequently it had requested that they be reactivated; and (iv) the National Labour Court ruled against enterprise D? overturning the dismissal, ordering the reinstatement of the trade union delegate Mr Ramn Daro Alcaraz, and ordering the enterprise to pay the outstanding wages (which the Government had already reported on and which the Committee had taken note of in its March  report).

The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings for unfair labour practices filed with regard to the alleged threats of dismissal of APDFA members and for the sanction imposed on delegate Mr Daro Corbaln in the Ferrovas SA enterprise.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to confirm that trade union delegate Mr Ramn Daro Alcaraz, who had been dismissed from the All enterprise in violation of trade union immunity, has been reinstated without loss of pay in accordance with the order issued by the judicial authority.(d)	The Committee regrets the considerable delay of the Government in responding and urges it to carry out an investigation into the following allegations of anti-union discrimination: () pressure on members to leave the union; refusal to recognize the election of delegates and to engage in dialogue with elected delegates; refusal to provide a",-1,2010,Argentina
110,"notice board; prohibition of trade union assemblies and denial of trade union leave in the Ferrosur SA enterprise; () denial of the legality of the trade union election procedure and refusal to recognize elected delegates in the Amrica Latina Logstica Central and Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica enterprises; and () threats of dismissal of members in the Ferrovas SA enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of the investigation.
.in its communication of  November  the Government states that the first point to make clear, as is obvious from the complainant organizations statement, is that the privatization of the railways in the s had direct repercussions on the occupational categories of railway workers. The fact is that privatization entailed a structural transformation of the railway companies?organizational chart, changes in the way work was organized, the disappearance of some traditional categories and the modification of others as workers were assigned new functions, or as their previous functions were discontinued. This, along with new tasks that were not covered by the collective agreement, placed these workers in a situation that can broadly be described as outside the collective agreement? The changes also caused confusion between the trade unions themselves ?the Railway Union and the Association of Management Staff of Argentine Railways and General Ports Administration (APDFA) ?and the employers, as to which workers each union represented. This in turn affected the process of collective bargaining and gave rise to a series of conflicts in the labour relations of the various companies. According to the Government, the disputes come under two clear headings: a dispute over each unions representativity, and a dispute over the rules governing collective bargaining. The institutional framework for dealing with each of these disputes is quite distinct.
.Whereas the issue of representativity is for the Ministry of Labour to decide (since ultimately what is involved here is the legal personality and individual representativity of each organization), the scope of a collective agreement is a legal matter that must be settled either in court or by the parties themselves through a process of conflict resolution.
.The issue of representativity is laid down in article  of Act No.  and, as such, is for the Ministry of Labour to rule on, albeit subject to preliminary negotiations by the unions themselves, as stipulated in the Act. However, the complainant organization does not appear to have embarked upon this initial stage of the procedure and, as a result, the matter has duly been taken up by the Ministry. This is why, in its earlier reply, the Government referred to the hearings held by the Ministry of Labour in order to seek a reconciliation between the parties and thus complete this preliminary stage. The Government states that it has no authority to rule on the scope of collective agreements because a separate category cannot be created for workers not covered by the existing agreement. That is a legal issue that calls for a court ruling or for reconciliation between the parties to the dispute.
.The Government maintains that the situation is precisely as it stated at the time: as far as the workers not covered by the agreement are concerned, either the parties involved engage a process of mediation and try to agree on the categorization of the workers, or else the aggrieved party must take the matter to court in order to assert its rights. No such action has been taken, at least as far as can be judged from the complaint. Be that as it may, the Government repeats that the issue of representativity is indeed a matter for the Ministry to decide, and this is what it has endeavoured to do. In the process, some progress has been made in determining the representativeness of the trade unions vis--vis the railway companies for purposes of collective bargaining.
.The Government states that the Railway Union requested that it be recognized as representing workers who hold supervisory or similar posts and/or who are responsible for such functions at Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica, SA (file No. /), at Ferrovas, SA (file No. /) and at Trenes de Buenos Aires, SA (file No./), and that such recognition not be extended to the APDFA. Meanwhile, the APDFA requested (file No. /) that it be recognized as representing employees who hold or are responsible for senior management, inspection, coordination, supervision and monitoring positions, with or without workers under them; and/or employees who are engaged in training and in assessing the training skills of staff working under them; and/or employees who are responsible for general and detailed planning and/or programming and/or control functions; and/or employees who are directly responsible to the company management for work carried out by workers under them; and/or employees who have disciplinary powers; and/or employees who carry out similar functions to those listed above, whether in an administrative, technical or professional capacity, or who, as holders of university diplomas, exercise their professional skills at Belgrano Cargas, SA and/or in its managing company Sociedad Operadora de Emergencias, SA (SOESA); and that such recognition not be extended to the Railway Union.
.Finally, the Government states that Ferrero Roca, SA petitioned (file No. /) that the administrative authority to engage the trade union representativeness procedure to determine which union can benefit from the special status personera general?to represent workers employed as nurses (and support staff), as members of the staff of the Olavaria medical institute, as inspectors or assistant inspector (track), as administrative technical assistants, as field technicians, as operations assistants, as warehouse clerks, as accounts analysts at the Olavaria medical institute, as accounts payable clerks, as accounts receivable clerks, as operations supervisors, as railway network controllers, as personnel distribution managers, as CCA clerks, as K warehouse assistants, as Sola area chiefs, as Sola warehouse assistants, as Cauelas warehouse chiefs, as Cauelas warehouse assistants, as support staff, as warehouse assistants for the Olavaria medical institute, as Las Flores area assistants, as Olavaria area assistants, as locomotive supervisors, as officers in charge of mechanical supplies, as assistant technicians (clerks), as railway coach supervisors, as area assistants, as fixed plant technical assistants (plant operators), as planning and budget control assistants (planning and statistics), as technical assistants at the companys premises at  avenida Prngales in Olavaria, Province of Buenos Aires, in accordance with articles (b) and (a) of Decree No. /; and lodged a complaint regarding the dispute over trade union representativeness between the Railway Union and the APDFA.
.The Government states that the whole process conformed to the wishes of the Committee, as a means of encouraging and promoting voluntary collective bargaining between the enterprises and the complainant organization.
.Finally, regarding the other points raised in the Committees recommendation, the Government states that the administrative authority has been informed that Mr Ramn Daro Alcartaz has opted for payment of compensation and has left the company. As to the other issues, information is still being gathered and will be presented in subsequent reports.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations that were still pending when the Committee examined this case at its meeting in November  concerned the refusal of a number of enterprises of the railways sector to engage in collective bargaining with the complainant (the APDFA), as well as acts of harassment and persecution of its members and delegates.
.The Committee had requested the Government to take promptly all possible measures to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of voluntary negotiation procedures by the APDFA and the enterprises concerned in the sector, with a view to regulating the conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. The Committee notes in this respect that the Government states: () that the Railway Union requested that it be recognized as representing workers who hold supervisory or similar posts and/or who are responsible for such functions at Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica, SA, at Ferrovas, SA and at Trenes de Buenos Aires, SA, and that such recognition not be extended to the APDFA; () that the APDFA meanwhile requested that it be recognized as representing employees who hold or are responsible for senior management, inspection, coordination, supervision and monitoring positions, with or without workers under them; and/or employees who are engaged in training and in assessing the training skills of staff working under them; and/or employees who are responsible for general and detailed planning and/or programming and/or control functions; and/or employees who are directly responsible to the company management for work carried out by employees working under them; and/or employees who have disciplinary powers; and/or employees who carry out similar functions to those listed above, whether in an administrative, technical or professional capacity, or employees who, as holders of university diplomas, exercise their professional skills at Belgrano Cargas, SA and/or in its managing company Sociedad Operadora de Emergencias, SA (SOESA), and that such recognition not be accorded to the Railway Union; () finally, that Ferrero Roca, SA requested that the administrative authority engage the trade union representativeness procedure to determine which occupational organization can benefit from the special status personera general?to represent various categories of employees",-1,2010,Argentina
111,"(nurses, medical staff, railway track inspectors, assistants, administrative technicians, etc.), in accordance with articles (b) and (a) of Decree No. /, and lodged a complaint regarding the dispute over trade union representativeness between the Railway Union and APDFA; ()that the issue of representativeness is laid down in article  of Act No.  and, as such, is for the Ministry of Labour to rule on, albeit subject to preliminary negotiations by the unions themselves, as stipulated in the Act; () that the complainant organization does not appear to have embarked upon this initial stage of the procedure and that, as a result, the matter has duly been taken up by the Ministry of Labour (the Government notes that, in an earlier reply, it referred to the hearings held by the Ministry of Labour to seek a reconciliation between the parties and thus complete the preliminary stage of the procedure); and () that the whole process conformed to the wishes of the Committee as a means of encouraging and promoting voluntary collective bargaining between the enterprises and the complainant organization.
.The Committee notes all this information, from which it appears that at least two trade unions have requested the Ministry of Labour to recognize them as representing several categories of employees in a number of enterprises in the railways sector. The Committee firmly expects that the necessary steps will be taken so that the Ministry can, without delay, take an appropriate decision with regard to the requests for recognition of representativeness that it has received, and so that representative workers?organizations and companies in the railways sector can regulate conditions of employment by means of collective bargaining.
.The Committee recalls that it had requested the Government to confirm that trade union delegate Mr Ramn Daro Alcaraz, who had been dismissed from the ALL company in violation of his trade union immunity, had been reinstated without loss of pay in accordance with the order issued by the judicial authority. In this respect, the Committee notes the Governments statement that the said delegate has opted for payment of compensation and has left the company.
.With regard to recommendations (b) and (d), the Committee regrets that, despite the seriousness of the allegations (exertion of pressure on trade union members to leave the union, non-recognition of the election of union delegates, threats of dismissal, etc.) dating back to , the Government merely informs it that information on the matter is still being gathered. The Committee reiterates its recommendations and firmly urges the Government to send its observations on the matter without delay.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee firmly expects that the necessary steps will be taken so that the Ministry can, without delay, take an appropriate decision with regard to the requests for recognition of representativeness that it has received, and so that the representative workers?organizations and companies in the railways sector can regulate conditions of employment by means of collective bargaining.(b)	The Committee firmly urges the Government to send its observations without delay on the following recommendations that it made at its meeting in November : (a) the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings with respect to unfair labour practices filed with regard to the alleged threats of dismissal of members of the APDFA and with respect to the sanction imposed on delegate Mr Daro Corbaln in the Ferrovas SA enterprise; and (b) the Committee regrets the Governments considerable delay in responding and urges it to carry out an investigation into the following allegations of anti union discrimination: () pressure on members to leave the union; refusal to recognize the election of delegates and to engage in dialogue with elected delegates; refusal to provide a notice board; prohibition of trade union assemblies and denial of trade union leave at Ferrosur SA; () denial of the legality of the trade union election procedure and refusal to recognize elected delegates at Amrica Latina Logstica Central and at Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica; and () threats of dismissal of members at Ferrovas SA. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of the investigation.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of Management Staff of Argentine Railways and General Ports Administration (APDFA) dated  October .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October , the APDFA states that, in accordance with the national legislation in force, the APDFA is a primary-level trade union with trade union status, pursuant to Decision No.  of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. Accordingly, the APDFA enjoys legitimacy and has the capacity to present the complaint. The APDFA states that it is presenting this complaint against the Argentine State for multiple violations of freedom of association and the rights of workers?organizations and representatives guaranteed under Conventions Nos ,  and , and Workers?Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), in the form of acts of antiunion discrimination, harassment of trade union delegates and activists, and refusal to engage in collective bargaining, among other serious violations, committed by the Ferrosur SA, Roca SA, All Central and All Mesopotmica SA, Nuevo Central Argentino SA, Ferroexpreso Pampeano SA, Belgrano Cargas SA, Ferrovas SA and Ugofe SA enterprises. It states further that the complaint describes some of the serious acts contrary to freedom of association committed by three of these enterprises (Ferrosur SA, All Central and All Mesopotmica SA, and Ferrovas SA), with the complicity of the Ministry of Labour.
.The APDFA points out that it groups together and represents all dependent employees of the railway sector working as managerial, administrative, technical and/or professional staff, university graduates holding qualifying degrees and currently performing those duties: coordinators, supervisors and all staff performing management, supervisory and control tasks, with or without subordinate staff, irrespective of their employment situation, without distinction based on occupational category, who are working in a dependent relationship in any enterprise in the sector, including state enterprises or companies at national or provincial level; public, private or mixed enterprises operating railway services; centralized or decentralized public service bodies engaged in activities related to railways; enterprises and/or bodies carrying out repairs and/or maintenance of railway equipment, control and/or operation of movable or fixed assets formerly owned by Ferrocarriles Argentinos and remaining within the remit of the State, control and/or supervision of the management and operation of railway service enterprises; employer enterprises that conclude agreements or contractual or subcontracting arrangements for the operation, sale or performance of tasks inherent in or ancillary to railway activity, industries engaged mainly in the production and/or repair of railway equipment and enterprises providing services to the railway sector. The unions coverage also includes managerial and executive staff working in Argentine ports. Its legally recognized geographical coverage is nationwide.
.The APDFAs employer was originally the State, as the owner of Ferrocarriles Argentinos, the enterprise responsible for providing railway services on the different branch lines. In the s, however, the privatization policies implemented by the then Government led to the fragmentation of the railways, with concessions being granted for operation of the railway services to several private companies, which thus became the employers of the workers represented by the trade union. The APDFA emphasizes that, under the policies carried out in the s in Argentina, nearly all of the public service enterprises formerly owned by the State were privatized. The APDFAs position was to resist and oppose the Governments decisions to privatize, and to that end it launched a propaganda and public awareness plan to inform society of the serious consequences the process would entail. In response to the APDFAs militant activities, the employers, with the acquiescence of the State, retaliated by withdrawing recognition of the unions representative status; in fact, the workers represented by the union were required to leave the trade union as a condition for being transferred to the concessionaires ?in other words, for keeping their jobs. These reprisals, which constitute a violation of freedom of association, were decided and implemented by all of the enterprises referred to in the complaint: Ferrosur SA, Roca SA, All Central and All Mesopotmica SA, Nuevo Central Argentino SA, Ferroexpreso Pampeano SA, Belgrano Cargas SA, Ferrovas SA and Ugofe SA.
.Since then, despite all the action taken by the APDFA, the union has been prevented from exercising the right to collective bargaining, notwithstanding the fact that, in accordance with the legal provisions, it initiated an administrative procedure with the Ministry of Labour requesting the establishment of a bargaining unit with all the concessionaires. By preventing collective bargaining, the employers achieved their goal: the workers covered by the relevant collective agreements while the railways were being operated by the State were removed from the scope of the agreements by the",4,2010,Argentina
112,"private companies operating each of the branch lines for which concessions were granted. An unlawful situation, in which workers covered by the APDFAs trade union status are not covered by the agreement? thus arose in all of the enterprises. Starting in , in the midst of the massive socioeconomic and political crisis, the railway managerial staff of all the concessionaires began to organize and join the APDFA, bringing pressure to bear in order to recover their former conditions of employment and push for recognition of the unions representative status in accordance with its legal and constitutional remit.
.The complainant organization states that the provisions setting out the terms of the grant of the concession and operation of each of the branch railway lines expressly provided for the obligation of the concessionaires to respect the trade unions?representative status and coverage and the conditions of employment enjoyed by the workers at the time of the transfer. Section  of Act No. , the State Reform Act, provides that: During the privatization process implemented in accordance with the provisions of this Act, through any of the modalities and procedures provided for in sections  and , the worker shall continue to be protected by all of the legal, collective agreement and administrative institutions of labour law.?Section  of the same Act provides as follows: Trade union coverage: The privatization process shall not in itself alter or change the trade union situation, coverage or membership of the workers employed by a body that is undergoing privatization, unless otherwise provided in a decision of the competent authority in the matter.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.Notwithstanding the legal provisions, the reality shows that the managerial and executive staff represented by the APDFA were illegally excluded from the coverage of the collective agreement which they previously enjoyed, while at the same time any bargaining proposals were systematically denied. The complainant organization recalls that ActNo. governing collective labour agreements provides, in section , that: The terms of collective agreements that have been certified shall be binding and may not be modified by individual employment contracts to the detriment of the workers ...? Section of the same Act provides that: In the bargaining process for an enterprise collective agreement, the workers shall be represented by the trade union with trade union status covering them ...? The Collective Bargaining Procedure Act, in section , provides that: The representative body of employers or workers which seeks to engage in bargaining shall inform the other party to that effect in writing, with a copy to the labour administrative authority, indicating: (a) the bodys representative status; (b) the geographical area and category of persons to be covered by the collective agreement sought; (c) the bargaining subject.?Section  of the Act provides that: The recipients of the communication referred to in the previous section shall reply to it and designate their representatives on the commission set up to that end.?The different national laws referring to collective bargaining, read together, thus reflect clearly and consistently the obligation of the enterprise to bargain with the trade union that has trade union status. The obligation to bargain with the trade union that has trade union status, as is the case of the APDFA, is expressly stated and is not open to interpretation.
.The APDFA alleges that it is the only trade union in the railway sector that has been prevented in practice from bargaining collectively with the different railway concessionaires. The other trade union organizations are not subjected to this arbitrary treatment, and regularly engage in collective bargaining with the enterprises in the sector ?the same enterprises that deny the APDFA the exercise of this right. The abovementioned enterprises are in breach of their duty to bargain collectively with this organization and are discriminating with regard to other trade union organizations. The APDFA refers to acts which have occurred in some of these concessionaires, in many cases with the connivance of the competent authority, and which constitute grave violations of freedom of association giving rise to the presentation of the complaint.Allegations concerning violations of freedom of association in the Ferrosur SA enterprise
.The APDFA alleges that in , the managerial and executive staff of the enterprise decided to unionize in order to improve their working conditions (hours of work exceeding the legal limits, wage arrears, stress due to constant pressure, workplace harassment, etc.) through participation and collective action. At the same time as the massive influx of members referred to above was occurring, the APDFA, by virtue of the powers recognized by Act No.  on collective bargaining and Act No.  on trade union associations, together with its implementing Decree, No. /, sought to start collective bargaining with a view to improving the situation of the enterprise employees covered by the unions scope. In response, the Ferrosur SA enterprise, after exerting considerable pressure and threatening mass dismissals, promised to improve conditions, provided the workers withdrew from membership of the union. Unfortunately, the pressure had the desired effect and all of the workers concerned left the union.
.At the same time, the enterprise began to take legal steps with regard to the Ministry of Labour, which were completely unfounded, for the sole purpose of delaying or preventing bargaining with the APDFA. It should be pointed out that the legal framework for collective bargaining in Argentina grants the capacity to engage in collective bargaining to trade unions that have been granted trade union status by the Ministry of Labour, as is the case of the APDFA, irrespective of whether the workers covered by the scope of the union as recognized by the state authority are members of that union. One of the means used by the enterprise to prevent collective bargaining was to engage in procedural manoeuvres and tactics in the administrative procedure that had been initiated in the Ministry with a view to bargaining. Faced with this situation, the APDFA had no choice but to pursue the administrative procedure to obtain a decision from the competent authority ordering the enterprise, by virtue of the powers vested in it, to bargain collectively with the trade union. As a result, the enterprise filed an appeal for reconsideration, with a subsidiary appeal to a higher administrative authority, against the ministerial decision ordering it to engage in bargaining. At the same time, the APDFA confirmed its position to the same administrative authority with which the enterprise had filed its administrative appeal.
.The administrative procedure (file No. /) was thus referred to the Executive Office of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security on  August . On  July , after a year had elapsed without the Ministry having handed down a decision, the trade union formally requested a prompt decision, in accordance with section of the Administrative Procedures Act, asking that authority to cease delaying the procedure and to expedite the collective bargaining process it had been seeking since . At the end of , the APDFA was still unable to exercise effectively the right to collective bargaining and, as a result, was denied the other rights affected by this vital aspect of freedom of association. Time has continued to pass without any change in this serious situation, and the workers in the enterprise, who have been prevented from exercising their rights to organize and bargain collectively, have reported that their working conditions not only have not improved, but have even deteriorated.
.On  November  the APDFA sent another communication notifying the Executive Office of the Ministry of Labour that its representatives in the enterprise had elected a delegate and that it had thus met the employers requirement (which, as pointed out above, was without legal basis) to the effect that it was essential to have staff delegates on the bargaining committee. At the time this complaint was presented, no decision had been received from the administrative authority either accepting or rejecting the proposal. The Ministry of Labours silence on the matter is thus again instrumental to the obstructive conduct of Ferrosur SA, in violation of national legislation and Conventions Nos  and . In January , as a way out of the impasse caused by the paralysis of the administrative procedure that should have led to collective bargaining, the APDFA initiated a new administrative procedure, which unfortunately met the same fate, as the enterprise again failed in its duty to bargain with the union and resorted to various manoeuvres to prevent the bargaining unit from even being set up.
.The APDFA adds that after the election of delegates in , the enterprise exerted all kinds of pressure to get the delegates and even the members to give up their status. As the years passed, wages and other conditions of employment deteriorated, prompting a new wave of mass unionization by the workers of the enterprise and the election of staff delegates; the enterprise responded by refusing to recognize the legality of the election of the delegates, while denying their capacity to represent the workers and hence rejecting any form of dialogue with them.
.On  July , the enterprise made",4,2010,Argentina
113,"a statement to the Ministry of Labour challenging the APDFAs call for elections on  July. It also stated that: In the event that elections are held, we declare at the outset that we challenge the appointments that might be made as a result, as the delegates elected would not be covered by any immunity or guarantee.?In what nearly amounts to an admission of its discriminatory anti-union conduct, it adds that: as regards the workforce,  workers are currently working in FSR [referring to the Ferrosur SA enterprise]. Of these,  are covered by the E?collective agreement signed with the Railway Union (Unin Ferroviaria) (UF);  are covered by the E?collective agreement signed with La Fraternidad (LF) and the remaining  ?including the general manager ?are staff not covered by or excluded from the collective agreement? It acknowledges that it has arbitrarily and unlawfully relegated a significant percentage of the workforce ?the large majority of whom are managerial or executive staff represented by the APDFA ?to the category of not covered by the collective agreement?
.After receiving the communication stating the APDFAs position, the Ministry of Labour issued an ambiguous decision stating that it is neither appropriate nor relevant to issue a decision on the situation of the category of workers who are not covered by the collective agreement? Moreover, in addition to denying the representative capacity of the elected trade union delegates and failing to recognize the immunity afforded by the law to union representatives in the enterprise, the anti-union conduct of Ferrosur SA included refusal to provide a notice board, prohibition of assemblies at the workplace and denial of trade union leave.Allegations concerning anti-union persecution, refusal to engage in collective bargaining and prevention of unionization in the Amrica Latina Logstica Central SA and Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica SA (All) enterprises
.The modus operandi in these enterprises is virtually identical to that used by the company mentioned in the preceding paragraph to prevent the exercise of trade union rights. There is such a close resemblance that it practically confirms the assumption that the enterprises have adopted a common concerted strategy, aided by the inaction of the Ministry of Labour. Specifically, in , when elections of staff delegates were convened by the APDFA in accordance with the power vested in it by Act No.  (sections  to ), the enterprise denied the legality of the electoral process and the legitimacy of the delegates who were elected. The enterprise subsequently stepped up its anti-union acts, and on  February  the All enterprise dismissed substitute delegate Mr Ramn Daro Alcaraz, after suspending him without cause in . The procedure for lifting trade union immunity as required by ActNo. on occupational associations was not followed during his suspension and dismissal.
.The APDFA adds that, in view of the manifest illegality of the discriminatory anti-union dismissal, on  May  the Fifth Division of the National Labour Court ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed delegate. In addition, in view of the pressure and harassment to which members were being subjected, in the same year the following telegram was sent denouncing the enterprise:Your anti-union practices, contrary to freedom of association, targeting the Association of Management Staff of Argentine Railways and General Ports Administration (APDFA) and its members working in your enterprise. Such practices include constant pressure on our members to withdraw from membership or to prevent the workers we represent who have not yet joined the union from doing so. In this context, serious acts have been committed in recent years, in which you have made the appropriate and well deserved promotion (the necessary requirements having been met) of several of our members conditional on withdrawing from membership of the APDFA, in a coercive manner that is contrary to the principle of good faith that should govern individual and collective labour relations. Given that such conduct constitutes an unfair labour practice under subsections (b), (c) and (j) of section  of ActNo., as well as violating the protection guaranteed in the national Constitution (articles bis and , paragraph ) and in Conventions Nos ,  and , I warn you to cease these practices immediately, failing which complaints will be filed with the competent national and international bodies and legal proceedings will be brought to seek guarantees for the free and unrestricted exercise of freedom of association. You have been duly warned.
.The APDFA states that the All enterprise resorted to all kinds of manoeuvres to evade its duty to bargain with the union. After removing all of its managerial and executive staff from the coverage of the collective agreement in the s, when regular bargaining rounds were once more being resumed in the country, the All enterprise refused to recognize the unions representative capacity, while taking the opposite stance with regard to other trade unions of railway workers, with which it bargained without any problem. This prompted a number of instances of direct action by the APDFA aimed at breaking down employer resistance.
.The APDFA points out that Act No.  regulates the exercise of the right to strike, which is guaranteed in the national Constitution. This Act provides that once the Ministry of Labour has been informed of a conflict of interests, it may order mandatory conciliation and summon the parties to hearings with a view to reaching agreement. During the period of mandatory conciliation, the parties must restore the situation to what it was before the conflict and cease any direct action they have taken. The Act sets time limits within which the administrative authority may order mandatory conciliation ( days, which may be extended by another five days); during this period, the parties may not continue or adopt direct action measures. However, to prevent this restriction from becoming a prohibition, the Act provides that once the time limits for mandatory conciliation ?i.e. the periods during which direct action measures are suspended ?have expired, the Ministry of Labour cannot order it again for the same dispute.
.The complainant organization alleges that, notwithstanding the above, in the dispute that arose between the APDFA and the enterprise as a result of the latters refusal to bargain, the administrative authority ordered mandatory conciliation in June , after the time limit for conciliation had expired without the enterprise having rescinded its decision not to bargain, so that the parties were free to exercise the right to strike. Accordingly, the APDFA called for a new direct action measure for  October , consisting of a work stoppage and a march to the Ministry of Labour. The APDFA points out that, despite the fact that this was the same dispute, the Ministry of Labour arbitrarily and illegally ordered a new round of mandatory conciliation, the situation being further aggravated by the fact that it notified the union of this measure at the end of the day on  October, or during the night of ? October, by posting the notice on the door of the trade union premises: it stood to reason that there would not be anyone in the office to receive the notification. All of this demonstrates the illegality of the action taken by the Ministry of Labour, whose orders amount in practice to a prohibition on the exercise of the right to strike by the workers who are members of the APDFA.Allegations concerning the Ferrovas SA enterprise
.The APDFA points out that when Ferrovas SA took over the operation of the railway service on the General Belgrano Railway, this enterprise, as in the cases described above, excluded managerial and executive staff from coverage by the collective agreements and harassed its members with the evident aim of preventing the union from having a presence in the enterprise. Despite the many actions taken and the formal requests filed, the company has continued up to now to deny the right to bargain and conclude a collective labour agreement. As in the case of the other enterprises referred to in the complaint, the company threatened APDFA members with dismissal and succeeded in achieving its objective with respect to many of them. The APDFA adds that a complaint for unfair labour practice was filed in response to that measure and to a sanction that was imposed on union delegate Mr Daro Corbaln, as a result of which a complaint for unfair labour practice was lodged with the National Labour Court.
.In its communication of May , the Government states that the Executive Office of the Minister was consulted on the case, and the legal office informed it that it is clear from the records attached to its reply that the Ministry of Labours attitude has been cooperative, as it has held a number of hearings to address the concern to conclude a collective labour agreement with each of the enterprises involved. In brief, the records of the hearings suggest that the root of the problem lies in an unresolved dispute concerning representative status, with the possibility of a complaint for unfair labour practice being filed with the courts.
.As regards the complaint of persecution of union officials,",4,2010,Argentina
114,"as may be seen from the complaint itself, the relevant proceedings have been initiated before the labour court, from which the Government concludes that appropriate legal steps have been taken with regard to the protection of these officials, in accordance with national legislation.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that, although it has been granted trade union status (a status which confers certain exclusive rights such as the conclusion of collective agreements, protection of union officials, payment of trade union dues through deductions from wages by the employer, the right to undertake and manage social initiatives, etc.), several enterprises in the railway sector (referred to by name in the complaint) refuse to engage in collective bargaining and that the administrative authority has not advanced the bargaining process, notwithstanding the proceedings filed by the complainant organization. The Committee also observes that the complainant organization alleges acts of harassment and persecution of its officials and members (in the Ferrosur SA enterprise, the allegations refer to pressure on members to withdraw from the union, refusal to recognize the election of delegates and to engage in dialogue with elected delegates, refusal to provide a notice board, prohibition on holding union assemblies and denial of trade union leave; in the Amrica Latina Logstica Central and Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica enterprises, alleged denial of the legality of the trade union election procedure, refusal to recognize elected delegates and dismissal on  February  of substitute delegate Mr Ramn Daro Alcaraz whose reinstatement was ordered by the court on  May ; in the Ferrovas SA enterprise, alleged threats of dismissal against members and sanction imposed on delegate Mr Daro Corbaln).
.As regards the alleged refusal by several enterprises in the railway sector to engage in collective bargaining with the APDFA, despite the fact that it has trade union status, the Committee notes that the Government states that the attitude of the labour ministry has been cooperative and that a number of hearings have been held in order to address the concern to conclude a collective labour agreement with each of the enterprises involved, and that the records of the hearings suggest that the root of the problem lies in a dispute with regard to representative status, with the possibility of a complaint for unfair labour practice being filed with the courts. In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government attaches with its reply a copy of the record of a meeting with the APDFA and several of the enterprises in the sector, in which the parties accept the proposal of the administrative authority to hold hearings in order to address the concern to conclude a collective labour agreement, as well as records of subsequent hearings in April  indicating that an enterprise (Ferrovas SA) cites a dispute regarding representative status for bargaining purposes and another enterprise (Ferrosur SA) has set out an agenda to initiate bargaining.
.The Committee regrets that the APDFA, which has trade union status, has still not been able to conclude a collective agreement with the enterprises in the sector, despite the time that has elapsed since it expressed its desire to initiate bargaining. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to promptly take all the measures possible to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between the APDFA and the enterprises concerned with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.As regards the allegations of acts of harassment and persecution of officials and members of the APDFA (in the Ferrosur SA enterprise, alleged pressure on members to leave the union, refusal to recognize the election of delegates and to engage in dialogue with elected delegates, refusal to provide a notice board, prohibition of union assemblies and denial of trade union leave; in the Amrica Latina Logstica Central and Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica enterprises, alleged denial of the legality of the trade union election procedure, refusal to recognize elected delegates and dismissal on  February  of substitute delegate Mr Ramn Daro Alcaraz whose reinstatement was ordered by the court on  May ; in the Ferrovas SA enterprise, alleged threats of dismissal against members and sanction imposed on delegate Mr Daro Corbaln), the Committee notes that the Government states that, as mentioned by the complainant organization, the relevant proceedings have been initiated before the labour court, from which it concludes that appropriate legal steps have been taken with regard to the protection of these officials, in accordance with national legislation.
.The Committee notes that according to the complainant organization, complaints for unfair labour practices were filed with the judicial authority concerning the alleged threats of dismissal of members and the sanction imposed on delegate Mr Daro Corbaln in the Ferrovas SA enterprise. In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of these judicial proceedings. In addition, the Committee notes that the APDFA alleges that the Fifth Division of the National Labour Court ordered the reinstatement of union delegate Mr Ramn Daro Alcaraz, who had been dismissed from the All enterprise in violation of trade union immunity. The Committee requests the Government to confirm that the trade union delegate has been reinstated without loss of pay.
.As regards the remaining allegations of anti-union discrimination (pressure on members to leave the union, refusal to recognize the election of delegates and to engage in dialogue with elected delegates, refusal to provide a notice board, prohibition of trade union assemblies and denial of trade union leave in the Ferrosur SA enterprise; denial of the legality of the trade union election procedure and refusal to recognize elected delegates in the Amrica Latina Logstica Central and Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica enterprises; and threats of dismissal of members in the Ferrovas SA enterprise), the Committee regrets the considerable delay of the Government in responding and urges it to carry out an investigation and to inform it of the results.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to promptly take all the measures possible to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between the APDFA and the enterprises concerned in the sector, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings for unfair labour practices filed with regard to the alleged threats of dismissal of APDFA members and for the sanction imposed on delegate Mr Daro Corbaln in the Ferrovas SA enterprise.(c) The Committee requests the Government to confirm that trade union delegate Mr Ramn Daro Alcaraz, who had been dismissed from the All enterprise in violation of trade union immunity, has been reinstated without loss of pay in accordance with the order issued by the judicial authority.(d) The Committee regrets the considerable delay of the Government in responding and urges it to carry out an investigation into the following allegations of anti-union discrimination: () pressure on members to leave the union; refusal to recognize the election of delegates and to engage in dialogue with elected delegates; refusal to provide a notice board; prohibition of trade union assemblies and denial of trade union leave in the Ferrosur SA enterprise; () denial of the legality of the trade union election procedure and refusal to recognize elected delegates in the Amrica Latina Logstica Central and Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica enterprises; and () threats of dismissal of members in the Ferrovas SA enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of the investigation.",-1,2010,Argentina
115,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see rd Report, para.], when it made the following recommendation:Regretting that the proceedings (both administrative and judicial) concerning the application by the Association of Banks?Senior Staff Officers (APJBO) for trade union status have been under way for more than eight years (according to the complainant, the application was filed in March ), the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation concerning the appeal filed by the complainant organization, as soon as it is issued.
.In its communications of  August  and March , the Government stated that: ()the case known as Ministry of Labour v. Association of Banks?Senior Staff Officers concerning the Trade Union Associations Act is still before the Third Chamber of the National Labour Appeals Tribunal; () it should be noted that the final judgement of November , which was handed down by the aforementioned judicial authority, was overturned by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation as a result of the extraordinary federal appeal filed by the complainant organization; () on  April , the proceedings were returned to the Third Chamber of the National Labour Appeals Tribunal in order for a new judgment to be handed down; () on  August , the Third Chamber rejected the extraordinary federal appeal filed by the APJBO; and () the Government consulted the Supreme Court of Justice which indicated that no appeal had been registered to date. The Committee takes note of this information.
.The Committee last examined this case at its May  meeting [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, paras ?].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee hopes that the judicial authority will shortly pronounce its judgment in the appeal filed by the APJBO against the administrative decisions which refused trade union representative status and, for the purposes of pronouncing on the substance of the case, requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgment as soon as it is issued.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government reports that the case (Ministry of Labour v. Association of Banks?Senior Staff Officers concerning the Trade Union Associations Act) is currently before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation. The case was examined by the Third Chamber of the National Labour Appeals Tribunal, which handed down Final Judgment No.  dated  November  (the National Labour Appeals Tribunal dismissed the appeal filed by the complainant organization).
.The Government adds that the complainant organization filed an extraordinary federal appeal against this judgment. This appeal was granted on  May  and the case was brought before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation on  May .
.The Committee recalls that, in the present case, the complainant organization (which states that it has , members) challenged the decision of the administrative authority to refuse its application for trade union representative status (a status which confers certain exclusive rights such as the conclusion of collective agreements, special protection of union officials, payment of trade union dues through deductions from wages by the employer, and so on), (application of  March ) in the Bank of the Argentine Nation, in order to be able to bargain collectively.
.At its May  meeting, the Committee regretted the long period of time that had passed (over five years) since the complainant organization had requested trade union representative status and emphasized the importance of reaching decisions in such matters within a reasonable length of time. With regard to the substance of the question, to grant or not to grant the trade union representative status to the complainant organization (which requires a comparison of the representativeness of the trade unions existing in the Bank), given that the procedure for determining the representativeness of the trade union concerned via the comparison of its relevant affiliates had not been completed, the Committee indicated that it would examine the substance of the question when it has the judgment issued by the National Labour Appeals Tribunal where the appeal filed by the complainant organization is being heard.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () the National Labour Appeals Tribunal dismissed the appeal filed by the complainant organization against Decision No. / by the administrative authority, which rejected the application for trade union status; and () the complainant organization appealed against this decision in an extraordinary federal appeal, which was granted on  May , and as a result the case was brought before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation.
.Under these circumstances, regretting that the proceedings (both administrative and judicial) concerning the application by the APJBO for trade union status have been under way for more than eight years (according to the complainant, the application was filed in March ), the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation concerning the appeal filed by the complainant organization, as soon as it is issued.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Regretting that the proceedings (both administrative and judicial) concerning the application by the Association of Banks?Senior Staff Officers (APJBO) for trade union status have been under way for more than eight years (according to the complainant, the application was filed in March ), the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation concerning the appeal filed by the complainant organization, as soon as it is issued.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the Association of Banks?Senior Staff Officers (APJBO) dated July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of July , the APJBO states that it is a first-level entity with trade union registration granted by resolution No.  of  April , registered number . It covers the whole country and its membership consists of all managerial staff in national official banks, their successors or organizations which replace them or provide equivalent services, irrespective of their legal form, in the administrative, professional, technical and specialist branches, equipment and services from deputy head of division, head of area or general manager and/or equivalent in the various branches, in post or who on retirement were members of the organization. The complainant organization adds that it is a trade union with nationwide coverage in Argentina which seeks trade union representative status (to be able to engage in collective bargaining) in the Bank of the Argentine Nation.
.It indicates that this bank is the biggest in the country and its trade union is the Banking Association, whose representative status covers all workers in that activity. This association has a monopoly of collective bargaining. Thus the APJBO does not have even the possibility of having a joint member in the bargaining body. The APJBO has ,paying members, it is affiliated to the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) and has carried on a variety of trade union activities since its foundation. It has been most active in the Bank of the Argentine Nation. All its members are workers in that institution, although the trade union registration?covers all official banks (meaning those owned by the State at national, provincial or municipal level).
.The complainant organization states that in order to obtain the maximum recognition allowed under Argentine law, and thus to have full legal capacity as a trade union, the application for representative status as a trade union was begun on  March . By an order dated  August , it was held that the registration requirements set out in article(a) of Act No.  had been fulfilled and the trade union was thereby duly registered. In the framework of the application, it was stated that ?the precise context in which it is sought to obtain trade union representative status is the Bank of the Argentine Nation? By an order of  September , the APJBO was required to specify the differentiated trade union interests which justified specific representation of the segment of workers which it claimed to represent.
.On  September , a further order was made to send an official letter to the Bank of the Argentine Nation requesting it to inform the relevant authority (the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security ?MTEySS) of the number of managerial staff employed by the bank in the six-month period prior to the application. It",2,2010,Argentina
116,"was also sent to the Banking Association, which requested that the APJBOs application should be refused at the outset.
.By an order of  July  of the MTEySS, it was suggested that the requirement should be deemed to be fulfilled and a verification hearing under article  of the Trade Unions Act (LAS) was fixed, in order to ascertain the number of paying members of the organization in the claimed context. This process was completed on  March . Considering the delay and the constant prevarications of the administration, on  April , an action for amparo for administrative delay was filed in the National Labour Court of First Instance No. . On  June , the court issued a judgment in the case, No./, Banks?Senior Staff Officers v. Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, amparo, which expressly ordered that pursuant to article  of Act No., the National Executive Power, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, is required within ten days to inform the court of the reasons for the delay alleged in the complaint, a copy to be attached in relation to administrative proceeding No./, failing which, the findings in the case will be determined on the evidence before the court?
.The complainant organization states that on  June, resolution No. / was issued, refusing the application for trade union representative status. The grounds indicate that the application would mean that the exercise of trade union representation would alter the classification adopted by the trade union, overstepping the bounds of the classifications defined by law and the will of the general meeting to be constituted as a category trade union determined by this authority as applying at the time when it obtained trade union registration? It also alludes to the provisions of articles  and  of the Trade Unions Act but, in justifying the refusal, relies only on article  and the related articles of the Act.
.The complainant organization adds that the restrictions imposed by Act No.  on the granting of representative status to trade unions for an office, category, profession or company had led the ILO Committee of Experts to observe that they were incompatible with Articles  and  of Convention No. . The complainants state that the ILO supervisory bodies had, for many years, been making observations concerning Argentine law with respect to certain restrictions on some types of trade union, such as those for a company, office, profession and category. The CEACR has commented on many occasions on the incompatibility of articles  and  of Act No.  with Article of Convention No. . The objections of the ILO Committee of Experts highlight the obstacles which bar access to trade union representative status to trade unions of workers in a single company and workers in a same office, profession or category (articles  and  of the Act). The complainant organization recalls that article  of Act No.  allows the granting of trade union representative status to a trade union of workers in a single company only exceptionally, on the grounds of the lack of another union which has that status in both geographical terms and the activity or category. For its part, article  prevents recognition as most representative?to a trade union representing an office, profession or category?when there is a pre-existing activity trade union?which has that status. By that last condition alone, which it is impossible to fulfil in practice, any possibility of workers grouped according to their office effectively exercising collective defence of their rights and interest is rendered merely theoretical. Article  adds a second requirement, which is devoid of any objectivity: the clause which requires the existence of differentiated trade union interests to justify specific representation?
.The complainant organization indicates that the impossibility of exercising collective representation is yet one more of the rights denied to organizations which are merely registered. This case is one of many which show that the Government has made no effort with regard to the urgent requests of the ILO supervisory bodies. In this regard, all have pronounced in the same vein over all the issues raised, namely, amendment of the Trade Union Act, applications for trade union representative status and observations on the social situation. The Argentine Government has not made any comments concerning any of these. The complainant organization alleges that the Government drags out the proceedings which it knows will go against it in the courts, following the precedent of the ATE?and Rossi?cases in the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, which were the subject of comments by the CEACR in its last report in . This case is evidence of this modus operandi: the prevarication method. Although it could have refused the application immediately on its submission giving the same reasons, it preferred to wait almost six years to refuse representative status and, as indicated above, then made it necessary to take legal action to force the administration to resolve the matter (amparo for administrative delay).
.The complainant organization indicates that a special appeal was filed against the decision which refused trade union representative status in the National Labour Appeals Tribunal. As the proceedings justifying the highest number of paying members of the complainant organization have not been completed (article  of Act No. ), the Tribunal can only decide to continue the proceedings, but cannot make a ruling, even if the application for trade union representative status is decided favourably.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that the Department of Legal Affairs of the MTEySS was consulted about the alleged refusal of the application for trade union representative status. The Department gave the following indications: () case No./ began with the application for trade union representative status submitted by the Association of Banks?Senior Staff Officers, a first-level trade union registered No. ; () by decision of the MTEySS No.  of  June  (the Government attached a copy of the decision to its reply) it was decided to refuse the application submitted by the trade union concerned, based on the jurisprudence of the Attorney General and the provisions of articles and  of Act No. ; () the trade union appealed directly against this decision pursuant to article  of Act No. , requesting that articles  and  of the Act should be declared unconstitutional; () the appeal was registered at the National Labour Appeals Tribunal on  August , and the case was heard in Court III of the Tribunal (case No. /); and () on  October , notice of the proceedings was served on the prosecutors office. The Government indicates that it considers it appropriate to await the corresponding judicial decision.
.The Committee observes that in this case, the complainant organization (which states that it has , members) is challenging the decision of the administrative authority to refuse its application for trade union representative status (application of  March ) in the Bank of the Argentine Nation, in order to be able to bargain collectively.
.The Committee notes that the Government states that: () the Ministry of Labour and Employment refused the application for trade union representative status submitted by the complainant organization on  June , based on the jurisprudence of the Attorney Generals Office and the provisions of articles  and  of the Trade Unions Act No. of  (the Government sent a copy of the decision which is reproduced as an annex); () the complainant organization appealed, seeking a judgment that articles and  of Act No.  should be declared unconstitutional; () the appeal was registered at the National Labour Appeals Tribunal on  August , and on October , notice of the proceedings was served on the prosecutors office; and () it considers it appropriate to await the corresponding judicial decision.
.Firstly, the Committee regrets the long period of time that has passed (over five years) since the complainant organization requested trade union representative status (a status which grants exclusive rights, such as concluding collective agreements) and emphasizes the importance of reaching decisions in such matters within a reasonable length of time. With regard to the substance of the question, to grant or not to grant the trade union representative status to the complainant organization (which requires a comparison of the representativeness of the trade unions existing in the Bank), given that the procedure for determining the representativeness of the trade union concerned via the comparison of its relevant affiliates had not yet been completed, the Committee will examine the substance of the question when it has the judicial decision issued by the National Labour Appeals Tribunal where the appeal filed by the complainant organization is being heard. In these circumstances, the Committee hopes that the judicial authority will shortly pronounce its judgment and requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgment as soon as it is issued.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee hopes that the",2,2010,Argentina
117,"judicial authority will shortly pronounce its judgment in the appeal filed by the APJBO against the administrative decisions which refused trade union representative status and, for the purposes of pronouncing on the substance of the case, requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgment as soon as it is issued.",2,2010,Argentina
118,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of Judicial Employees of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (AEPJCABA) and the Argentine Judicial Federation (FJA) on  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication in May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the AEPJCABA and the FJA state that they have submitted the present complaint against the Government of Argentina owing to the unusual delay in granting the trade union status requested by the AEPJCABA, detailed in administrative Case No.../. The facts point to a failure to recognize the trade union or, worse still, to uphold the principles of freedom of association. The complainant organizations request the Committee to urge the Government of Argentina to grant trade union status and trade union rights to the abovementioned organization, thus putting an immediate end to the flagrant violations of freedom of association.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the association in question is a first-level trade union entity, with trade union registration granted by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security by means of Decision No. /, registration number .The information in Case No. ../ indicates that the trade union association was the most representative, in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Act on Trade Union Associations, with a view to the granting of trade union status in the following segment of the sector: dependent workers in a permanent or temporary employment relationship, employed as administrative and maintenance staff, deputy clerks of court, deputy clerks dealing with administrative matters and heads of division by the judiciary of the autonomous city of Buenos Aires, within the zone covered by that city? A comparison process was launched, to determine which union was more representative, with the assessment period running from December  to May , in line with the provisions of Act No. .
.The complainants indicate that, in December , the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations (DNAS) established ?in a lengthy and well-founded statement ?that the trade union had met all the requirements laid down in Act No. , approved the request for trade union status from the AEPJCABA and transmitted the draft decision to the Secretariat of Labour of the Ministry. This document expressly stated that the applicant had provided proof of the number of paying members, exceeding the percentage stipulated in article  of Act No. and, as there were no entities with trade union status, with a proven number of paying members, already in existence in the same category of persons and geographical area covered by the application, the advice was to accept the application, granting the applicant trade union status? This statement was supported by the Head of the Trade Union Structure Department of the DNAS, the Deputy Director of the DNAS and the Director of the DNAS. On  February , the case file was referred to the Secretariat of Labour, together with the draft decision, which was then read and signed by the Deputy Minister. On  March , the Deputy Minister of Labour sent the case file and draft decision for the consideration of the Minister of Labour. The case file was returned to the DNAS on  April . On  July , the legal service of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security stated that it was necessary to determine which was the most representative trade union entity, comparing the membership of the abovementioned association and the Union of Employees of the National Judiciary (UEJN), as both trade union associations were competing to represent a similar segment of the sector, in order to ensure that trade union status was granted to the most representative union.
.The complainants state that both the AEPJCABA and the UEJN were merely registered entities in the segment of the sector in dispute. In this specific case, both associations had launched their application for trade union status in parallel (the AEPJCABA had been the first to do so) and, as there was no other association with trade union status already in existence, trade union status could be granted to either trade union entity, as existing legislation did not provide for a specific solution in this situation. The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was of the opinion that it was necessary to set the same time frame to compare the two associations, in order to establish which was the most representative. Both associations agreed to proceed in this manner. The DNAS also supported that decision and summoned the complainant association and the UEJN to a hearing to assess their representativeness, on  October . The hearing proceeded according to plan. Once again, the AEPJCABA demonstrated that it was the more representative trade union association in the segment of the sector in which it wished to hold trade union status. However, the UEJN did not attend the hearing, delaying the process on the grounds that it had lodged an appeal for reconsideration and hierarchical re-examination against the decision to call the hearing.
.The administrative appeal was rejected, and the DNAS set a new hearing date to give the UEJN the opportunity to provide proof of the membership it claimed to have. On November , a hearing was held to establish the UEJNs representativeness on the basis of its membership register, also attended by the AEPJCABA in order to exercise its right to control. In Case No. ---, the AEPJCABA contested the hearing and the examination of documents, the UEJN having failed to respond to the notice served to exercise its right to defence. Subsequently, on  April , and in order to obtain further knowledge of the facts, an official request was sent to the Council of the Magistrature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires to request information on the number of dependent workers employed as administrative and maintenance staff, deputy clerks of court, deputy clerks dealing with administrative matters and heads of division working for the Judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires who were members of the AEPJCABA and members of the UEJN, with the same status, during the period December  to May  (inclusive), broken down by month.
.On  May , the UEJN lodged an appeal for reconsideration and hierarchical reexamination of the official request of  April , stating that this request was unjust and irrelevant. On  May , the DNAS decided to reject the appeal for reconsideration lodged by the UEJN on the grounds that the official request for further clarification was a preparatory, and therefore unappealable, measure (article  of the Regulatory Decree issued by LNPA). The UEJN was informed of this decision on  May , without it having expanded on the grounds for its pending appeal for hierarchical re-examination. In turn, the Council of the Magistrature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires responded to the request for data, broken down by month, as follows:Month / Members of the UEJN / Members of the AEPJCABADecember  /  / January  /  / February  /  / March  /  / April  /  / 
.The AEPJCABA had been registered, in line with the provisions of Act No. , by means of Decision No. / issued by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and had been active for more than six months (a requirement set out in subparagraph (a) of article ). Moreover, the AEPJCABAs membership constituted more than  per cent of the workers it sought to represent. This fact emerged from the various reports supplied by the employer (the Council of the Magistrature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires), the most recent of which was collated in the form of Case No.../. The latter demonstrated that the AEPJCABA had a larger average number of paid-up trade union members than the UEJN, and this figure constituted more than per cent of the average number of workers it sought to represent. These average figures were calculated over the six-month period immediately preceding the date on which the application was submitted, namely from December  to May  (a requirement stipulated in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of article ).
.In this case, the segments of the sector under dispute overlapped with those covered by the Association of State Workers (ATE) and the National Civil Servants?Union (UPCN). The ATE stated its position on the historical coexistence of trade unions in the public sector, while the UPCN expressed its opposition. However, these bodies then failed to attend the relevant hearings to assess representativeness, or to provide evidence of the number of paying members they had in the segment of the sector in dispute, as required under article of Act No. . In this regard, it should be borne in mind that Decision No./ of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which is currently in force, states that the",0,2010,Argentina
119,"granting of trade union status to representative trade union associations in the public sector does not, for the abovementioned segment of the sector, displace any other entities with trade union status already in existence, which continue to enjoy the rights laid down in articles ,  et seq. of Act No. .
.The complainant organizations state that, in the light of this evidence, they fail to understand the unwillingness of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security to grant the AEPJCABA the right to trade union status, and with it all the rights and guarantees derived from those statutes, such as: the protection of the courts for trade union representatives; the right to elect delegates; to engage in collective bargaining; to defend and represent vis--vis the State and the employers ?the individual and collective interests of the workers; the right to participate in the work of supervisory and planning bodies; in line with the relevant legislation; to intervene in collective bargaining and monitor compliance with labour and social security legislation; to collaborate with the State in investigating and resolving workers?problems; to create patrimonies of affectation with the same rights as cooperatives and mutual aid societies; to manage its own social programmes; and, if required, be involved in the management of those set up by law or through collective bargaining agreements.
.According to the complainants, the information in administrative Case No. .. indicates that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security has remained silent in the face of repeated requests from the AEPJCABA to be granted trade union status. On  May , the AEPJCABA requested for the matter to be settled quickly, in line with the provisions of article  of Act No. . Given that a special time frame of working days applied in this case, in line with the provisions of article  of Act No., in order to enable the administrative authorities to issue a decision granting trade union status once all the formal requirements had been met, the authorities?tacit refusal (denegatoria tcita) was noted on  September . Given the arbitrary refusal by the relevant authority to grant the AEPJCABA trade union status, despite the fact that the association had met all the legal requirements, there was no other option available other than to lodge a complaint against this arbitrary treatment before the Committee on Freedom of Association. Under Argentine law, the refusal to grant trade union status places real restrictions on the ability to exercise trade union rights, especially with regard to collective bargaining.
.According to the complainants, the unlawful nature of the action taken by the relevant authority is demonstrated in the fact that it constitutes a blatant breach of the specific and operational provisions of Act No.  and the corresponding Decree No. /, the National Constitution, international treaties on fundamental rights of equal standing (article(), paragraph , of the National Constitution) and ILO Conventions, in line with the jurisprudence of the National Supreme Court of Justice. The AEPJCABA has completed all the procedures required under Act No.  and fulfilled all the requirements stipulated therein. Nevertheless, trade union status has not been granted, denying the association trade union rights on arbitrary grounds, and resulting in serious and real disadvantages. Therefore, this unlawful behaviour on the part of the relevant authorities must be remedied immediately.
.The complainants indicate that any application for trade union status is judged on the basis of past cases dealt with by the Ministry of Labour, whereby a first-level trade union entity seeking trade union status must have been active for at least six months as an entity which is merely registered, and it must be the most representative association in the category of workers and geographical area in which it operates. The Deputy Labour Minister aptly described the situation, when he stated before the Committee on the Application of Standards, during the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, on  June , that: The previous trend had been accelerated by the development of an administrative policy which used the comparison mechanism for representation established in article  of Act No. , which was only brought into action to check that there was no imbalance between the personal and territorial limits of the registered association requesting union status and those of the association which already had union status.?The request for trade union status submitted by the AEPJCABA, is in accordance with the provisions of the Act on Trade Union Associations. Article  of that Act stipulates that two conditions must be met in order for trade union status to be granted, namely: (a) the entity is registered and has been active for a period no shorter than six months; and (b) its membership represents more than  per cent of the workers it seeks to represent. As all of these requirements were met during the course of the application process, the complainants are of the opinion that the administrative authorities are delaying the final decision to grant or refuse trade union status. The Labour Ministry must take action to decide, once and for all, which position to adopt. It cannot maintain its current state of silence or deploy delaying tactics in the face of requests to settle the matter quickly, or an imminent appeal for the protection of constitutional rights (amparo) on the grounds of administrative delays. Prevarication on the part of the Labour Ministry, which has failed to resolve the issue, is preventing an appeal to the courts to resolve the matter once and for all. Indeed, article  of Act No.  provides that the refusal of trade union status can be appealed directly before the National Labour Court of Appeal. However, the failure of the administrative authorities to issue a definitive decision is also blocking access to this remedy.
.In its communication of May , the Government indicates that having requested the relevant report from the Department of Legal Affairs of the Ministry, the following response was received:?administrative Case No. ../ was opened following a request for trade union status lodged by the AEPJCABA;?the DNAS referred the case file to the legal services, informing them that, in administrative Case No. ./, the UEJN had requested an extension of its trade union status to cover workers providing services for the judicial authorities and/or those directly employed as dependent workers by the public and defence services, the Council of the Magistrature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires or bodies belonging to the justice services in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Given the fact that two entities which were merely registered had submitted applications for trade union status covering the same category of workers and geographical area, a review would be required, in order to establish what course of action was necessary;?in Decision No. , dated  July , the Directorate-General of Legal Affairs indicated that it was necessary to compare the representativeness of the two trade union associations, in order to determine which was the more representative, in accordance with the guidelines in articles  and  of Act No.  on trade union associations, and that this was a reasonable solution, in line with the intended spirit of the legislative text. It was proposed that a single date should be set for the end of the assessment period, namely  May ;?the case file contains records of hearings to determine representativeness, held on September and  November . The AEPJCABA filed a complaint, in the form of administrative Case No. ../, regarding the records relating to the hearing on November;?on  April , the DNAS, in order to obtain further knowledge of the case, sent an official request to the Council of the Magistrature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires for information on the number of dependent workers employed as administrative staff and heads of division by the Judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, who were affiliated to the AEPJCABA and the UEJN, during the period under examination (December May ), broken down by month;?in administrative Case No. ../, the UEJN appealed for the reconsideration and hierarchical re-examination of the actions of the DNAS on  April , on the grounds that the employer had been involved in an issue which should have been resolved between the two trade union entities, and stressing the fact that a complaint had been lodged against that body (the Council of the Magistrature) for unfair practices. The case is currently before the National Labour Court (No. );?on  May , the DNAS rejected the appeal for reconsideration, referring the appeal for hierarchical re-examination to a higher instance; administrative Case No.../ contains the reply of the local Council of the Magistrature;?on  December , the Directorate-General of Legal Affairs referred the case files to the Office of the Minister as that entity was handling Case No. ../, which deals with the application submitted by the UEJN for the extension of its trade union status;?finally, in Case No. ../, the AEPJCABA indicated procedural issues which violated their rights, and requested",4,2010,Argentina
120,"that the matter be settled quickly.
.The Government states that the process has been wholly in line with legislation, involving only understandable delays relating to normal legal proceedings, under Act No. , with regard to the comparison required when two entities which are merely registered apply for trade union status covering the same category of persons and geographic area, a matter which had already been the subject of a legal proceedings involving the Council of the Magistrature. The Government indicates that, without prejudice to the information provided, it is fully committed to submitting to the ILO the follow-up of the entitys application for trade union status.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege that, despite the fact that the AEPJCABA is the most representative union in the sector, according to data provided by the Council of the Magistrature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, and which have never been questioned, the administrative authorities have not granted its request for trade union status, submitted in , thereby preventing the trade union from appealing to the courts or enjoying the various legal benefits derived from recognized trade union status as the most representative trade union (including the right to engage in collective bargaining and manage its own social programmes, and the protection of the courts for trade union representatives).
.The Committee notes that the Government states that: () the AEPJCABA submitted an application for trade union status and the UEJN requested an extension of its trade union status and, given the existence of two bodies simultaneously requesting trade union status, covering the same staff and area, it was necessary to determine the action to be taken; ()the Department of Legal Affairs stated that it was necessary to compare the representativeness of the two trade union associations in order to establish which was the more representative, in line with the provisions of the Act on Trade Union Associations, and suggested setting the date for the end of the assessment period as  May ; ()hearings were held on  September and  November  to determine representativeness, and the AEPJCABA contested the records relating to the meeting of November ; () on  April , the DNAS requested the Council of the Magistrature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, to provide information on the number of dependent workers employed in administrative tasks or as heads of division by the judicial authorities of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires who were members of the AEPJCABA and the UEJN during the period under examination (December May, broken down by month); () the UEJN filed an appeal for reconsideration of the action taken by the DNAS on  April , as it was of the opinion that it had involved the employer in a matter which must be resolved between the two entities, and announced that it had lodged a complaint alleging unfair practices against the Council of the Magistrature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; () the DNAS rejected the appeal filed by the UEJN and the Directorate of Legal Affairs referred the case, on December, to the Ministers Office, as that body was already dealing with the application for the extension of trade union status submitted by the UEJN; () the AEPJCABA drew up a statement indicating the procedural issues which infringed its rights and requested that the matter be settled quickly; and () the procedure had involved no unlawful measures, only understandable delays relating to normal legal proceedings, under Act No. , and the assessment process required in cases where two registered trade union organizations applied for trade union status covering the same segment of the sector and category of staff.
.In this regard, noting that the complainant organization has repeatedly requested, through appropriate legal channels, the granting of trade union status, without any success, the Committee regrets the long period of time which has lapsed (almost five years) without a definite ruling by the administrative authorities on the AEPJCABAs application for trade union status, a situation which has certainly placed the trade union at a disadvantage, as it has been unable to exercise, among others, the right to collective bargaining. Under these circumstances, and bearing in mind that the authorities possess information on the comparison of representativeness, as submitted by the Council of the Magistrature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (informing the Government that the AEPJCABA was the more representative trade union), the Committee urges the Government to take a decision without delay regarding the AEPJCABAs application for trade union status.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee strongly urges the Government to take a decision without delay regarding the AEPJCABAs application for trade union status.",-1,2010,Argentina
121,".The Committee last examined this case, the pending allegations for which concerned a criminal complaint for contempt of court in relation to the compulsory conciliation order against trade union officials, at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras  and]. On that occasion, having recalled the principle that no one should be deprived of their freedom or be subject to penal sanctions for the mere fact of organizing or participating in a peaceful strike and in accordance with freedom of association principles, the Committee noted that the case was at the investigation stage and requested the Government to keep it informed of any final ruling handed down in relation to this case.
.As part of the follow-up to the case, in a communication of  April , the Government states that on  June  a decision was taken to shelve the proceedings in progress for alleged contempt of court against the trade union officials in question (the Government attaches a copy of the corresponding court decision).
.Having duly noted that the proceedings against the leaders of the complainant organization for the alleged offence of contempt of court were shelved, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see nd Report, para. ], when it made the following recommendation:The Committee recalls that no one should be deprived of their freedom or be subject to penal sanctions for the mere fact of organizing or participating in a peaceful strike and requests the Government to provide a copy of the final judgment relating to the criminal proceedings for contempt of court in relation to the compulsory conciliation order against trade union officials of the AGMER named in the complaint.
.In its communication of  July , the Government sent the legal opinion of the Provincial Labour Directorate of the province of Entre Ros indicating that the criminal case in question (Elizar Sergio, Madoz Marta, Budino Luis Csar, Snchez Zulma, Snchez Norma and Rodrguez Patricia for contempt of court? was brought before Magistrates Court No.  of the city of Paran. The provincial authority adds that according to information from the court no ruling has yet been handed down and the case is at the investigation stage. The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of any final ruling handed down in relation to this case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Teachers?Association of Entre Ros (AGMER) dated  June . The Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) supported the complaint.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the AGMER states that it is an entity with legal recognition granted by Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MTYSSN) Resolution No. dated  June  and that it is registered under No.  as a firstlevel trade union entity, covering the territory of the province of Entre Ros, Republic of Argentina. It also states that it is affiliated to the CTERA, which is a second-level trade union entity (federation), covering the whole territory of the Republic of Argentina.
.AGMER indicates that the Government has ratified Convention No.  and Conventions Nos  and . It adds that article bis of the National Constitution of Argentina guarantees trade unions, as a fundamental right, the right to strike and that the second paragraph of article () of the National Constitution, for its part, grants constitutional character to a series of international treaties on human rights, including the New York Covenants of , under which Conventions Nos ,  and  are recognized as having the same rank. The Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights further establishes, specifically, that States parties undertake to guarantee the right to strike (article.(d)). This circle of protection of freedom of association is closed by the first paragraph of article () of the National Constitution, which grants it supra-legal status with respect to other international treaties, including the ILO Conventions.
.The National Constitution also establishes the representative, republican and federal system and, finally, each Provincial State has legislative powers and, with reference to collective bargaining in the public administration, the convocation procedure must necessarily be included in the legislation of each province. The complainant organization adds that the Constitution of the province of Entre Ros recognizes The rights, declarations and guarantees set out in the National Constitution, which that said Constitution deems to be reproduced, shall not be understood as negating other rights and guarantees not listed therein but which derive from the principle of sovereignty of the people, the republican form of government and humankind as such ?(article ). Thus, the rights contained in the National Constitution are incorporated and respected in the provincial framework and these include freedom of association and the right to organize, collective agreements, the right to strike and guarantees of the trade union status of trade union representatives.
.In this regard, the province of Entre Ros has amended its Constitution. These amendments came into force in November  and, among other guarantees, approved the provision in article  that: Work is a right which the State shall protect and promote.?In particular, the same instrument establishes: (a) collective bargaining which guarantees the principle of inalienability, progressiveness, primacy of reality, indemnity and, in case of doubt, interpretation in favour of the worker; and (b) the general regulatory framework of the provincial and municipal public employee, with the participation of the workers, shall ensure compliance with regulations on health, safety and prevention of accidents ? The complainant organization considers that although the legal framework and the rights of all those who work as employees of the State in the province of Entre Ros are clearly defined, in the particular case of the teachers, as will be seen, these rights and guarantees have been clearly and repeatedly infringed.
.The complainant organization indicates that in , direct industrial action measures were approved and implemented by decision of the AGMER and the other teachers?representative trade unions, based on the pursuit of a legitimate wage reform, among other labour claims which have been ongoing for several years. These measures, which were legal and in compliance with the trade union statutes, were voluntarily and massively supported by Entre Ros teachers, who refused to perform tasks, in the exercise of the direct constitutional right to strike enshrined in article bis of the National Constitution and other relevant legislations.
.These measures were clearly claims-related and sought to secure the constitutional guarantee of fair remuneration?for all workers represented by the trade unions in the sector. Despite the fact that these trade union actions were legitimate means of trade union action?(enshrined in Act No. ), the Government of the province of Entre Ros and the General Education Council issued a constant, monthly and regular series of regulations which attacked the right to strike with the purpose of: () making deductions from the wages of those who exercised that right; () taking action against head teachers who did not hand over?the list of teachers taking part in the strike, in order to make the deductions; and () making a note in the personal file of each of the sanctioned teachers.
.The complainant organization indicates that the many meetings held between teaching unions, the educational and financial authorities of the province and the Governor himself were public meetings aimed at achieving a reform of remuneration to place teachers in a position to perform their work in decent conditions. All these negotiations plainly and clearly failed because the meetings were held without any offer of a genuine reform of wages or measures to ensure decent and safe conditions of work. In the face of the collapse of the negotiations, direct industrial action measures were mandated by teachers?assemblies acting in accordance with express statutory, legal and constitutional provisions.
.According to the complainant organization, the reality is that, the respect?of the public authorities for the right to strike is merely empty words, mere declarations without substance in government practice. On the contrary, State legislation issued at the same time has the quite opposite effect, since the implementation of wage deductions for strike days has a real and substantial impact on teachers?wages. This is a sanction of a pecuniary character, which is totally illegal, since the industrial action measures were adopted with the utmost legality and there was no declaration of illegality of those measures. This conduct is unacceptable and incompatible with a democratic State and the rule of law, since by a series of actions, such as the public warnings by the State Prosecutor that the teachers would be liable to disciplinary proceedings and dismissal, it was sought to neutralize the right to strike by instilling fear of disciplinary proceedings and consequent sanctions among those who",2,2010,Argentina
122,"exercised that right.
.The complainant organization considers that the conduct displayed in official circles was illegal and intimidating, because it subjugated the right to strike, without requesting or declaring the illegality of those actions and without, as required by article  of Act No., warning the teachers to return to their normal work. Faced with the exhaustion of the negotiations to resolve the dispute and faced with the immovable, unreasonable and recalcitrant attitude adopted by the State of the Province of Entre Ros with regard to fulfilling its obligations, the industrial action decided by the trade unions took place.
.The complainant organization states that in the face of this industrial action, which obviously had massive support from the teachers, the provincial authorities?only reply was to issue regulations to allow deductions for strike days. By doing so, they attacked the teaching profession in the province with provisions which clearly conflicted with the constitutional guarantee. This being the case, the deduction ordered by the State, apart from a dogmatic assertion lacking in any justification, constitutes penalization?in violation of a right which should be strongly guaranteed. The complainant indicates that, for that reason, it is addressing this complaint to the Committee, on constitutional and supranational grounds, concerning the statement in the preamble of the resolution of the General Education Council that If it is not performed (it refers to performance of work), remuneration should not be paid for the time when the services ceased to be provided and in proportion to the length of time when the labour was withdrawn.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The complainant organization considers that penalization for individual participation in the industrial action which was collectively decided is illegal, as the background and justification of the trade union action is the prior failure of the provincial state to comply with the constitutional requirement to revise wages in line with the cost of living, set out in the Constitution of  and in the current revised text. It should be emphasized that the principle of legality must preside over all acts of government and constitute the basic guarantee for the foundation of a democratic state and rule of law. The deductions made are an administrative sanction and, thus, an expression of the States power of sanction and punishment, which affects the right to strike, and thus has clear constitutional implications.
.The complainant organization indicates that there is a procedure in Argentina instituted by a current National Law (Act No. ) to resolve collective disputes which cannot be resolved between the parties, and this procedure was not followed by the provincial administration, which makes its action illegal. The Provincial State commits, as a matter of practice?an act which consists of making deductions from wages for days when teachers took strike action, without ensuring due process and without resorting to the appropriate bodies to determine the reasons behind the industrial action.
.The complainant organization states that bad industrial practice by the Entre Ros provincial state and the General Education Council is common. They have repeatedly abused of collective bargaining (Act No.  on Collective Bargaining for Teachers) seeking only to stop the strike action. According to the complainant, this is shown by the fact that they come to the table without genuine wage offers and, when rare and inadequate wage rises are granted, they are not consolidated as pensionable or the basis for future increases, and have no impact on teachers?benefits (concealed sums which merely diminish teaching wages, made up of various concealed items which are not subject to tax or contributions). Neither did they respond to claims for decent conditions of work, which is shown by the calamitous state of school buildings, and the lack of rooms for school canteens and washrooms.
.The administrative action in this case was illegal because it not only proceeded without respecting the right to defence or due process, but when it issued Resolution No.  on the deductions, the State had not requested compulsory conciliation through the General Education Council, nor had the trade unions been given legal notice to cease their industrial action. Thus, the administrative acts which are claimed to serve as the legal basis for the deductions are null and void because they are unjustified and lack foundation. According to the complainant, the deduction is compulsive, arbitrary, and unreasonable, and is shown in pay statement as Deduction for days not worked? without there having been a prior declaration of the illegality of the declared strike, without ordering compulsory conciliation and without giving notice to the trade unions to cease their industrial action. In short, without waiting for the judicial pronouncement and subjugating the guarantees of the teachers, who were victims of the illegal act. Not only this, but the deduction was applied as an administrative sanction?without any basis in any constitutional rule of the administrative power. The second part of article  of National ActNo. , which institutes an administrative proceeding prior to any action, is conclusive when it states: the strike or voluntary and premeditated reduction in production, below normal limits, shall result for workers in the loss of the entitlement to remuneration for the period of the strike or reduction in work if they do not cease after receiving notice from the competent authority?
.The complainant organization emphasizes that the notice to the striking workers to return to their work is the means of excluding the guarantee of the right to strike. If the judicial or administrative authority does not give this notice, it is not possible to enforce a sanction such as deduction of pay, as in that case, the administrative action violates the principle of reasonableness and fundamentally violates the principle of the hierarchy of law in article of the National Constitution. The complainant also considers that both the Provincial Government and the General Education Council violated their own rules, as they resorted to the courts to stop the strike and, before the court decision, issued administrative rulings under which they claim to legitimize the arbitrary deductions. The lack of a legal provision which legitimizes the deductions for strike days emerges clearly from the very text of Directive No.  of  of the Executive Power of the Province, an administrative act of lower rank which can in no way justify the states action. Indeed, the purpose of that act is to issue instructions on deductions of pay for the adoption of industrial action by employees of the provincial public administration? without these instructions?being in any way supported by a basic legal instrument. For that reason, the complainant organization considers that the directive is purely arbitrary, a caprice of the executive power, tainted with arbitrariness, and should be condemned.
.The claimant states that the provincial state of Entre Ros and the General Education Council are not only violating the guarantee of the right to strike by deducting days without following due legal process, but are also in contravention of the international human rights treaties ratified by the Argentine State, ignoring and subjugating their obligations which must be fulfilled on pain of incurring liability under international law. It is thus all the more evident that an act is being committed which lacks any justification, reasonableness of any kind and is totally without legality. For its part, Circular No. /, on the subject of Reporting on strike days by all employees under the General Education Council?and addressed to departmental managements by the Department of Adjustments and Settlements of the General Education Council, states, with reference to the absence of teachers to participate in the strikes: In the case concerned here, it is a case of absence, justified by direct industrial action, i.e. not leave requested by the teacher, but failure to attend their place of work ? This circular implemented an administrative system for cases when teachers are absent to take part in industrial action, despite the fact that, for the educational body, the offence of strike is, in its own words, an absence justified by direct industrial action? It should be clear that the provincial state, which is the teachers?employer, cannot qualify an industrial action as legal or illegal, since it does not have the power to do so. Even if it did have such power, in so doing, it assumes the dual role or judge and party, and cannot claim to settle a dispute based on its own rules which censure all strikes by an incorrect and irrational qualification of illegality. The administrative authority cannot even qualify direct industrial action as such, since that decision is solely reserved for the courts.
.It is quite clear that the deductions from wages, while not overturning the guarantee of the right to strike, equals to an unacceptable restriction of that right, since the provincial executive power thereby assumes powers that it does not possess. In the case of the teachers affected by the deductions from their pay, it conspires against the integrity of the salary, which is certainly of a subsistence nature, and thus unfairly affects the right of property, the inalienability of which is guaranteed by article  of the National Constitution.",3,2010,Argentina
123,"The provincial state is not only failing in its duty to provide fair remuneration? which must be revised for the cost of living, but is in clear breach of the contract between the administration and its employees, and, for this, there is no legal basis.
.The complainant organization indicates that both national and provincial legislation emphasize the different consequences which a strike may cause to the workers involved, depending on whether or not the strike has been declared illegal. Thus, for example, in the case of ADEMYS Teachers?Association against GCBA on incidental processes, the Catamarca and Tucuman Appeal Court, nd Chamber, Case No. /?held that ??.The judge in the lower court allowed the preventive injunction requested by ADEMYS that the administration should refrain from any act or event which, as a consequence of the industrial action taken by the teachers sector on  and  September ; , , ,  and  October ;  and  November ; , ,  and  March and  and April , would affect the full payment of their wages? It therefore ordered the immediate restitution of the sums which has been deducted on those grounds.
.The complainant organization states that in the present case, the strike was lawful since it had not been declared unlawful or illegal, and because it was lawful, it must be protected by the legal order and, also because it was lawful, it could not give rise to loss for the workers who took part.
.The complainant organization adds that since , in the province of Entre Ros, Act No. has been in force, which provides for the institution of the Collective Agreement for Teachers between the General Education Council of the province of Entre Ros, as employer, and the teachers?associations with trade union status, in order to agree conditions of work, wages and all matters pertinent to the employment relationship of teachers ?(article ). This Act, which was a victory for the teachers in the province, despite being clear as to its procedure, has on several occasions been subject to a distorted and extortionate interpretation and application by provincial governments and the General Education Council (especially during the industrial disputes in mid- and early ).
.During , events occurred which were a repeat of unfair and anti-trade union practices, and the same occurred in . It was a well known and established fact that the AGMER had planned to hold a congress in which decisions would be taken relating to future industrial action on  July . Despite the fact that the authorities of the General Education Council and the provincial government had been fully informed of the holding of the meeting on  July, on that very same day, the President of the General Education Council issued a convocation to a joint meeting which, surprisingly, was accepted by the administrative body, and the trade unions were convened and notified. This notice reached the trade union after the industrial action had been decided, as shown by a copy of the resolutions of the congress. The trade union refused the convocation because it considered it to be in bad faith on the part of the employer, given that it infringed the provisions of article  of the abovementioned Act No.  on Collective Bargaining, where it states: the parties shall be obliged to negotiate in good faith. This principle implies the following rights and obligations for the parties: (a) attendance at negotiations and hearings notified in due form, with sufficient powers ?(e) making efforts conducive to reaching agreements which take into account the various circumstances of the case?
.According to the complainants, none of the above conditions were fulfilled. In their opinion, there is a clear case of bad faith in a self-serving convocation on the same day as decisions were to take place and announced previously by all public media in the province and, as if that were not enough, the State itself failed to produce a wage offer by  June . Furthermore, it should also be noted that neither the General Education Council nor the provincial government made efforts conducive to reaching an agreement, but simply maintained silence and then, on the day that decisions were to be taken by the trade unions, they requested the opening of the collective bargaining process. As if that was not enough, before the notice of refusal expressed by the trade unions, the President of the General Education Council,  days later, asked the Director of the Provincial Labour Directorate to reiterate the convocation, which never happened, but the reason for that omission by the administrative body was not explained. It should be explained that the Director of the Provincial Labour Directorate had ample powers to reconvene the parties, as the bargaining process never started, because of the bad faith of the employer. Thus far, it is reasonable to assume that the collective bargaining process provided by law in specified forums had not begun.
.The complainant organization indicates this comes to the crux of the anti-union action. The General Education Council, despite the required steps being very clear, applied to the labour court requesting compulsory conciliation, giving rise to the action General Education Council v. Teachers?Association of Entre Ros and Association of Technical Teachers re Compulsory Conciliation, Act No. ?which was heard in Labour Court No.  of Paran. The labour judge, entirely and absolutely incorrectly, ordered compulsory conciliation because she considered that: ?from Case No. , filed in the Provincial Labour Directorate, emerges the substantiation of the various stages which, under the law, must be considered, on the one hand, the existence of a collective industrial dispute as defined by law and, on the other, the convening of a conciliation hearing and its failure ?In this context, and in accordance with the foregoing legal provision, the Director of the Provincial Labour Directorate, after notification of the direct action measures and the application submitted by the President of the General Education Council, decided in a resolution dated  July to convene the collective bargaining committee on  July. The trade unions having been notified, they refused to attend the invitation to the meeting, an act of refusal which, apart from the reasons on which the refusal was based which fall outside the matters to be considered under the law, implies in fact a refusal to continue the dialogue and is thus an act, failure to attend, which closes the administrative hearing, exercised in favour of the freedom to exercise the rights to which they are entitled?and thus giving rise to the conditions set out in article  of Act No.  ?
.The complainant adds that, as another clear demonstration of unfair conduct and bad faith, the General Education Council requested compulsory conciliation before the court on August , i.e. one day before the commencement of the industrial action (strikes) which were to take place on ,  and  August . In other words, one month later than that fixed by the Provincial Labour Directorate (which was for  July ), the General Education Council requested the conciliation based on a decision of the AGMER congress (refusal of the convocation to the administrative collective bargaining meeting) communicated by the trade union on  July , i.e. one month and  days before the application to the court. In light of this court decision, the AGMER lodged an appeal, which was granted by the appeal judge, i.e. the court decision was not upheld and, consequently, was not enforceable.
.According to the complainant organization, the provincial government, at the time when the judicial measure was requested on  June , did not have any offer to make. One must wonder, therefore, what was the core and principal purpose of initiating a collective bargaining process by the provincial executive, if its opposite number had replied that the proposal was insufficient and the latter, in turn, stated that there was no better offer or any possibility of one. The answer is obvious; the only intention is to use the collective bargaining mechanism to stop direct action measures decided by the trade unions. It should be noted that since the start of the proceedings, the conduct of the authorities could be characterized as in bad faith, in that they certainly already knew the answer that would be given by the workers?side. Despite that, the teachers of the province, long-time advocates of dialogue, decided to participate in the bargaining committee with the object, logically, of obtaining a different result from that which, unfortunately, due to the employers action, occurred and which consisted of the total breakdown of the bargaining process in the administrative forum.
.According to the complainant, the bad faith is evident not only in the request to convene a joint meeting, as described, but also the entire bargaining process conducted by the administrative side. The AGMER indicates that on  March , the employers attended and said that the offer was a wage increase involving a monthly outlay of some  million pesos ? As this was exactly the",3,2010,Argentina
124,"same wage offer that had already been rejected by the teachers?unions, the AGMER members included on the agenda, among other things, holding a budget and wage discussion, taking into account that the union congress had already rejected, as insufficient, the offer formulated by the Government of the Province on  February , the same as expressed in this offer, relating to an increase which involves a monthly outlay of some seven million pesos ? To this, the representatives of the General Education Council replied stating the need to have a break to respond to the points included by the teachers?representatives. The complainant adds that it was then, in the reply given hours later, that the employers?true intention and bad faith became clear. Thus, with regard to the applications, they maintain that: There will be no derogation to the provisions set out in the document of  March  to strengthen the administrative legal order governing the education system, in relation to the return of days deducted for strikes in  and non-execution of deductions for strikes in , we uphold the decision of the provincial government to pay days actually worked; it also offers to advance, in addition to the initial wage offer made yesterday, the payment of the teachers incentive initially set at six instalments from July  to December , to three instalments in May, July and September this year.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The complainant maintains that what looks like an offer is no such thing. This offer constitutes late payment of a debt by the National State and the Provincial State to the teachers of Entre Ros which dates from . Moreover, the offer is to pay it in instalments and without any interest or adjustment. The President of the General Education Council herself said that the teaching incentive is a responsibility of the National Government, since the province was only an intermediary between the payer and the beneficiary, and that the Nation does not consider it a debt to the teaching sector. Given the total absence of a reply to any of the bargaining points included by the parties, the bargaining session broke down.
.The complainant organization indicates that neither the General Education Council nor the Government made efforts conducive to reaching agreement, but simply maintained the same offer and even tried to deck it out?with an improvement by promising to pay sums owed for several years (teaching incentive) and by another debtor (the National State) which had already announced the advance which they wanted to make as an additional or improved offer. The employers have never used this collective bargaining mechanism in times of peace? and all their actions are confined to invoking the Act on Collective Bargaining for the sole purpose of disrupting or stopping industrial action, generally strikes decided by teachers when for a long time their claims for better conditions of work have been ignored. This is what shows the bad faith argued above, in that, for the employer, this does not and never has constituted a genuine tool for bargaining with its employees as the law intended. They respect neither its spirit nor its letter.
.The complainant organization states that unlike the unfair attitude and bad faith shown by the employers action, on  March , i.e. two days after calling for collective bargaining during , it issued Resolution No. / CGE which states: article : authorize departmental heads of schools, after identifying head teachers who did not report the non-attendance of teaching staff of their schools, due to strikes by those staff during , to apply to them the so-called warning? which is recorded in their personnel record...? This regulation implies totally unfair conduct and, moreover, is clearly unconstitutional, as, among other things, it applies a general and indiscriminate sanction without any consideration of the particular situation of each head teacher, it attacks the principle of innocence, the right of defence, due process, the principle of legality of all rights and guarantees of constitutional and supra-legal rank contained in international treaties. According to the complainant, the genesis of this provision clearly shows that the employer is acting in bad faith, by requesting a bargaining round and two days later, without giving any reasons, without listening, without requiring discharge, without any possibility of defence, punishes head teachers who did not report the non-attendance of teaching staff.
.This punishment is imposed on head teachers without any sanction being provided at any time by legislation, as the relevant legislation (Entre Ros Teachers?Regulations) does not contain warning?entered in the personnel record as a possible sanction (article  and following), without any possibility of defence. This resolution has only one purpose: persecution of those who exercised the legitimate right to strike and for that reason did not attend work. We must not fail to point out that head teachers are not civil servants but teachers who are promoted to management posts by competitive selection in accordance with rules issued by the State itself. They are not seconded civil servants and thus do not have legal personality in their own right, they have their own system of authorization, a salary scale common to all employees subject to the General Education Council and, as such, are covered by the Teachers?Regulations, for which reason they have the same rights and obligations as the rest of the sector, including the right to take industrial action.
.This anti-union attitude displayed by the State is designed to discourage?industrial action by trade unions, as those affected see that if they observe the decisions of the teachers?unions, even though made within the framework of the law, as in this case, they will be individually?attacked by the employer. Finally, another significant fact because of its political implications, impact on trade unions and manifest impact on rights, is the criminal prosecution of trade union leaders of the Teachers?Association of Entre Ros.
.The AGMER indicates that, in the face of the clear violation of the law evidenced by the bad faith of the state employer, it decided not to accept compulsory conciliation and to confirm the strikes on  and  August  and to instruct its lawyers to file the corresponding appeal against the court order which incorrectly ordered compulsory conciliation. Subsequently, the employers appeared before the labour court and requested legal measures to be taken in relation to the failure to comply with the appealed court order, in clear reference to the initiation of a criminal prosecution for alleged commission of an offence under the Argentine Criminal Code. Specifically, proceedings were initiated against Elizar Sergio, Madoz Marta, Budino Luis Csar, Snchez Zulma, Snchez Norma and Rodrguez Patricia for contempt of court? These proceedings are being heard in Magistrates Court No. , in the town of Paran, Case No. . This offence for which the officials, at the time members of the central executive committee of the Teachers?Association of Entre Ros, are being investigated, is set out in article  of the Criminal Code which provides that a person who disobeys a public official in the legitimate exercise of his functions shall be punishable by a prison sentence of  days to one year?
.Apart from the fact that in the present case, there is no offence, there was no contempt of court nor did those now charged act in any way illegally. It should be emphasized that when the State itself resorts to the criminal law, it is because it seeks to escalate the industrial dispute with the vehemence engendered by the power of punishment. In a democratic State subject to the rule of law, the power of punishment is, at the least, a last resort, i.e. it arises when there is no other law that can be applied. However, in the present case, an industrial dispute which is supposed to be settled by conciliation of the parties, this is incompatible with conduct which criminalizes the constitutional right to strike and the labour and administrative right to fight for the integrity of their wages and fair increases, decent and fair conditions of work, and health and safety at work.
.It should be emphasized that the accused in the criminal case are teachers who held office as officials of Entre Ros teachers?trade unions, who were elected to defend their labour rights, which they did always strictly within the framework of the Constitution and the laws governing that activity. That is why it should be emphasized that the claims of the civil servants who initiated the case are intended to frighten workers who fight for their rights. The fact that a criminal prosecution has been instituted is solely for the purpose of creating a state of fear in the teaching profession.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that the Provincial Labour Directorate (DPT) of the Province of Entre Ros replied, in relation to the application of the Provincial Act No. / on Joint Negotiations, that, before considering the dispute in , it is necessary to describe briefly the disputes since , and show the attitude of the complainant organization throughout those disputes.
.On that",-1,2010,Argentina
125,"occasion, the DPT convened a hearing for August , arriving at an agreement in principle which was ultimately rejected by the trade union leadership, with a further strike on  and  August . Given that the dispute was escalating, compulsory conciliation was called within the time limit of days. This conciliation was not accepted and the powers of the Directorate to call it were challenged. Under the Federal Labour Pact (No. ) the proceedings were referred to the Secretariat of Labour of the Nation, in order to request its intervention to expedite the matter. The latter, by Resolution No./, recognized the competence and powers of the DPT to intervene in collective industrial disputes arising in the territory of the province. Thus, Resolution No. / of the DPT of  August  was issued, confirming the order for compulsory conciliation and indicating that the direct industrial action should cease. Neither was this measure accepted by the trade union. The DPT indicates that, despite the indications given and despite the failure to respect the bargaining measures, sanctions were not applied, nor was the right to strike infringed.
.The provincial authority adds that in , under the framework of the new regulation (articles  and  of Act No. ) the DPT was requested to intervene. The latter set the hearing for  July . The hearing was not attended by the complainant organization, despite having encouraged the drafting and passing of the Act. Article  of the Act provides for judicial intervention, by an order for compulsory conciliation, which was also not respected by the AGMER. The DPT emphasizes that, despite that, sanctions were not imposed.
.The provincial authority indicates that in , the AGMER announced industrial action for  and  July, and the General Education Council requested an order for compulsory conciliation. The President of the General Education Council indicates that, in application of the Act on Collective bargaining for Teachers, an increase was granted in two stages (Act of  February ), while bargaining continued. Resolution No. / of the DPT of  June  was not accepted and was disputed by the AGMER, arguing that Act No. on collective bargaining contained a mechanism which can lead to an order for compulsory conciliation by a national court, and in the present case, the employer was both judge and party in the matter. It explains that there was no collective bargaining mechanism in the province, as the province had adopted the terms of the National Act on Collective Bargaining for Teachers.
.On  July , the trade union was notified of the application for an order for compulsory conciliation. Upholding the provincial state on  July , the Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance, No. , Paran, Secretariat No.  in the case of Provincial Council for Children, Adolescents and the Family v. AGMER and others/precautionary injunction? the Court definitively confirmed the compulsory conciliation convened by the DPT. Despite that, the trade union again refused to comply with the order, and took direct industrial action on  and  July . On this occasion, the National Secretariat of Labour was asked to intervene, and it issued Resolution No. of  August , which ordered the AGMER to participate in the compulsory conciliation ordered by the General Labour Directorate of the Province of Entre Ros, subject to the provisions of article () of Act No. , which was notified to the trade union of  August .
.In conclusion, the provincial authority argues that the allegations contained in the complaint should be rejected in their entirety, as there had been no violation whatsoever of freedom of association. It emphasizes that the AGMER, as indicated, never complied with the provisions which, at national or provincial level, provide for compulsory conciliation prior to the adoption of direct industrial action. Moreover, despite that, no proceedings were ever adopted or initiated to apply sanctions. All the measures taken by the provincial authority were within its powers and competence to hear collective industrial disputes in its territory.
.The provincial authority adds to the information provided by the General Education Council of the province, concerning the other allegations made by the trade union, the following: () Sanctions on the grounds of exercise of the right to strike by teachers. It is emphatically denied that a financial penalty was imposed, since the right to strike is a right enshrined in the National Constitution, article bis, thus the exercise of that right is not punishable conduct. What was applied was non-payment of remuneration for nonattendance at work, which, while authorized by law, does not give rise to remuneration, because the only act which gives rise to remuneration is work; () Absence of prior proceedings. It is highlighted, primarily, that, in reality, it was the trade union itself which did not comply with the law, when it did not respect the conciliation procedure laid down, which in turn establishes that the proceedings must take place prior to strike action (article (f) of Act No. ). The latter must be initiated by the trade union which is promoting the strike action, which in this case specifically did not happen. It states that the trade union had already refused to comply with the court order for compulsory conciliation laid down in the provincial jurisdiction, which included the order to suspend the strike action pending conciliation proceedings (articles  and  of the Act). This conduct shows that it was the trade union itself, which did not observe the law and the proceedings prior to taking direct industrial action (article (f) of Act No. ), as is shown in the previous paragraph. It is reiterated that, even so, the strike action was not declared illegal, but, simply, the days not worked were not paid and a settlement was sought through conciliation; () Bad faith in collective bargaining. The truth of the matter is that it is the trade union which openly and clearly rejected the conciliation route, which failed to attend judicial and administrative hearings and which discredited those proceedings. This wholly justifies the judicial proceeding which the Act on Collective Bargaining for Teachers, article , states very clearly: on the breakdown of the said administrative conciliation proceedings, any of the parties may apply to the labour court in the city of Paran for a compulsory conciliation order? However, the trade union refused judicial conciliation, yet, quite paradoxically, used it to examine and reject the Government offer. In short, it appears that the trade union considers that the collective bargaining process is a victory for the workers when they achieve the results sought by the trade union and discredit it when that is not the case; () Administrative proceedings against head teachers. It explains mildly that the warning?is not a punishment. It does not have punitive character and no penalty is applicable. It is a corrective measure set out in Resolution No. / of the General Education Council of  May , which governs the procedure for the preparation of the teachers annual assessment. These measures do not give rise to any diminution in the assessment score, unlike disciplinary measure; and () Criminal prosecution of trade union leaders. The General Education Council points out that the complainant organization should have accepted the court decision which ordered the compulsory conciliation, and that non-compliance with a judicial decision in any system is an offence. It considers, lastly, that the comments on state public policies are irrelevant to the central reason for the complaint, i.e. the exercise of the right to strike by state teachers.
.The provincial authority indicates that there are no grounds for the present complaint, since, even with the profusion of dates and details provided by the trade union, the Act on Collective Bargaining for Teachers was applied, and that Act was approved with the active participation of the AGMER and, secondly, article  provides on the breakdown of the said administrative conciliation proceedings, any of the parties may apply to the labour court in the city of Paran for a compulsory conciliation order?
.The Committee observes that in the present case, the complainant organization alleges lack of good faith on the part of the Government of the Province of Entre Ros and the General Education Council in collective bargaining in the education sector (offers of supposed improvements outside the scope of the provincial powers, absence of genuine offers of wage increases or illegal offers of payments and refusal to consider claims concerning conditions of work) and disputes the decision of the authorities of the province to make deductions from wages for days of legal strikes carried out in the sector in . The complainant organization also alleges that head teachers were punished for not communicating the names of teachers who took part in the strike and that criminal proceedings for contempt of court in relation to the compulsory conciliation order were initiated against the trade union leaders named in the complaint.
.With respect to the alleged lack of good faith on the part of the provincial authorities in",3,2010,Argentina
126,"the collective bargaining, the Committee notes that the Government of the Province of Entre Ros indicates that the complainant organization had repeatedly refused conciliation on the matters under negotiation, and that the authorities had not imposed sanctions, and in particular points out that: () during the direct industrial action in , compulsory conciliation was ordered which was rejected by the trade union but sanctions were not imposed; () in the context of the dispute in , the DPT invited the parties to a hearing but the complainant organization did not accept the invitation and although the court ordered compulsory conciliation, the AGMER did not attend; () sanctions were not imposed on the complainant organization; () in , in the context of a new dispute, the AGMER again did not accept the compulsory conciliation which was ordered by the court; and () the AGMER had publicly and openly refused the conciliation route and did not attend administrative or court hearings.
.In this respect, the Committee finds that it is apparent from the allegations and the Governments reply that for years industrial relations in the teaching sector in the Province of Entre Ros have been attended with difficulties. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that it has on many occasions emphasized that it is important that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement; moreover genuine and constructive negotiations are a necessary component to establish and maintain a relationship of confidence between the parties [see Digest of Decisions and Principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the principle is respected.
.As regards the disputed decision to make deductions from teachers?wages for the days when they took part in a strike in , the Committee notes that the Government of the Province of Entre Ros states that a financial sanction was not applied, since the right to strike is a right enshrined in the National Constitution, but what was applied was non-payment of wages for non-attendance at work. The Committee considers that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles [see Digest, op. cit., para. ] and will therefore not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.With regard to the alleged sanctions warnings?which were apparently imposed on head teachers who did not communicate the names of teachers who took part in the strike, the Committee notes that the Government of the Province of Entre Ros states that the warning? () is not a sanction and is not punitive in character; () no penalty is applicable; and () it is a corrective measure set out in Resolution No. / of the General Education Council which does not give rise to any diminution on the professional assessment, unlike disciplinary measures. Taking this information into account, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.Lastly, with regard to the allegation concerning the initiation of criminal proceedings for contempt of court in relation to the compulsory conciliation order against the trade union officials named in the complaint, the Committee notes that the Government of the Province states that failure to comply with a court decision in any system is an offence. The Committee recalls that no one should be deprived of their freedom or be subject to penal sanctions for the mere fact of organizing or participating in a peaceful strike [see Digest, op. cit., para. ] and requests the Government to provide a copy of the final judgment.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee recalls that no one should be deprived of their freedom or be subject to penal sanctions for the mere fact of organizing or participating in a peaceful strike and requests the Government to provide a copy of the final judgment relating to the criminal proceedings for contempt of court in relation to the compulsory conciliation order against trade union officials of the AGMER named in the complaint.",3,2010,Argentina
127,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) and the Educational Workers?Association of Neuqun (ATEN).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated August .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  May , the ATEN and the CTERA indicate that a legal and union-related situation has arisen that is prejudicial to state education workers in the province of Neuqun in Argentina, which constitutes a flagrant disregard of internationally accepted principles which, inasmuch as they have been incorporated into Argentinas own legislation, guarantee freedom of association and the right to strike.
.The complainant organizations state that they are referring to the issuance of Decree No./ dated  May  by the executive authority of Neuqun province concerning the non-recognition of the right to strike, as education has once again been designated as an essential service? with minimum staffing levels?being introduced in educational establishments and directors being obliged to report on attendance, thereby preventing teachers in the province from exercising the right to strike and providing for sanctions to be applied to education workers who attempt to take collective and direct action measures.
.In particular, the complainant organizations indicate that the abovementioned decree, in its operative part, provides as follows:Section : In Neuqun province, education during the period of compulsory schooling is designated as an essential public service.Section : Minimum staffing levels are set for educational establishments, to ensure:(a) that the educational establishment can open and that the pupils can remain there throughout the school day;(b) that at least  per cent of classes, at all levels and structures of the provincial education system, can take place on any given school day.Section : Minimum staffing levels are set for special schools, boarding schools, schools with residential facilities and schools that provide meals, to ensure:(a) that the educational establishment can open and that the pupils can remain there with the necessary comprehensive assistance throughout the school day;(b) that  per cent of classes, and all activities corresponding to these types of schools, at all levels and structures of the provincial education system, can take place on any given school day.Section : In the event of a failure to comply with the provisions of the preceding sections, the competent educational authority may call upon supply teachers and non-teaching staff and may use the mechanisms that it considers necessary to enable educational establishments to operate, as appropriate.Section : The directors or managers of each educational establishment, in their capacity as public servants, must keep a daily record of the attendance and absences of their staff and have a duty to provide information in this regard to the higher authority the following working day.Section : Failure to comply with any of the obligations set out in the present legal standard constitutes a serious offence and carries the penalties established by the legislation in force.Section : The Secretary of State for Education, Culture and Sport and the President of the Provincial Education Council are called upon to determine which mechanisms are needed to put into effect the provisions of the present decree, taking into account the specific needs and characteristics of each educational establishment, the number of pupils and the teaching methods that are used.Section : A copy of the present decree shall be sent to the legislature of Neuqun province, in line with usual practice.
.The complainant organizations allege that, in the light of the above, a blatant violation of freedom of association has been occurring, in particular as a result of the actions of the authorities of Neuqun province, which are trying to exercise functions that are expressly outside their remit. This situation is without doubt due to a transgression of the Constitution and to certain legislative loopholes to which the State of Argentina as a whole must respond. The complainants explain that the labour dispute arose in Neuqun province as a result of the failure of the ATEN and the provincial government to reach a final agreement, despite the existence of a joint agreement reached at the national level between the CTERA and the national Government, dated February , under which a wage increase of more than  per cent will be achieved.
.The complainant organizations add that, in accordance with the statutes of the CTERA, which have been duly registered with the National Ministry of Labour, and with the specific provisions of Act No.  on trade union associations, trade unions are guaranteed, in terms of collective freedom of association, the right to formulate their own action plans and to carry out any lawful activity to defend the interests of workers. In particular, they may exercise the right to bargain collectively, the right to participate, the right to strike and the right to take other forms of legitimate trade union action?(section(d) of Act No. ). In addition, the national Constitution contains a strong operative clause, establishing a sequence to be followed: Trade unions are guaranteed the right to enter into collective agreements, to have recourse to conciliation and arbitration and to strike?(section bis, second paragraph). It is clear that, according to the Constitution, the first step is to negotiate, reach agreement, restore balance, correct inequities and ensure bargaining parity between unions and employers through the introduction of legislation negotiated as part of a collective agreement; the next step is to establish dispute prevention mechanisms based on conciliation and voluntary arbitration (although the Constitution does not indicate whether this should be a government activity); and finally, as a last resort, the power of the union to exercise the right to strike (the legitimate use of force). A collective process was foreseen that, even in the worst of cases, should be completed without any legal obstacles.
.According to the complainant organizations, the national Constitution does not set any limits or conditions, as is the case with other constitutions. Therefore, the collective law institutions provided for by the Constitution are characterized by their strong capacity to act immediately and efficiently. Accordingly, the right to strike may be invoked and exercised even though there is no regulatory act passed by Congress governing this right, because exercising the right to strike does not require legislative regulation. Article () of the Constitution of Argentina provides for the recognition of the constitutional status of human rights declarations and treaties. Of the human rights instruments, only the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights explicitly refers to the right to strike (section .(d)). Nevertheless, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the American Convention on Human Rights encompass the right to strike as part of the right to freedom of association.
.The complainant organizations state that there are no ILO Conventions or Recommendations specifically governing the right to strike, but that the right is seen as being implicit in the right to freedom of association enshrined in Conventions Nos  and  and in the right to collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. . They also state that a new interaction appears in section  of Act No.  in relation to disputes concerning essential services: Essential services are defined as being health and hospital services, the production and distribution of drinking water, electricity and gas and air traffic control. An activity that is not included in the above list may, on an exceptional basis, be designated as an essential service by an independent commission established in accordance with the regulations? Accordingly, the complainant organizations consider that, according to national legislation, education neither is nor could be an essential service, in view of the above and of the principles of the ILO supervisory bodies. According to the complainant organizations, it is worth mentioning that, on  March , the national executive authority issued regulatory Decree No. / on the Guarantees Commission as provided for under section  of Act No. , for the purposes foreseen in that provision, in other words with a view to designating on an exceptional basis activities that do not feature on the abovementioned list.
.The complainant organizations are truly surprised by the illegal and arbitrary way in which Decree No. / was issued by the executive authority of Neuqun province, which is clearly in no way in line with the principles of the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association. It cannot be claimed, as is inferred from the issuance of Decree No. / by the executive authority of Neuqun province, that regulating the right to strike falls within the remit of the provincial authorities. The complainant organizations claim that they do not share the assumptions that are set out in the introductory clauses of Decree No. /, according to which the section  in question of Act No.  allows education to be",-1,2010,Argentina
128,"designated as an essential service.
.The complainants maintain that education is not an essential service, but a social right that should be guaranteed by the State. Decree No. / of the provincial government constitutes a clear regulatory excess, insofar as it attempts to regulate a constitutional right, but especially insofar as it does not comply with the decisions, guidance and conclusions of the Committee on Freedom of Association. The complainant organizations conclude by indicating that the designation of education as an essential service, the introduction of minimum staffing levels?and the obligation on the directors of educational establishments to inform on teaching staff who exercise the right to strike, as provided for under Decree No. / of the State of Neuqun province, are acts that are in blatant violation of the decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In its communication of August , the Government reports that, according to the executive authority of the province, it is necessary to describe the situation prior to the issuance of Decision No. /. Specifically, the executive authority of the province indicates that for six months prior to the start of the academic year and while industrial action was being taken, negotiations were being held between the complainant trade union, the Board of Education and the provincial government (November and December  and February, March and April ). In view of the ongoing disagreement, Decision No./ was issued on  April  calling for compulsory conciliation (Case No.-/ entitled Secretary of State for Education, Culture and Sports, concerning compulsory conciliation order, teaching dispute?.
.The provincial government adds that, despite the appeal for compulsory conciliation, the union ATEN refused to recognize the authority of the Office of the Under-Secretary of Labour to convene such conciliation proceedings, did not attend the notified hearings and continued its ongoing industrial action, resulting in a total of  days with no classes and the setting up of roadblocks. It indicates that it was under these circumstances that Decision No. / was issued, closing the conciliation phase and ordering the initiation of examination proceedings. In this instance, and giving priority to the right to education, the executive authority of the province issued Decision No. /, which is challenged in the complaint.
.The provincial government indicates that, on  May , an agreement was signed on wages and the consequent lifting of industrial action. The executive authority of the province states that the teachers?union did not change its position before the start of the corresponding academic year; in other words, it continued to take direct action, resulting thereafter in the loss of classes with no opportunities for replacement classes, in complete and systematic disregard for existing legal practice. The provincial governments intention when it issued its decisions, and as has been seen throughout the course of the dispute, was not in any way to limit the right of teachers to strike, but basically to ensure the right of children to education and health, in accordance with the obligations enshrined in the Constitution. Furthermore, it considers that, given the context, the administrative measure that was taken does not warrant any sanction.
.Finally, with reference to Case No. , the Government considers it important to note that ATEN represents only the teaching staff who are a party to the dispute, and not the directors and deputy directors, who enjoy the status of political officials, in other words representatives of the public authority responsible for running educational establishments.
.With regard to the Guarantees Commission, which is in fact governed by Decree No. / (and was established under section  of Act No. ), the Government indicates that section  of Act No.  provided that the obligation to continue to provide a minimum service during a strike or work stoppage is enforceable only in cases where a direct action measure affects the provision of an essential service in accordance with the criteria established in that respect by the supervisory bodies of the ILO, namely, with regard to health and hospital services, the production and distribution of drinking water, electricity and gas and air traffic control. Accordingly, the standard in question provided that only on an exceptional basis can activities other than those listed be designated as essential services, through an independent commission, prior to the opening of the conciliation procedure provided for by law and only under the following circumstances: (a) when the duration and geographical extent of the interruption of activity mean that the implementation of the measure might endanger the life or safety of all or part of the population; and (b) when it is a public service of vital importance. According to the information provided by the provincial authority, neither of these conditions were fulfilled, and an agreement with the union could be reached, meaning that the dispute did not fit appropriately into the category of situations for which the intervention of the Guarantees Commission is envisaged, in accordance with the provisions of section  of Act No..
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations object to Decree No. / dated  May  issued by the executive authority of Neuqun province, which establishes that, in Neuqun province, education during the period of compulsory schooling is designated as an essential public service and sets minimum staffing levels (minimum service) for  per cent of classes and for  per cent of classes in special schools, boarding schools, schools with residential facilities and schools that provide school meals; the complainant organizations also object to the provision of the decree that states that the directors or managers of each educational establishment must keep a daily record of the attendance and absences of their staff and provide this information to the higher authority.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the Neuqun province reported that: () it is necessary to describe the situation prior to the issuance of Decision No./; specifically, for six months prior to the start of the academic year and while industrial action was being taken, negotiations were being held between the complainant trade union, the Board of Education and the provincial government and, in view of the ongoing disagreement, Decision No. / was issued on  April  calling for compulsory conciliation; () despite the appeal for compulsory conciliation, the union ATEN refused to recognize the authority of the Office of the Under-Secretary of Labour to convene such conciliation proceedings, took ongoing industrial action ?for  days no classes were given ?and set up roadblocks; () it is under these circumstances that Decision No. /, closing the conciliation phase, and Decision No. /, which is challenged in the complaint, were issued; () on  May , an agreement was signed on wages and the consequent lifting of industrial action; () prior to the start of the academic year in question, the teachers?union took direct action, resulting thereafter in the loss of classes with no opportunities for replacement classes, in complete and systematic disregard for existing legal practice; () the provincial governments intention when it issued the abovementioned decisions and throughout the course of the dispute was not in any way to limit the right of teachers to strike, but basically to ensure the right of children to education and health, in accordance with the obligations enshrined in the Constitution; () Act No.  provided that only on an exceptional basis can activities other than those listed (health and hospital services, the production and distribution of drinking water, electricity and gas and air traffic control) be designated as essential services, through an independent commission, prior to the opening of the conciliation procedure provided for by law and only under the following circumstances: (a) when the duration and geographical extent of the interruption of activity mean that the implementation of the measure might endanger the life or safety of all or part of the population; and (b) when it is a public service of vital importance; and that, as neither of these conditions were fulfilled, and because an agreement could be reached with the union, the dispute did not fit appropriately into the category of situations for which the intervention of the Guarantees Commission is foreseen.
.First of all, the Committee observes that the dispute and the strike that gave rise to Decision No. /, which is contested by the complainant organizations, were settled as a result of an agreement reached by the parties in May . The Committee recalls that it has been called upon in the past to examine a case against the Government of Argentina relating to allegations of limitations on the right to strike in the education sector in Neuqun province and that, on that occasion, it emphasized that the education sector in general does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term and recalled that minimum services may be established in the education sector, in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strikes of long duration [see th Report, Case No. , paragraph ]. Furthermore, the Committee has considered that the provision of food",3,2010,Argentina
129,"to pupils of school age and the cleaning of schools may be considered essential services in the strict sense of the term [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paragraph ].
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the Government indicates that the industrial action continued for a period of  days and that subsequently Decree No./ was issued, imposing minimum services, but the Government does not mention holding consultations with the social partners on the scope of the minimum services. Bearing in mind that, in Argentina, the right to strike exists in the education sector in a broad sense, but that in this specific case the organizations of employers and workers concerned were not consulted with regard to the minimum services, the Committee requests with insistence the Government to ensure that, in the future, in the event of a dispute in the education sector in Argentina involving a strike of long duration, measures are taken to ensure that not only the public authorities but also the organizations of workers and employers concerned participate in defining the minimum service. The Committee recalls that this had already been requested previously in the context of Case No. . Accordingly, the Committee requests the Government to confirm that Decree No. / issued by Neuqun province is no longer in force.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to confirm that Decree No. / issued by Neuqun province is no longer in force. The Committee requests with insistence that, in the future, in the event of a strike of long duration in the education sector in the aforementioned province, the Government will take measures to ensure that not only the public authorities but also the organizations of workers and employers concerned participate in defining the minimum service.",-1,2010,Argentina
130,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the Argentine Judicial Federation (FJA) and the Trade Union Association of the Employees and the Officers of the Judicial Authority of the Province of Mendoza dated  April . The complainant organizations sent new allegations in a communication dated  August .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations: () object to the ruling issued by the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security of the Executive Authority of the Province of Mendoza opening a compulsory conciliation process (within the framework of a salary dispute) between the complainants, the provincial Executive Administration and the SCJM (the complainants state that they have constantly challenged the competence of the abovementioned Subsecretariat to intervene as an impartial body in order to resolve a dispute); and () allege that, although the dispute was resolved on April  and an agreement was signed under which the provincial Executive Authority undertook not to impose sanctions, the said authority did not respect the agreement, imposing a fine on the trade union organizations that was several times larger than their assets for failure to participate in the compulsory conciliation process.
.As to the contested compulsory conciliation process instituted by the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security of the Executive Authority of the Province of Mendoza within the framework of a salary dispute, the Committee notes that the Government states that it contacted the Subsecretariat in question and received the following response: () the legislative framework within which the negotiations were carried out consisted of Act No., provincial Decree No. /, provincial Act No.  establishing the Subsecretariat of Labour of the Province of Mendoza and the agreement dated  June  reached between the parties to the joint dialogue in the judicial sector; () the salary negotiations completed between the trade union, the SCJM and the provincial Executive Authority continued into  and meetings were set in accordance with the wishes of the parties, or the calendar of the joint dialogue which called for two meetings per month; ()on  March , the trade union began to carry out direct action, consisting of strikes by the staff of the Judicial Authority but, despite the direct action carried out, the mbito paritario continued to be held, with meetings in which the parties exchanged offers and established their positions regarding salaries and other issues; () as a result of the fact that the judicial service of the Province of Mendoza was almost completely paralysed, the spread of the strike to the penal service and the danger posed by this situation to the general population, through Decree No.  of  April  the SCJM requested the Governor of the province to institute a compulsory conciliation process as regards the dispute in question. At the time of the request of the SCJM, industrial action had been taken on ,  and  March and on ?, ?,  and  April ; () on  April , Ruling No.  was issued in which the Subsecretariat of Labour instituted a compulsory conciliation process regarding the dispute in question. The second article of the ruling states that the parties in dispute shall abstain from taking direct action for the duration of the dispute, with normal services being resumed immediately. The parties were notified of that ruling but the trade union did not comply with it, continuing to carry out direct action. Despite all of this, the mbito paritario continued to function, and a salary agreement was reached on  April  within that forum; () it should be noted that, faced with the trade unions disregard for the authority of the Subsecretariat of Labour as the body within which the joint dialogue process is carried out, and for the powers granted to the administrative authority by Act No.  and Decree No. / regarding the joint dialogue, and at the request of the other parties involved in the joint dialogue, on November , Ruling No. / was issued expressly establishing the scope of competence of the body as regards the joint dialogue process (the Trade Union Association of the Employees and the Officers of the Judicial Authority of the Province of Mendoza being notified of that ruling without lodging any kind of appeal against it). According to the Government, the legislation applied is appropriate and known to all the parties involved in the dispute. In particular, the trade union was informed of the measure, without the provincial administrative authority being aware at any point of its opposition until the present complaint was submitted.
.As to the allegation concerning the compulsory conciliation process, the Committee notes that the salary dispute which gave rise to the strike ( days of industrial action) and the summons to the compulsory conciliation process took place within the framework of the Judicial Authority of the Province of Mendoza and recalls that it has, on numerous occasions, stated that Officials working in the administration of justice and the judiciary are officials who exercise authority in the name of the State and whose right to strike could thus be subject to restrictions, such as its suspension or even prohibition?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee has stated on previous occasions that Legislation which provides for voluntary conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before a strike may be called cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association and, in general, a decision to suspend a strike for a reasonable period so as to allow the parties to seek a negotiated solution through mediation or conciliation efforts, does not in itself constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association?[see Digest, op. cit., paras ?]. In these circumstances and bearing in mind the aforementioned principles, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.As to the allegation that the provincial Executive Authority did not respect the agreement which ended the salary dispute in question, imposing a fine on the trade union organizations (the amount of which was several times higher than their assets) for failure to participate in the compulsory conciliation process, despite the fact that, according to the complainant organizations, the provincial Executive undertook not to apply sanctions, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations in that regard. In that respect, the Committee observes that the complainant organizations do not specify the amount of the fine they received. In these circumstances, while observing that the documentation sent by the complainants includes a contravention notice (under Act No. establishing the violation by any of the parties of rulings issued regarding compulsory conciliation processes as a very serious infraction) summoning the complainant organizations to defend themselves and discharge themselves of the allegations, the Committee recalls that agreements should be binding on the parties and that it is important that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement; moreover genuine and constructive negotiations are a necessary component to establish and maintain a relationship of confidence between the parties [seeDigest, op. cit., paras  and ], and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the agreement in question is respected and, if the agreement effectively expresses what is alleged by the complainant organizations, that the sanctions referred to by the complainants are not imposed.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:As to the allegation that the Executive Authority of the Province of Mendoza did not respect the agreement which ended the salary dispute in question, imposing a fine on the trade union organizations (the amount of which was several times higher than their assets) for failure to participate in the compulsory conciliation process, despite the fact that, according to the complainant organizations, the provincial Executive Authority undertook not to apply sanctions, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the agreement in question is respected and, if the agreement effectively expresses what is alleged by the complainant organizations that the sanctions referred to by the complainants are not imposed.",-1,2010,Argentina

.In a communication of May , the CTA names the  workers who were allegedly dismissed and states that the Government knew of them, as they were listed in an appendix to the document signed on  November , in the context of the dispute settlement committee of the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC), between the Office of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Economy and Production, and the Association of State Workers (ATE).
.In its communication dated  May , the Government submits the report of the Office of the Superintendent of Metropolitan Security of the federal police force on the events of  August  concerning the actions of the federal police infantry to prevent the installation of a protest stand outside the INDEC entrance. The report outlines the investigatory proceedings in a case characterized as assault on and resistance to authority? The Government states that the investigation found that it was the intervening law enforcement officers who were attacked. The Office of the Superintendents report gathers officers?statements that when the police informed the protesters that they could not set up their stands because they did not have the necessary authorization, a riot ensued, during which the protesters began to attack the police officers. As a result, the report states that a number of officers sustained various types of injury and the infantry had to intervene to restore order. The Government informs the Committee that the case is being handled by the Investigating Prosecutors Office, which will determine the responsibility of the relevant parties.
.In its communication of February , the Government encloses the INDEC report on the ongoing cases against Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte, an ATE delegate. INDEC alleges that it has been established that Mr Belforte committed fraud against the public administration by being absent without authorization and signing documents as if he had been performing services, for which he received compensation for census hours and overtime. In relation to the proceedings against Mr Belforte for fraud, INDEC informs the Committee that the criminal court concluded the case without a conviction and that the decision not to prosecute Mr Belforte is final. In its communication dated  May  in relation to the second case against Mr Belforte seeking to revoke his trade union immunity, the Government indicates that the proceedings are pending before the National Labour Appeals Chamber.
.In its communication of September , the Government submits a report by INDEC noting that the State complied with the agreement of  November  establishing the continued employment of the  workers named by the complainant who had allegedly been dismissed. INDEC indicates that the workers in question were not dismissed and are currently under contract, working for the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance.
.With regard to recommendation (a) from its previous examination of the case (on allegations concerning the events of  August , the intervention and violent suppression by the federal police infantry to prevent the installation of a protest stand outside the INDEC entrance), the Committee observes that, according to the investigation conducted by the Government, after informing the trade unionists that they could not set up stands without authorization, the law enforcement officers were attacked by the protesters, which resulted in several officers sustaining injuries. The Committee wishes to recall that the principles of freedom of association do not protect abuses consisting of criminal acts while exercising protest action. The Committee notes that the case is before the judge of the Investigating Prosecutors Office, who will determine the responsibilities. The Committee expects that the allegations of violent repression by the federal police of trade unionists who were setting up a protest stand will be brought to the attention of the judge so that they may be considered, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the proceedings.
.With regard to recommendation (b) from the previous examination of the case (outcome of the legal proceedings against the trade unionist Mr Belforte), the Committee notes that the criminal proceedings concerning the defrauding of the public administration were concluded without a conviction against Mr Belforte. With regard to the proceedings seeking to revoke Mr Belfortes trade union immunity, the Committee notes that the case is pending before the National Labour Appeals Chamber, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome.
.With regard to recommendation (c) of the previous examination of the case (allegations concerning the dismissal of  workers), the Committee duly notes the information provided by the Government that the  workers in question are under contract, in accordance with the agreement of  November  concerning their continued employment.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the proceedings before the judge of the Investigating Prosecutors Office concerning the allegations of attacks on police officers by trade unionists who were setting up a protest stand at the INDEC entrance. The Committee expects that the allegations of violent repression of the said trade unionists by the federal police will be brought to the attention of the judge so that they may be considered.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the ongoing proceedings seeking to revoke the trade union immunity of the ATE delegate, MrLuciano Osvaldo Belforte, before the National Labour Appeals Chamber.

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers?Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case at its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a)	With regard to the allegations relating to the intervention and violent repression by the Argentine federal police to prevent the installation of a protest stand at the INDEC entrance on  August , the Committee expects to receive the information referred to by the Government.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final result of the court proceedings against the ATE delegate Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte.(c)	As regards the alleged dismissal of  workers from the CPI and EPH Department on November  for having participated in meetings and direct action organized by the trade union, the Committee requests the CTA to send without delay the names of the workers who were allegedly dismissed so as to enable the Government to send concrete information on these allegations.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that, in compliance with the Committees latest recommendation, it has repeatedly requested details from the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Ministry of Security but that they have not yet sent the relevant information. As a result, the Government has been unable to formulate its response to the complaints.
.The Committee recalls that",1,2009,Argentina
132,"the allegations that were still pending in this case related to the intervention and violent repression by the federal police of Argentina aimed at preventing the installation of a protest stand outside the INDEC entrance on  August ; the court proceedings against the ATE delegate Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte; and the alleged dismissal of  workers from the Consumer Price Index and Continuous Household Survey Department, on  November , for having participated in meetings and direct action organized by the trade union (on the latter point, the Committee requested the CTA to send the names of the workers who were allegedly dismissed without delay so as to enable the Government to send concrete information on the allegations.
.Regarding the alleged dismissal of  workers (whose names the Committee requested from the complainant) from the Consumer Price Index and Continuous Household Survey Department, on  November , for having participated in meetings and direct action organized by the trade union, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that it has repeatedly requested details from the CTA and the Ministry of Security, but that they have not yet sent the necessary information, and that the Government has therefore been unable to formulate its response to the complaints. The Committee, recalling the importance of the complainants communication of detailed information and specific facts in order to enable it to reach a determination in full knowledge of the facts, once again invites the CTA to send the information it has requested and informs it that, if it fails to do so, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this aspect of the complaints.
.Regarding the alleged intervention and violent repression by the federal police of Argentina aimed at preventing the installation of a protest stand outside the INDEC entrance, on  August , the Committee regrets that the Government merely states that it has requested details from the Ministry of Security, which has not yet sent the relevant information. The Committee recalls that workers should enjoy the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests?and that in cases in which the dispersal of public meetings by the police has involved loss of life or serious injury, the Committee has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated immediately through an independent inquiry and to a regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification for the action taken by the police and to determine responsibilities?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee again requests the Government to send its observations on the matter without delay.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the ongoing court proceedings against the ATE delegate Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Regarding the alleged intervention and violent repression by the federal police of Argentina aimed at preventing the installation of a protest stand outside the INDEC entrance, on  August , the Committee again requests the Government to send its observations on the matter without delay.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the ongoing court proceedings against the ATE delegate Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte.(c)	Regarding the alleged dismissal of  workers (whose names the Committee requested from the complainant) from the Consumer Price Index and Continuous Household Survey Department, on  November , for having participated in meetings and direct action organized by the trade union, the Committee once again requests the CTA to send the names of the workers who were allegedly dismissed without delay so as to enable the Government to send concrete information on the allegations.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ?, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, (No. ), the Workers?Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case at its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an investigation is carried out without delay into the allegations relating to the intervention and violent repression by the PFA to prevent the erection of a protest stand at the INDEC entrance on  August  and that if it is found that the police overstepped the mark in the exercise of their functions, to take measures to remedy the situation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(b)	With regard to the allegations of attacks against the ATE trade union office in the INDEC main building on  May and  July  (according to the ATE, during the last attack damage was caused to the office), the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that an investigation is carried out into these allegations and to keep it informed of its outcome.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final result of the court proceedings against the ATE delegate, Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte, for defrauding the public administration. The Committee also requests the Government to inform it whether the delegate in question can freely enter the ATE trade union office in INDEC.(d)	Given that, according to the information supplied by the complainant organization, the judicial decisions ordered the reinstatement in their functions of the trade union official, Ms Liliana Haydee Gasco, and the worker Vanina Micello, the Committee requests the Government, should this be the case, to ensure compliance with the relevant judicial decisions and to keep it informed in this regard.(e)	The Committee urges the Government to send without delay its detailed observations relating to the following allegations: () the transfer of workplace of ATE member, MrEmilio Platzer; () the dismissal of ATE member, Ms Gabriela Soroka; () the removal from her post of ATE delegate, Ms Cynthia Pok; and () the dismissal of workers from the CPI and EPH Department on  November .(f)	The Committee invites the Government, with a view to achieving harmonious labour relations in the organization, to set up a forum for dialogue in which, among other things, the questions raised in this complaint can be dealt with.
.In its communication of  November , the Government indicates that it has sent the report drafted by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC) on the case.
.The INDEC indicates that its report contains updated information relating to the points on which the Committee requested information from the State of Argentina. The INDEC adds that the report focuses in particular on paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of the recommendations contained in paragraph  of the Committees th Report, as these are matters directly related to the Institutes remit. Specifically:?as regards paragraph (c), the INDEC indicates that the court proceedings in Luciano Belforte et al. in re: defrauding the public administration? instituted under file No./ in Criminal and Correctional Court No. , office , is still in progress. The court stayed the proceedings on  May . This stay was appealed by the prosecutor and the appeal is currently pending a decision from the Criminal Cassation Division of the Supreme Court of Justice. The INDEC has recently joined the proceedings as a complainant. Mr Belforte freely enters the central headquarters of the Institute on a daily basis. Furthermore, he was in office as a trade union delegate until  October  and, given that he enjoyed unrestricted movement within the Institute, it is assumed that he was able to perform his functions normally;?as regards paragraph (d), the INDEC indicates that Ms Vanina Micello and MsLiliana Hydee Gasco are currently working in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) Department pursuant to the court order to that effect;?as regards paragraph (e)(), the INDEC indicates that Mr Emilio Platzer performed tasks in the Institute under service provider contracts. The last of these ended in July. Since then, Mr Platzer no longer works in the INDEC; he was thus not transferred, but left at the end of his contract;?as regards paragraph (e)(), the INDEC indicates that Ms Gabriela Soroka was in a contractual relationship with the Institute under a cooperation agreement concluded between the INDEC and the Government of the city of Buenos Aires. Her employment relationship came to an end in November , not as a result of dismissal but because her contract had ended;?as regards paragraph (e)(), the INDEC indicates that Ms Cynthia Pok, an employee of the Institute, has not been removed from her post and is still a trade union delegate, an office which she took up in the exercise of her trade",-1,2009,Argentina
133,"union rights;?as regards paragraph (e)(), the INDEC indicates that the information provided by the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) is false or incorrect. According to the Institutes records, the only agreement implemented by an act meeting the aforementioned description dates from October and was signed by the individuals referred to in the Committees Report. Anexamination of its provisions provides only a generic description of the obligations undertaken by the parties, which makes it impossible to supply information on the situation of the workers referred to by the Committee. Moreover, the Committee does not mention the names of the workers in question, making it impossible to supply information on their current situation.
.By its March  communication, the Government transmits a report of the INDEC in which it is stated in respect of paragraph (a), that it has no jurisdiction to account for the action of the federal police of Argentina (the Government indicates that it will conduct consultations to provide relevant information on this issue), and with regard to paragraph(b), that the allegations have prompted the opening of an administrative proceeding which resulted in no disciplinary liability being imposed on any agent of the State.
.The Committee recalls that in this case the complainant organization alleged acts of violence (the intervention and violent repression by the Argentine federal police to prevent the erection of a protest stand at the entrance to the INDEC on  August ; attacks on workers at the meeting of  May , causing various injuries to the deputy secretary of Association of State Workers (ATE-Capital), Mr Luis Opromolla and two other workers, and striking MsCynthia Pok), intimidation by means of police presence and prevention of the exercise of trade union activity, attack against a trade union office and anti-union discrimination (initiation of legal proceedings for participating in the dispute between the ATE and the INDEC authorities, reprisals and modification of conditions of employment, etc.) against workers belonging to the ATE in the INDEC.
.Regarding the investigation into the allegations of the intervention and violent repression by the federal police of Argentina aimed at preventing the installation of a protest stand outside the INDEC entrance on  August , the Committee notes the INDEC statement that is has no jurisdiction to account for the action of the infantry forces of the federal police of Argentina. It further notes the Governments indication that in order to provide information on this issue it will conduct consultations with the relevant actors. The Committee expects to receive the information referred to by the Government.
.As regards the allegations of break-ins into the ATE trade union office in the INDEC main building on  May and  July  (according to the ATE, during the last attack, damage was caused to the office), the Committee notes the INDECs indication that these statements have prompted the opening of an administrative proceeding, which resulted in no disciplinary liability being imposed on any agent of the State. The Committee notes this information.
.As regards the court proceedings against the ATE delegate Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte for defrauding the public administration and free access by the delegate to the ATE trade union office in the INDEC, the Committee takes note of the information provided by the INDEC to the effect that: () the court proceedings are still in progress before Criminal and Correctional Court No. ; and () Mr Belforte freely enters the central headquarters of the Institute on a daily basis and was in office as a trade union delegate until October . In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final result of the court proceedings against the ATE delegate, Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte.
.As regards the judicial decisions that allegedly ordered the reinstatement of the trade union official Ms Liliana Haydee Gasco, and the worker Ms Vanina Micello, with which the Committee had requested the Government to ensure compliance should this be the case, the Committee notes with interest that the INDEC indicates that the workers in question are currently working in the CPI Department pursuant to the court order to that effect.
.As regards the alleged transfer of workplace of ATE member Mr Emilio Platzer, the Committee takes note of the INDECs statement to the effect that: () the worker in question performed tasks in the Institute under service provider contracts; () the last of these contracts ended in July  and since then, Mr Platzer no longer works in the INDEC; and () he was thus not transferred, but left at the end of his contract. The Committee takes note of this information and will not pursue the examination of this allegation, unless the complainant organization transmits additional information in this regard.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of ATE member Ms Gabriela Soroka, the Committee takes note of the INDECs statement to the effect that: () the worker was in a contractual relationship with the Institute under a cooperation agreement concluded between the INDEC and the Government of the city of Buenos Aires; and () her employment relationship came to an end in November , not as a result of dismissal but because her contract had ended. The Committee takes note of this information and will not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.As regards the alleged removal from her post of ATE delegate Ms Cynthia Pok, the Committee takes note of the INDECs statement to the effect that the worker in question has not been removed from her post and is still a trade union delegate, an office which she took up in the exercise of her trade union rights. In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of  workers from the CPI and EPH Department on November  for having participated in meetings and direct action organized by the trade union, the Committee takes note of the INDECs statement to the effect that the information provided by the complainant organization is false or incorrect and that the names of the workers in question are not mentioned, making it impossible to supply information on their current employment situation. In this regard, the Committee requests the CTA to send without delay the names of the workers who were allegedly dismissed so as to enable the Government to send concrete information on these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	With regard to the allegations relating to the intervention and violent repression by the Argentine federal police to prevent the installation of a protest stand at the INDEC entrance on  August , the Committee expects to receive the information referred to by the Government.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final result of the court proceedings against the ATE delegate Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte.(c)	As regards the alleged dismissal of  workers from the CPI and EPH Department on  November  for having participated in meetings and direct action organized by the trade union, the Committee requests the CTA to send without delay the names of the workers who were allegedly dismissed so as to enable the Government to send concrete information on these allegations.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) dated November .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers?Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of November , the CTA states that it is presenting this complaint against the Argentine State for multiple violations of freedom of association and the rights of workers?organizations and representatives guaranteed under Conventions Nos ,  and  and Recommendation No. , in the form of acts of discrimination, dismissals of trade union leaders, delegates and activists.
.The CTA indicates that the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC) is a public body, under the Ministry of Economy. According to the information set out on the official website of the institution, it is a technical body responsible for standardizing the direction and exercising overall management of all official statistical activities carried out in the territory of the Argentine Republic. Its creation and functioning are regulated by Act No. , Decree No. / and Decree No. /. The Act confers direct responsibility for the design of the methodology, organization and management of national operations for collecting data through censuses and surveys, the elaboration of basic social and economic indicators and the production of other basic statistics. INDEC is responsible for the development of the methodology and standardization of production of official statistics, thereby ensuring the comparability of information originating from different sources. Because it processes and produces statistics which reflect socio-economic situations of major importance, their periodic reports began to be sensitive?for the government authorities which, concerned at the",1,2009,Argentina
134,"impact that such reports could have on public opinion, initiated an aggressive policy of intervention in the Institute. Thus it ordered the replacement of professional technical staff by persons in sympathy with the political authorities who, controversially, made certain changes to the methodology and substituted survey data which resulted in data more in line with the public pronouncements of members of the Government. This was denounced by the workers and public opinion in general quickly noted the clumsy attempts at deception.
.The CTA adds that although it was in January  that the national Government ordered intervention in the INDEC, prior to that the situation was already not normal due to the fact that the then Director was pressured to disclose the names of the businesses surveyed (that being information protected by statistical confidentiality). The CTA alleges that from January , the disembarkation?began with the permanent and direct presence of the interveners and the persons reporting to them. From that time onwards, the result was manipulation of public statistics, harassment of workers and systematic destruction of the institution which has continued until this day. The intervention consisted basically of abolishing the Institutes chief function, which is to produce reliable and accessible statistics produced in a transparent manner in the framework of legal and methodological rules. The first operation subject to intervention was the Consumer Price Index (CPI). On  January , a new Director of the Institute was appointed by presidential decree.
.According to the CTA, the Secretary of Trade and the Director of INDEC said that the body needed to adapt to the policy set by the Government in accordance with its own needs. Thus, from that moment, data would not be published in order to align public policies with reality and the needs demonstrated by the information, but, on the contrary, the Institute would be turned into a political tool of the Government. This situation produced an immediate reaction from everyone, public opinion and the Institutes workers. That is how the collective dispute to save INDEC began. The CTA adds that, in consequence, and because the active opposition of the Institutes workers to the manipulation and deception promoted through the Institute constituted a serious obstacle, the Government launched an offensive against the workers and their representatives which took numerous forms. They began to harry and punish the Institutes workers through dismissals, reassignments, wage reductions, summary proceedings, discriminatory acts, actions in the courts and other forms of harassment, even to the extent of allowing or encouraging physical violence by third parties in INDECs sphere of operations.
.The CTA alleges the following violations of the right to organize.Physical violence against workers
.The CTA indicates that on  August , during the  day strike by INDEC workers in protest against the situation generated by the intervention and rejecting the reassignment of the Director of the Permanent Household Survey, the workers?assembly decided to erect a stand at the entrance to the INDEC building, as a trade union action to make society aware of the need to defend public statistics and the workers who opposed the manipulation. The violent intervention by the Federal Police of Argentina (PFA) prevented the stand being erected, and it was confiscated to prevent any possibility of erecting it. The workers were subjected to rough handling.
.The CTA adds that on  May , when a meeting of all the workers employed in the Ministry of Economy was called in the central hall of the Ministry, to present to the Minister , signatures in support of a claim for a wage increase of  pesos (ARS) through the reception desk, those present were brutally beaten by persons recognized to be members of a shock force which usually operated in INDEC. As a result of the attack, the assistant secretary of ATE-Capital, Luis Opromolla, was beaten and suffered various injuries, and two other workers from other parts of the Ministry were left bleeding and the worker, Cynthia Pok, was pushed violently to the ground. These attacks took place in the deliberate absence of the security personnel who normally work in the area and just after all the lights that usually illuminate the area went out. The complaints of threats and injuries are the subject of proceedings in Case No. /, instructing prosecutors office, office ; I--, instructing prosecutors office  and , correctional prosecutors office .Anti-trade union discrimination ?Persecution through judicial means
.The CTA indicates that there have now been numerous court cases in the dispute that has arisen in INDEC. Two of them are against delegates and workers who were prosecuted by the Institute for taking part in the dispute. These cases are: (a) Luciano Osvaldo Belforte, defrauding the public administration? Case No. /, Federal , office . This case concerns trade union delegates, Mr Belforte and Ms Graciela Bevacqua. The persecution by INDEC intervention was pursued in the criminal courts. In this case, INDEC intervention involved filing a complaint against these workers, alleging that they had committed fraud against the Institute. The charge was that the workers had fraudulently claimed holiday and overtime pay. The judge in the criminal court of first instance tried MrLuciano Belforte, ATEINDEC delegate, on the basis of a construction totally alien to the principles of criminal procedural law. On appeal by the accused, the National Criminal Appeal Court quashed the proceedings and upheld the workers, and also reprimanded the judge in the lower court which had accepted the allegations by the INDEC intervention. The Appeal Court quashed the proceeding. The Court emphasized that trial without evidence is a clear example of persecution; (b) Liliana Haydee Gasco v. State, Ministry of Economy and Production, summary proceeding, Case No. /. In September , INDEC intervention ordered that trade union delegate Liliana Gasco should not be given a desk, computer and telephone at the CPI office. This situation lasted for several months until, as a consequence of legal actions, Ms Gasco was assigned other tasks which were not appropriate to her function as special operations supervisor. The changes in the conditions of work imposed by the employer are expressly prohibited in the case of a trade union delegate or representative (article  of the Trade Unions Act, No. ). The safeguards for trade union activities set out in the Act were the legal arguments recognized in the judgments in favour of the trade union delegate, both in the lower court, Court No. , and the appeal court, Chamber III of the National Labour Court. The Court found that the reinstatement decided in the lower court should be implemented on the same conditions, in the same category and functions as those normally exercised by Ms Liliana Haydee Gasco prior to the change decided by her employer; (c) Vanina Micello v. State, Ministry of Economy and Production, National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC), Action for Amparo (protection), Case No. /. Here the presiding judge, Dr Gabriela Vzquez, supported by Judge Dr Luis Catardo in a majority judgment, stated that: On the basis of the material and evidence produced in the documents, I consider that it is proved that INDEC, through its officials, order the reassignment and change of work of staff member Vanina Micello as a reprisal for her exercise of trade union activities. I reach this conclusion, starting from a series of precise and consistent indications that show negative discrimination and, in addition, that the defendant did not show, regarding the burden of proof, that the reassignment was objectively and reasonably justified. In this context, the decision taken by the defendant to reassign Vanina Micello should be declared null and void and it is ordered that she be reinstated in the function that she performed prior to her reassignment.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The CTA also refers to the court case of Luciano Osvaldo Belforte, violation of domicile? Case No. , Criminal and Correctional Court No. , office . The employer issued an internal memorandum prohibiting the entry of delegate Belforte to the workplace. Apart from the fact that this legal measure was appealed in the labour courts, the delegate could enter the building as that was the location of the trade union office and he is a member of the internal council. On these grounds, the employer initiated criminal proceedings for violation of domicile? The case is still in process.Attacks on trade union premises
.The CTA alleges that on  May , the ATE trade union office on the tenth floor of the INDEC main building was attacked. The intruders overturned and scattered fittings, computers, furniture and documents. On  July , another even more violent attack occurred, as the intruders attacked and damaged the trade union office (the case is being heard as Case No. /, contraventional prosecutors office ).Intimidation through police and para-police presence
.The CTA indicates that in February , under the pretext peddled by the Institute intervention that it was a matter of security personnel acting as bodyguards to the new Director of the CPI section, the permanent presence of surveillance personnel was observed on the third floor of the building at",2,2009,Argentina
135," Roca Street, for the unmistakeable purpose of intimidating and controlling workers in the section. A logbook to record the names of workers entering and leaving the section was introduced for the same purpose.
.On  January , the internal walls (and sometimes the external walls also) of the Institute have been continuously covered with defamatory posters against the workers involved in the dispute, whether or not they are members of the Association of State Workers (ATE) internal council.
.On  January , representatives of human rights organizations sent a note to the National Human Rights Secretary expressing their concern at the challenge to trade union rights and workers?right to organize, the use of reprisals in relation to wages, intimidation of various kinds including a campaign of defamation launched from a website called INDEC que trabaja (INDEC at work).
.On  February , at the end of a meeting which had been called to inform about the situation in INDEC held at the entrance to the Institute, the entrance doors were closed to prevent those attending the meeting returning to their workplace. (A complaint of prohibition of entry to work was filed, Case No. , correctional prosecutors office , office .)Reprisals for trade union activity ?Changes to conditions of work
.On  April , Mr Emilio Platzer, an ATE member and one of the first to take legal action in the courts on grounds of manipulation and violation of state secrets, was removed from his workplace. In May , the CPI workers made a complaint about the situation in the sector. It was also raised in a general meeting of INDEC workers and received unanimous support. The complaint was published through the ATEINDEC email, as a result of which, the then Director of INDEC sought ratification or rectification of their statements under notice that appropriate administrative or judicial proceedings would be initiated. On  June , Gabriela Soroka, an ATE member and participant in the meetings, whose job was to monitor price information on food and drinks in the CPI, was dismissed.
.On  July , the Director of the Permanent Household Survey(EPH), Ms Cynthia Pok, together with  general coordinators, heads of department and senior technical staff, responsible for the same programme, each sent memos to INDEC management informing it in writing that they did not have the necessary technical conditions to carry out the poverty and extreme poverty calculation based on published facts relating to the CPI. On July , the management intervention ordered the reassignment of Ms Cynthia Pok from the management of the EPH. On  July , the workers declared an active strike in the whole of INDEC challenging the management decision to remove Ms Pok (ATE official). On the same day, the head of personnel administration summoned Ms Camila Morano and Ms Marta R. de Messere, of the EPH management team, to his office. They attended accompanied by ATEINDEC delegates. At that meeting, the head of personnel informed them that, at the suggestion of the INDEC management, they were invited?to take all their outstanding holidays ( and  days, respectively).
.On  July , the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security ordered compulsory conciliation, with the unusual feature that it only required the workers to lift the strike, but did not require the employer, as required by law, to suspend the removal of Ms Cynthia Pok. In consequence, the INDEC workers?meeting, with ATE representation, decided to continue the strike action. On the same day, with the clear intention of intimidating the workers to make them stop the direct action, the recently appointed National Director of Living Standards went to the EPH offices to speak with the staff involved in the strike action, and announced that he would be taking over Cynthia Poks office on the seventh floor, despite the fact that his department had a designated office on the second floor. He announced that his action was legal because he had an order from the President?
.On  July , the abovementioned Director telephoned Ms Marta Messere, MrRodolfoGalvn and Mr Leonardo Parodi (EPH technical staff) to come to his office individually, but they decided to refuse, as they were on strike. On the same day, the INDEC management began to send telegrams to the persons involved in the strike action indicating that they should return to work failing which their remuneration would be docked. On  July , the workers warned to return to work while they were on strike were summoned to make a statement in a hearing set for  August. They appeared at the hearing with the ATE lawyer. At the meeting, pressure was exerted on the technical staff to provide information so that other people could carry out the tasks of the strikers. A shot was fired at the INDEC reception desk on  August.
.On  August , the ATEINDEC delegates issued a communiqu warning public opinion of the irregular way in which public unemployment figures were prepared at that time by the intervention, a study which was not approved by the EPH technical team, on incomplete bases and without strict procedures. That same evening, the INDEC management published on the Internet a communiqu in which it falsely accused the EPH team of erasing data while at the same time admitting that it had intimidated striking workers to obtain information on the processing of data. Also on that day, the INDEC management published a notice indicating that it would make deductions from the strikers?remuneration. On  August , after a committee was set up to initiate dialogue and the strike had been lifted, the EPH section researchers who resumed their duties reported for work in the new Carlos Calvo building. However, they were refused entry and at the same time were told that they should report to the Roca building and sign in. At the Roca building, the personnel director received them and told them that an additional  people were being recruited to carry out their tasks, that they would be trained and should take note that there would then be a surplus of survey personnel.
.On  September , part of the staff who did not take part in the strike at all or only partially, and the new workers were rewarded with additional remuneration or bonus. Those persons had been rewarded because they were contracted and collaborated with the INDEC management to carry out the work of colleagues who were on strike. On September , ten working days after the lifting of the strikes, the strikers had still not received the computer codes, which meant that they could not enter the database and, consequently, could not actually resume their work.
.On  September , it became known that a new contingent of possible EPH researchers was being trained in the Carlos Calvo building in Greater Buenos Aires. The intervention, with the support of another trade union, was beginning to incorporate new personnel, in order to intimidate those who had taken part in the strike, with training courses given by people without any experience.
.The CTA indicates that on  November ,  workers in the CPI and EPH Department were dismissed. All those dismissed had participated in meetings and direct action promoted by the trade union, as well as giving testimony in the case before Federal Judge Canicobra Corral. On  November , a document was signed in the INDEC dispute monitoring committee between the Office of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Economy and Production and the ATE, in which it was provided that: the  dismissed persons shall be immediately recruited in the Secretariat of Political Economy of the Ministry of Economy? However, despite that formal obligation, it has not so far been fulfilled.
.In October , the deputy coordinator of the Economic Groups Survey, Ms Adela Zaltzman, a member of the ATE internal council, was removed from her duties.Impediments and obstacles to the exercise and development of trade union activity
.The ATE indicates that, in addition to the brief summary set out above, other matters have habitually occurred and continued over time, either as reprisals for or to inhibit trade union activity. Among these, particular mention should be made of the permanent and active presence of the shock group installed under the intervention (the current management) before and during meetings and in any other trade union activity carried out by workers, both within the organization or outside.
.Likewise, and with a clear intention to intimidate, trade union activities or any similar activity are monitored through filming and sound recordings which record their conduct, and the police and shock groups mentioned above even have surveillance systems to monitor these activities.
.Similarly, any materials relating to trade union action disseminated within the buildings are systematically removed immediately by the cleaning staff, in accordance with the managements instructions. On the other hand, notices of other unions, political groups, official intervention notices and even anonymous posters (mostly containing defamatory messages against this trade union and its members) are not removed from the walls. For its part, for several months, mass",-1,2009,Argentina
136,"distribution of trade union emails to all INDEC personnel were barred by the intervention of management or, failing that, the trade union was required to inform the authorities of the content in advance, a clear situation of censorship and restriction of freedom of expression. It should be emphasized that the intervention did not treat other trade unions in the same way.
.Lastly, the CTA states that the facts reported here are in addition to the constant violations of freedom of association which are recurrent in Argentina, many of which have been duly reported to the Committee on Freedom of Association and the subject of reproach by that Committee. These systematic violations are possible thanks to the reluctance of the Argentine State to align domestic law with the minimum standards of freedom of association set out in ILO Conventions Nos  and  and the prolific doctrine enshrined in the opinions of its supervisory bodies. Finally, it should be borne in mind that, with regard to public employees, Article  of ILO Convention No. , adopted in Geneva in , extends the right to organize and protection against any acts of anti-union discrimination in their employment to all public employees.
.In its communication of  February , the Government sent the report prepared by the INDEC). It is stated in the report that it was prepared following the layout proposed by the complainants, both with regard to the facts, acts, circumstances or rules relating to INDECs actions. INDEC indicates that the CTAs representatives open their complaint by stating that there is intervention?at two levels: a general level concerning the Institute as a whole and a particular level in the CPI Department within INDEC. It is suggested that these allegations, reproduced by the press on various occasions, are not supported in law or in fact, as described in detail below: (i) lack of legal justification: the supposed intervention is not possible under the Argentine legal system. The National Constitution which governs the powers of the executive authority with regard to interventions relates to other matters than those referred to above. Neither does the complaint refer to any administrative act issued by the executive authority or any other body with delegated powers, which constitutes administrative intervention. It is categorically asserted that there is no administrative act, decree or similar act which ordered any type of intervention, appointed persons to intervene or which justified any irregularities of any kind in the appointment of any official. In addition, it should be noted that it was under a legitimate administrative act (Decree PEN /) issued in accordance with recognized constitutional and legal powers, that Ms Ana Mara Edwin took up the post of Director of INDEC, harmoniously, in succession, without interregnums, as soon as the previous incumbent resigned her functions (resolution No. / of the Ministry of Economy). All the preceding directors of the organization were appointed in the same way; (ii)absence of facts: leaving aside the legal aspect, with regard to the facts that, according to the CTA representatives, constitute supposed intervention? at a general level, INDEC states emphatically that it has no knowledge of and does not possess any records or documentation in support of the versions that the government authorities initiated an aggressive policy of intervention by the Institute? (iii) it is important to emphasize that, as will emerge from this report of the facts, many staff of the organization had to deal with various problems in implementing the constitutional and legal mandate entrusted to them, due to incorrect interpretations of the reality, which is fully consistent with the law. It is reiterated, therefore, that it is wholly malicious for the complainant organization to label the current management of the Institute as intervention? The officials who exercise senior management roles, like the rest of the staff, were appointed in strict compliance with the rules governing this type of subject throughout Argentina. The assertion that INDEC became subordinate to the Secretary of Internal Trade in January  is categorically refuted. The authorities were subordinate and are currently subordinate to the Secretariat of Political Economy and the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance, respectively.
.With regard to the general assertions by the CTA concerning the specific intervention in the CPI Department, INDEC refers, in the first instance, to Decree PEN/ which appointed Ms Beatriz Paglieri, and the rules and resolutions cited therein, as complete evidence that the complainants allegations are wrong. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the appointment was made in accordance with due administrative procedure, like all appointments in the national public service, and is validated constitutionally and legally in the NEP. Like all posts which are not subject to competition, the appointment was on a provisional basis as an exception to the provisions of article  of Act No.  and Title III, chapter III and Title IV, article , paragraph, part , of Annex I to Decree No./, amended . The public offices held by the official in question are detailed below. As a result of her extensive professional experience and qualification, the former Minister of Economy and Production appointed her in January  to INDEC to analyse, on her behalf, the working processes by which the Institute calculated price indexes. It was indicated that, in principle, she would start by analysing the consistency of what is commonly known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI)? On this basis, she was appointed in February , by Order No. , to the post of Director of the CPI Department in INDEC. INDEC considers that it is extremely damaging that she has been presented to the ILO as an unqualified professional lacking the minimum knowledge necessary to occupy the post to which she was appointed.
.According to INDEC, the state of the CPI Department when Ms Beatriz Paglieri took up her post was not remotely like that described by the CTA. It presented a highly distorted view of the state of the art?of the CPI Department prior to the start of her management. With undoubted malicious intent, since the distortions of the reality are too great to assume that they are simply the fruit of an error of judgment, it was sought to mislead the Committee, indicating that the CPI management was a paradise of work, dedication, quality and scientific rigour.
.According to INDEC, the situation in the area which calculates the CPI in INDEC is very different from the one portrayed, both in these proceedings and through the various media to which the complainants resorted, by those who took advantage of the laxity in the procedures and controls that existed and who were then negatively affected by the greater demands on them in the new ways of working. It is also necessary to emphasize that given the implications which occasioned the development model, especially with regard to the public accounts, the situation described would have lasted for a long time. Taking full responsibility for the harm generated to the population by the application of incorrect methods, steps were taken with skill, speed and efficiency to evaluate the situation and determine the veracity of the information that was being produced. Against this background, the first fundamental element which strikes any observer is that the CPI management did not coordinate actions with the ministries, secretariats of State, or the bodies which make up the National Statistical System (SEN) as determined by Act No. and its regulatory decree. INDEC, as clearly laid down by law, is the coordinator?of the SEN and it is obvious that it cannot coordinate what it does not interact with. Furthermore, the CPI management was not fulfilling the functions set out in resolution No./ (pursuant to the Ministries Act) with regard to actions to update the weightings for the CPI. In the same vein, it was observed that the management did not apply strictly the methodology using the CPI base = to determine the CPI and that it used the Argentine Central Bank to calculate the Reference Stabilization Coefficient (CER)?which is used, ultimately, as an adjusting factor for Argentine external debt bonds. This means that an error, deliberate or otherwise, which adds a unit to the total of the CPI calculation would modify the assets of bondholders. In addition, the so-called methodology ?consisting of the instructions set out in resolution No. /, determines the need to update the weightings of the products which make up the CPI. In this regard, it is important to recall that the Quality Management Manual for the elaboration of the National Consumer Price Index and the National Producer Price Index?of the Bank of Mexico indicates the frequency with which the index is updated and the principles guiding its action.
.In turn, it was found that there was no manual of procedures or good practices for the calculation of the CPI. Nor were the various manuals for researchers, supervisors or data collectors which should guide the field operations updated. The staff assigned to each task did not comply with the provisions of the relevant Manual. The calculation base was the year , with",0,2009,Argentina
137,"weightings that dated from the  Household Expenditure Survey (ENGH), and informant sources were based on sales volumes defined in the  National Economic Census. INDEC sends examples of problems of measurement that occurred previously.
.INDEC indicates that having found irregularities, and following instructions from the highest national authority, the matter was reported by Beatriz Paglieri to the Notary General of the Government, through his representative at INDEC headquarters, who drew up the report on the basis of which the notary advised that there was evidence?of errors in the report submitted by Marcela Almeida and Emilio Platzer. This unprecedented matter generated a marked animosity towards the official in certain management circles, as it was the first time that a flagrant misrepresentation had been documented. It is worth emphasizing that out of some  employees who make up the staff of the CPI management, only  were determined to harass and/or boycott the new management. It is very important to emphasize the excellent predisposition presented by the great majority who made up and continue to make up the CPI team which allowed the CPI to be produced on time and in due form. It is no surprise that some of the complaints come from persons who made the mistakes?reported to the Notary General.
.INDEC states, in the course of extensive technical explanations, that many of those responsible for the institutional errors in the production of data up to  went on to form the internal council of ATEINDEC, which provided them with protection in situations when they should have been subject to summary administrative proceedings under the legislation applicable to the national public administration. This defensive conduct was concomitant with all kinds of statements in the media designed to seriously undermine the prestige of the institution, and to generate confusion among the public.
.According to INDEC, this behaviour was aggravated by a different type of disorder generated both within and outside the Institute, including travel within and outside the country, all aimed at achieving a public position contrary to the official statistics. Worth mentioning in this regard is the false information concerning the reassignment of duties which were never held. Such is the case of Ms Cynthia Pok, self-styled Director of the EPH when there was only an internal arrangement, a rule of the Institute of little legal import, which put her in sole charge of the office of that department. To be in charge of an office involves administering permits relating to staff (absences, holidays, etc.) and responsibility only for work related to office procedures. This function excludes the technical management of a department. The Director of this survey was MsClyde Trabucchi, who was actually appointed to the post in an open competition in , an appointment which expired in  and was extended without competition. She was never insolvent or appointed by presidential order as national director for living standards. As in the previous case, she was put in charge of the office of that national department. It is evident that the CTA and Ms Cynthia Pok herself are falsely purporting that she holds public office, a criminal offence under national legislation. In the same vein, cases can be mentioned such as that of Mr Luciano Belforte, who was never head of CPI data collection since there is no such post, or Ms Marcela Almeida, who is said to have been removed from the coordination of the National Consumer Price Index section, a post which does not exist. Moreover, Ms Almeida is not even an INDEC staff member. On the contrary, she was and is contracted by the Government of Buenos Aires City, under a cooperation agreement.
.INDEC indicates that Ms Paglieri was the victim of an assault by Mr Emilio Platzer on October . When she was in the INDEC building and guarded by two federal police officers, Ms Paglieri was violently pushed by Mr Platzer. It led to the sending of a note to the INDEC management by the Ministry of the Interior, requesting consideration be given to the possibility of imposing a sanction. Finally, and following an instruction on the matter by the Legal Affairs Department, the management decided not to renew his contract with the institution, on the grounds of his failure to observe the standards expected of those who work in the national public administration. INDEC considers that it is particularly relevant to mention these facts and dispositions with respect to the characterization of the conduct of certain members of the ATEINDEC union who, like Mr Platzer, had no hesitation in resorting to aggression as a result of their animosity against INDEC staff, which had nothing to do with trade union actions. It is important to emphasize that MrPlatzer was no longer working in the CPI Department because he made unacceptable mistakes.
.INDEC indicates in relation to the alleged replacement of professional technical staff by persons related to the political authorities that primarily, as stated above, the INDEC authorities were appointed by the executive authority under the legislation applicable in the Republic of Argentina.
.INDEC indicates that the theory that the CTA expresses in its statement and on which it bases an account concerning the unlawfulness of the presence and work of certain?INDEC staff is incorrect and tendentious. It is incorrect in that it would be nonsense to think that the supposed intervention?occurred through, for example, the appointment of a new director for the CPI. The reason for the erroneous character is simple: as in any organization, private or public enterprise, there are changes of post which do not reflect any type of intervention? but a renewal of personnel in the hierarchy involving a systematic reorganization. This is a far cry from the supposed destruction?conjectured by the complainant. It is tendentious because it affirms what it seeks to prove, namely, that INDEC is in a state of exception and instability, which the Government was exploiting. The action of the Association of State Workers, ATEINDEC, accompanied by the homogeneous statements of the media companies, was the only indication, a false one, of a supposed state of exception which, bluntly, does not exist. In fact, these assertions show the desire of the trade union or its representatives to project their influence into matters which are beyond their competence. The Argentine legal system does not contain a constitutional or legal right of an individual, trade union or prospective worker which grants them powers of control of any type over the appointment of the officials whose legitimate presence they are challenging.
.As regards the alleged physical violence against the workers on  August , INDEC indicates that in a biased and false description of the facts, the complainant states: during the  day strike by INDEC workers in protest against the situation generated by the management? In this respect, we must inform you that INDEC has a total of ,workers. Of those, during August , according to the attendance sheets provided by the Human Resources Department,  workers took part in the strike, representing per cent of the total workforce. In addition, only one took part in the strike for ten days, one for eight days, one for five days, six for three days,  for two days and  for only one day. It thus clearly emerges that the complainant is not telling the truth when it states that there was a strike of  days. It is also lying when it speaks in general terms of the INDEC workers? as  per cent of the workers never took part in the strike in the period mentioned in its complaint, and of the  workers who joined the strike,  did so for only one day, as mentioned, thus it may be wondered whether this group can be adjudged representative of INDEC workers in general. Furthermore, the total number of ATEINDEC members is  out of a total of , workers.
.The complainant also infers the occurrence of a violent?intervention by the Argentine Federal Police (PFA) preventing the erection of a stand at the entrance to the INDEC building. On this point, by way of preliminary explanation, it should be noted that certain spaces in the Federal Capital are under the jurisdiction of the PFA and that INDEC has no control over the conduct of the PFA or any hierarchical link with it, for obvious reasons of competence. With respect to the facts, we can report that on that date, various persons were observed provoking the security forces, preventing access to the building and causing damage. Of the rough handling? there is no real, judicial or administrative evidence whatsoever.
.As regards the existence of three court cases, Nos /, I-- and , all for various injuries, in which the deputy secretary of ATE-Capital, Luis Opromolla, two workers of other areas of the Ministry of Economy (not identified) and Ms Cynthia Pok, all members of ATEINDEC, were injured, it should be mentioned in relation to the first two cases that these were a single case, namely, No. . The proceedings in question were initiated on the basis",2,2009,Argentina
138,"of a complaint stating that in circumstances where Mr Luis Alberto Opromolla, together with other ATE members, were preparing to start a meeting in the main hall of the building, delegates of the UPCN union appeared, among them the accused, MrSilverio Rafael Figueredo, who suddenly punched Mr Opromolla in the face. In this respect, the court judgment of  April put an end to the proceedings. In the hearing, it was stated that as there was no possibility of carrying out any investigation of the evidence to shed light on the charge against Mr Silverio Rafael Figueredo, to order the case to continue in those circumstances would be an unnecessary and pointless legal expense because of the lack of certainty, from the point of view of legal evidence, represented by the lack of grounds for conviction in the complaint ?it is resolved to dismiss the case against the accused of causing bodily harm, and render harmless his good name and honour? With respect to the third case mentioned, No. , a different analysis applies but of no less importance. Initiated for the offence of menaces, to which Ms Laura Mara Cortascini Chisari was supposedly subjected, the accused, Mr Daniel Roberto Poma, was acquitted on September , as it was found that the criminal action was time-barred. Specifically, it was a supposed offence in which proceedings were abandoned because they were contrary to the principle of innocence and double jeopardy, a general guarantee of persons in criminal proceedings.
.With regard to the case of Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte, defrauding the public administration, Case No. /, INDEC indicates that proceedings were taken against MrLuciano Osvaldo Belforte for receiving his salary with additional remuneration in the months of November  and December , when in reality he was away travelling without the authorization of the relevant INDEC authorities and proceedings were also taken against Ms Graciela Cristina Bevacqua for certifying Mr Belfortes signatures on the attendance sheets. The complainant, using the expression pronouncements?as if it were a final decision, summarizes by stating that the appeal court quashed the proceedings in favour of the accused. In this regard, and in total contradiction, on  August  it was decided to order the trial of Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte, who was granted bail, because he was suspected of the criminal offence of defrauding the public administration on two occasions, and an order was made to freeze his assets to cover the amount of ARS,. The case against Ms Graciela Cristina Bevacqua was dismissed. That is the actual state of proceedings.
.With regard to the trial of Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte for violation of domicile, INDEC indicates that the case against the accused was dropped. INDEC recalls that the applicable legislation imposes on its employees the duty to report to their superior or the relevant authorities, acts of which they become aware as a result of or in the course of the exercise of their functions and which could cause harm to the State or constitute an offence.
.With respect to the alleged violence against the trade union offices, INDEC states that with regard to the facts that supposedly occurred on  May , it is a matter of an unsubstantiated account since it lacks any elements to confirm the alleged facts or circumstances. As regards the events which occurred on  July , the proceedings in question were initiated on the basis of a complaint against Mr Silverio Rafael Figueredo for allegedly committing the offence of criminal damage as a result of his alleged invasion of offices  and  in the building at  Roca Street, Case No. /. On November , the court dismissed the case, on the grounds that there was no evidence that would lead to a conviction in the case.
.With regard to the alleged intimidation through the presence of police and para-police officers in February , we can report that the introduction of surveillance personnel in certain sections of INDEC is part of a progressive effort to ensure the complete protection of staff. Concerning the registration log, this is a means of helping to ensure security since, if there is an incident involving the personnel working in the area, the log can be used to determine which persons entered or left and at what time they did so. Indeed, currently and for some time, for entry to various INDEC buildings, there is a magnetic card which distinguishes between an INDEC staff member and a visitor, as has always been used in the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance. It should be noted that the CTA refers to the presence of security personnel in INDEC both as a form of intimidation and, on the other hand, complains that their absence is an element of insecurity for staff. Finally, INDEC denies that it uses para-police personnel of any kind in INDEC. Such allusions are made with the obvious intention of demeaning the activity of the Institute and its management.
.In relation to the alleged intimidation, concerning the supposed papering of internal and external walls with defamatory and unsigned posters against workers belonging to ATEINDEC, it should be noted that as soon as one enters the Institute, the political and trade union diversity of the building can be observed. Posters and notices, some even handwritten, with a variety of content can be seen on noticeboards and walls. There is no prior censorship of freedom of expression as there is full compliance with the constitutional rule on that point. Furthermore, the Institutes devotion to respect for rights has often led to excessive tolerance of libellous expressions by the ATEINDEC union.
.As regards the facts denounced on  February , Case No. , involving a complaint of alleged prohibition of entry to work, this is tendentiously invoked with respect to a stage in the proceedings which has already concluded. This case, subsequently referred to Court No. , office , Case No. /, was decided. The judgment quashed the actions since they did not constitute the acts in article  of the Criminal Code, i.e.,there was no coercion or violence of any kind, whether to take part in a strike or a lockout, since INDECs doors were simply closed.
.As regards the alleged reprisals for trade union activity and refusal of workers to consent to the manipulation of official data, and the modification of conditions of work, INDEC states, firstly, that this involves a wide diversity of facts which have certain general characteristics which deserve detailed investigation which is beyond the possibility and competence of the management. It could be mentioned, among other things, that it is not a case of specific claims or allegations which might substantiate any particular violation of rights; they are poorly documented and have few or no references to documents or records. Their diversity and quantity are such that it is extremely difficult, in some cases impossible, to collect relevant information concerning them. Such characteristics, of course, do not mean that they are of no concern to the management. However, addressing them in detail, given that they chiefly concern allegations of unproven facts, is not part of the main function of the organization. INDEC will continue as far as possible to deal with the individual claims of workers, always within the framework of what is established by law and guided by respect for human rights, individual rights and rights at work which under the Constitution and the law affect those who work for the organization or occasionally pass through it. Always within the limits of the possible, it is reported that the alleged failure to assign tasks to Ms Adela Zaltzman is a falsehood, since the post that she is supposed to occupy does not exist in the organization.
.As regards the alleged active and permanent presence of a shock group established by the management before and during meetings, INDEC states that the so-called shock groups?referred to by the complainant do not exist in INDEC. The reference to the existence of such groups can only be interpreted as the product of a cynical attitude or ignorance of Argentine history. These defamatory references have a very serious connotation and content linked to de facto regimes which governed the country. Workers?political and trade union rights and freedoms are assured within INDEC. The CTA also states: ?trade union activities or any similar activity are monitored through filming and sound recordings? INDEC states that no such control exists.
.As regards the CTAs assertion that all materials relating to trade union activity posted inside the organizations buildings are systematically removed, but communications of other trade unions containing defamatory messages against that trade union and its members are left, INDEC sends photographs of the interior of the INDEC main building, where the posters and flyers which the complainant freely distributes can be seen, together with the aggressive terms the CTA allows itself to use in relation to other trade union demonstrations.
.With regard to the allegation that for several months the ATE was prevented from sending trade union emails and email circulars to all INDEC personnel",1,2009,Argentina
139,"in a clear case of prior censorship and restriction of freedom of expression, INDEC states that all the organizations personnel have an email address, and the various trade unions send email circulars to all the staff on a daily basis. This system is part of the democratic policy which is promoted by the way the Institute is managed. Both the publicity material posted inside the building and the email circulars which ATEINDEC sends to all the staff, are typically offensive and insulting to the organization.
.INDEC states that the supposed violations of the rights and liberties mentioned in the complaint did not occur. Rather, the actions of a group of staff, who do not even represent all ATEINDEC members, interrupted certain aspects of the daily work, systematically putting at risk the fulfilment of the responsibilities deriving from the Ministries Act, No., and the applicable legislation which determines the actions and functions to be carried out by the organization and threatening the full exercise of individual and labour rights of the other workers and persons working in INDEC. The Legal Affairs Department is currently working and will work in the future to guarantee those rights, report and constantly take proceedings against those who violate the legal order and justice within INDEC. The presence of police and security staff in INDEC is purely and simply to ensure the security of people working in the organization, as is the practice in all public bodies. The right to liberty, security, protection against arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, as well as freedom of opinion and expression, the right to meet, to obtain due process in independent and impartial courts and protection of the property of trade unions are exercised respectively by the workers and officials of the institution.
.INDEC concludes that there were no violations of individual, trade union or labour rights and freedoms of persons who were normally or occasionally related to INDEC on the dates and at the places mentioned in the complaint. The mis-cited court decisions and the feeble complaints divorced from reality are compounded by the absence of facts, resulting in the painting of a picture which totally fails to substantiate the assertions made by the complainant concerning the supposed violations of rights in the institution. A final conclusion can be inferred from the complainants allegations, namely that it has repeatedly and to excess persisted with its attack on the institution and the management, mentioning terms such as intervention?on some  occasions and peddling falsehoods unsupported by any documentary evidence or arguments.
.The Committee observes that in this case, the complainant organization alleges acts of violence (intervention and violent repression by the PFA to prevent the erection of a protest stand at the entrance to INDEC on  August ; attacks on workers at the meeting of  May , causing various injuries to the deputy secretary of ATE-Capital, Mr Luis Opromolla and two other workers, and striking Ms Cynthia Pok), intimidation by means of police presence and prevention of the exercise of trade union activity, attack against a trade union office and anti-union discrimination (initiation of legal proceedings for participating in the dispute between the ATE and the INDEC authorities, reprisals and modification of conditions of employment, etc.) against workers belonging to the ATE.
.In the first place, the Committee observes that the complainant organization and the Government refer to questions of appointment of INDEC personnel and the functioning of the Institute on which, under its mandate, the Committee is not competent to pronounce. The Committee also observes that the Government sends a report by INDEC as its reply.Acts of violence and intimidation through police presence and obstacles to the exercise of trade union activity
.With regard to the allegations relating to the intervention and violent repression by the PFA to prevent the erection of a protest stand at the entrance to INDEC on  August , the Committee notes that the INDEC report sent by the Government states: ()certain spaces in the Federal Capital are under the jurisdiction of the PFA; () INDEC has no control over or hierarchical link with the PFA; () with respect to the alleged facts, various persons provoked the security forces, preventing access to the building and causing damage; and () of the rough handling? there is no real, judicial or administrative evidence. In this respect, the Committee regrets that the Government did not send detailed observations and confined itself to providing the point of view and information from INDEC. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an investigation is carried out without delay into the alleged acts of violence and that if it is found that the police overstepped the mark in the exercise of their functions, measures should be taken to remedy the situation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.
.With regard to the allegations of attacks on workers at a meeting of all the workers employed in the Ministry of Economy, which was held in the central hall of the Ministry to present to the Minister a claim for a wage increase on  May , causing various injuries to the deputy secretary of ATE-Capital Luis Opromolla and two other workers and blows suffered by Cynthia Pok, the Committee notes that the INDEC report sent by the Government states: () a judicial investigation was initiated on the basis of a complaint stating that in circumstances where Luis Alberto Opromolla, together with other ATE members, were preparing to start a meeting in the main hall of the building, delegates of the UPCN union appeared, and then Mr Silverio Rafael Figueredo punched MrOpromolla in the face; () the court proceedings were ended by a judgment of  April  and the accused was acquitted; and () another judicial investigation initiated into the offence of threats was concluded on  September , when it was found that the criminal action was time-barred.
.Observing that the acquittals mentioned by INDEC of the accused persons do not indicate that the alleged events did not occur, the Committee notes that the investigations failed to identify the perpetrators of the attacks against the trade union leader mentioned and the workers in question. The Committee recalls that the officials and workers belonging to the ATE in the Ministry of Economy or INDEC must be able to hold meetings without fear of attacks.
.As regards the allegations concerning intimidation through the police presence in INDEC in February  recording in a log workers entering and leaving, and the presence of groups of persons (shock groups, according to the CTA) which reported to the INDEC management before and during meetings or during any other trade union activity filming them and making sound recordings, the Committee notes that the INDEC report states that: () the introduction of surveillance personnel in certain sections of INDEC is part of a progressive effort to ensure the complete protection of staff; () the registration log is a means of helping to ensure security, since if there is an incident involving the personnel working in the area, the log can be used to determine which persons entered or left and at what time they did so; () currently for entry to various INDEC buildings, there is a magnetic card which distinguishes between an INDEC staff member and a visitor; () no para-police personnel or shock groups operate in INDEC and workers?political and trade union rights are assured. While noting the security reasons invoked, the Committee considers that workers?organizations should be able to hold meetings without intimidation and in conformity with the principles of freedom of association and requests the Government to ensure respect for these principles.
.As regards the alleged obstacles to the ATEs trade union activity in INDEC (impossibility of putting up posters in INDEC because they are removed by cleaning staff, and obstacles to the use of email) the Committee duly notes that INDEC reports that: () as soon as one enters the Institute, the political and trade union diversity of the building can be observed, and posters and notices, some even handwritten, with a variety of content can be seen on noticeboards and walls; () there is no prior censorship of freedom of expression and the complainant organization freely distributes posters, flyers and leaflets; () all the organizations personnel have an email address, and the various trade unions send email circulars to all the staff on a daily basis; and () both the publicity material posted inside the building and the email circulars which ATEINDEC sends to all the staff are typically offensive and insulting to the organization.
.As regards the alleged refusal by INDEC to allow entry to workers participating in a meeting which had been called to inform them of the situation in the Institute on February , the Committee notes that INDEC indicates that the criminal complaint initiated in this respect was dismissed.Violence against an ATEINDEC trade union office
.With regard to the allegations of attacks against the ATE trade union office in the INDEC main building on ",-1,2009,Argentina
140,"May and  July  (according to the CTA, during the last attack damage was caused to the office) the Committee notes that INDEC indicates that in relation to the alleged attack on  May, this is an unsubstantiated account since it lacks any elements to confirm the alleged facts or circumstances and, in relation to the alleged attack on  July , judicial proceedings were initiated on the basis of a complaint against Mr Silverio Rafael Figueredo for allegedly committing the offence of criminal damage and, on  November , the court dismissed the case, on the grounds that there was no evidence that would lead to a conviction in the case. The Committee observes that the lack of conviction of a person accused as the perpetrator of the alleged acts of violence does not indicate that the alleged events did not occur. In these circumstances, noting that the Government has only provided the observations of INDEC in this regard, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that an investigation is carried out into these allegations and to keep it informed of the outcome of this investigation.Acts of anti-union discrimination (initiation of legal proceedings for participating in the dispute, reprisals and modification of conditions of employment, dismissal and threats of dismissal, etc.) and reprisals against workers affiliated to the ATE in INDEC for participating in a strike
.With regard to the initiation of two criminal proceedings against the ATE trade union delegate, Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte (one for defrauding the public administration in where, according to the complainant, the trial was quashed on appeal and it was indicated to the judge of first instance that the proceedings without evidence constituted a clear example of persecution; and the other for violation of domicile which is still in progress, which was initiated because the delegate entered the trade union office as he was a member of the internal council and his entry had been prohibited), the Committee notes that INDEC states that: () in relation to the proceedings for defrauding the public administration, proceedings were taken against Mr Belforte for receiving his salary with additional remuneration in November  and December , while being on trips not authorized by the INDEC authorities and, in total contradiction to the complainants assertion, on  August  it was decided to order his trial without remand because he was suspected of having committed the alleged offence, and an order was made to freeze his assets; and () with regard to the trial for violation of domicile, Mr Belforte was acquitted and the applicable legislation imposes on the INDEC management the duty to report acts of which they become aware which could cause harm to the State or constitute an offence. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final result of the court proceedings against the ATE delegate, Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte, for defrauding the public administration. The Committee also requests the Government to inform it whether the delegate in question can freely enter the ATE trade union office in INDEC.
.As regards the legal proceedings for modification of conditions of work by INDEC initiated by the trade union official, Ms Liliana Haydee Gasco, (the complainant states that both at first and second instance, the judicial authority decided that Ms Gasco should be reinstated in the conditions, category and identical functions as she normally and habitually held prior to the modification decided by the employer) and by the worker MsVanina Micello (the complainant organization indicates that the judicial authority considered that it was proved her transfer and the change of work was a reprisal for the exercise of trade union activities and ordered that she should be reinstated in her functions), the Committee observes that the Government has not communicated its observations in this respect. In these circumstances, given that, according to the information supplied by the complainant organization, the judicial decisions ordered the reinstatement in their functions of the trade union official, Ms Liliana Haydee Gasco, and the worker, Ms Vanina Micello, the Committee requests the Government, should this be the case, to ensure compliance with the relevant judicial decisions and to keep it informed in this regard.
.As regards the numerous alleged acts of anti-union discrimination (transfer of workplace of the ATE member Mr Emilio Platzer; the dismissal of ATE member, Ms Gabriela Soroka; and the removal from her post of ATE delegate, Ms Cynthia Pok) and intimidation and reprisals against ATE members for participating in a strike in protest against the removal of Ms Cynthia Pok from her post and for participating in ATE meetings (in particular it is alleged that  workers were dismissed from the CPI and EPH Department on November , that, although there was an order for her immediate recruitment, to date it had not been fulfilled, and that ATE delegates are currently not recognized) the Committee notes that INDEC states that: () this involves a wide diversity of facts which have certain general characteristics which deserve detailed investigation which is beyond the possibility and competence of the INDEC management; () it is not a case of specific claims or allegations which might substantiate any particular violation of rights and their diversity and quantity are such that it is extremely difficult to collect relevant information; () efforts will continue to deal with the individual claims of workers; and () it denies the alleged failure to assign tasks to Ms Adela Zaltzman and indicates that the post that she is supposed to occupy does not exist in the organization. In this respect, the Committee urges the Government to send without delay its detailed observations relating to the following allegations: () the transfer of workplace of ATE member, Mr Emilio Platzer; () the dismissal of ATE member, Ms Gabriela Soroka; () the removal from her post of ATE delegate, Ms Cynthia Pok; and () the dismissal of workers from the CPI and EPH Department on  November .
.Lastly, the Committee observes with concern the content of the allegations presented in this complaint which refer to acts of violence and discrimination against trade unionists and attacks on a trade union office which suggest a climate of confrontation between the ATE union (affiliated to the CTA) and the INDEC authorities. In these circumstances, the Committee invites the Government, with a view to achieving harmonious labour relations in the organization, to set up a forum for dialogue in which, among other things, the questions raised in this complaint can be dealt with.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an investigation is carried out without delay into the allegations relating to the intervention and violent repression by the PFA to prevent the erection of a protest stand at the INDEC entrance on  August  and that if it is found that the police overstepped the mark in the exercise of their functions, to take measures to remedy the situation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(b) With regard to the allegations of attacks against the ATE trade union office in the INDEC main building on  May and  July  (according to the ATE, during the last attack damage was caused to the office), the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that an investigation is carried out into these allegations and to keep it informed of its outcome.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final result of the court proceedings against the ATE delegate, Mr Luciano Osvaldo Belforte, for defrauding the public administration. The Committee also requests the Government to inform it whether the delegate in question can freely enter the ATE trade union office in INDEC.(d) Given that, according to the information supplied by the complainant organization, the judicial decisions ordered the reinstatement in their functions of the trade union official, MsLiliana Haydee Gasco, and the worker Vanina Micello, the Committee requests the Government, should this be the case, to ensure compliance with the relevant judicial decisions and to keep it informed in this regard.(e) The Committee urges the Government to send without delay its detailed observations relating to the following allegations: () the transfer of workplace of ATE member, Mr Emilio Platzer; () the dismissal of ATE member, Ms Gabriela Soroka; () the removal from her post of ATE delegate, Ms Cynthia Pok; and () the dismissal of  workers from the CPI and EPH Department on November .(f) The Committee invites the Government, with a view to achieving harmonious labour relations in the organization, to set up a forum for dialogue in which, among other things, the questions raised in this complaint can be dealt with.",1,2009,Argentina
141,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) dated August .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated November , June, August and  November .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of August , the CTA states that the present complaint is being brought against the Government of Argentina for multiple violations of freedom of association and the rights of workers?organizations and representatives, as guaranteed by Conventions Nos ,  and  and Recommendation No. , committed in the form of acts of discrimination and dismissals of trade union leaders, delegates and activists. The CTA points out that the case covered by the present complaint is just one of many in which the rights of workers and their organizations have been violated. The CTA notes with concern the systematic repetition of practices harmful to freedom of association. Consequently, the present complaint is being brought against the Government of Argentina for failure to guarantee the exercise of the rights of members, officials and delegates of unions, whether already registered or applying for registration, because they do not belong to unions which enjoy legal recognition.
.The CTA alleges that the Government, which has been reluctant to adapt national law to the minimum standards of freedom of association established by ILO Conventions Nos  and  and the extensive doctrine originating from the opinions of its supervisory bodies, gave rise by omission to the acts of anti-union discrimination and conduct against Mr Jos Vicente Leiva, representative of the CTA and founder of a union.
.The CTA states that the Barrick Gold Corporation is the biggest gold-mining multinational in the world, with its headquarters in Toronto. It has more than  mines operating in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Peru, United Republic of Tanzania, and United States. In , the company merged with Homestake and thus established its presence in Argentina, which was marked by the acquisition of Veladero in San Juan province. Apart from the current operations and projects, South America is a strategic area for the future growth of the company.
.The CTA states that Mr Jos Leiva is a worker with many years of service in the company who, in addition to demonstrating leadership qualities and engaging in union activism, is a member of the executive committee of the Argentine Miners?Union (OSMACTA), whose application for registration as a union is currently being processed by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, file No. . Veladero employs more than , persons, of which  are permanent staff while the rest are subjected to various forms of labour malpractice through the subcontracting of services. The work at the mine face, currently at an altitude of , metres, is carried out under appalling conditions (in winter temperatures fall below minus C). As a result of the lack of oxygen and the dust raised by the excavations, the air is full of silica particles, which lodge in the lungs and cause the incurable disease of silicosis. The lack of oxygen is also damaging inasmuch as it causes serious circulatory problems, which lead to heart disease and neurological disorders.
.Even under these working conditions the workers are not provided with suitable medication or preventive medical treatment, let alone special clothing to provide protection against the low temperatures of the high mountains. The monthly work schedule is days?work followed by  days?leave. Daily working time exceeds  hours, calculated from arrival at the mine gallery entrance. To this must be added another two hours for travel to and from the hotel in which the workers stay while employed at the mine. The food provided both at the workplace and later at the lodgings is inadequate in view of the physically demanding nature of the work and the prevailing climatic conditions at high altitude.
.One year ago, the workers conducted a work stoppage in protest against the death of twoworkers in the mountains. When the death of the two workers was confirmed, an immediate search for the bodies was launched, against a background of shock that the deaths were certainly the result of non-existent safety measures and inappropriate working conditions for mining. The body of Mr Muoz Leonardo was found but there were obstacles to recovering the body of Mr Aguilera Mauricio. The company therefore sent a representative, who held a meeting with the workers and ordered them to call off the search and resume work immediately, since the stoppage was causing the mine to lose revenue. The outrage that this provoked resulted in Mr Jos Vicente Leiva informing the representative of the multinational on behalf of the workers that nobody would return to work until the missing body was found.
.The CTA states that because of the loss of purchasing power and the companys refusal to award a pay rise on the pretext that negotiations were being held with the AOMA, a meeting was convened in  and it was decided to take vigorous action in the form of a strike with the downing of tools and pickets posted near the mine entrance. The strike lasted  hours. These events precipitated the need to form a new type of trade union in view of the lack of response from the branch trade union.
.Given the lack of response to the abovementioned complaints regarding working conditions, the workers decided to organize and form the Argentine Miners?Union (OSMA), with Mr Jos Vicente Leiva the focal point for the workers. More than workers met in various groups to decide on the structure of the union, which was finally established on  June  with Mr Jos Vicente Leiva appointed as general secretary. At the same assembly the workers decided to affiliate to the CTA.
.The CTA alleges that at the same time that the certification of the constituent documents in the presence of a notary was taking place, on  July , the company, having learned of the establishment of the OSMACTA, ordered the wrongful dismissal of Mr Jos Vicente Leiva on account of his status as focal point in the conflict at the mine and his election as general secretary of the new union. The company, violating the principle of trade union autonomy and its obligation of non-interference, was proactive in imposing a different representative body on the union from the one that had been elected.
.According to the CTA, it is clear that the grounds for the dismissal of union leader Mr Jos Vicente Leiva were his union activity and his constant demands for improved working conditions, as well as the establishment of the Argentine Miners?Union. This is also a clear abuse of power designed to have a disciplinary and inhibitory effect on the exercise of collective rights by all the workers and constitutes a discriminatory dismissal prohibited by law.
.On  August, in relation to the conduct of the company, representatives of the CTA held a joint press conference with Mr Jos Vicente Leiva and decided to institute proceedings for reinstatement in the labour court and also, in connection with the anti-union dismissal, to lodge a complaint with the Labour Commission of the Chamber of Deputies of the Nation, with the ILO and with the OECD, since a multinational corporation is concerned.
.In its communication of November  and June , the Government states that, on account of the complaint, the Ministry of Labour summoned the president of the corporation in question to a hearing. The hearing took place on  October  and the Ministry of Labour urged the company to review the situation, proposing that a solution be sought through the administrative authority. On  October the company reported supposed irregularities in the establishment of the union of which Mr Jos Vicente Leiva is the general secretary, further to which the CTA had ten days in which to reply, but there have been no new developments in this regard. With regard to the registration of the trade union, the National Directorate for Trade Union Associations indicates that the relevant proceedings were initiated in August , that it was decided in November to verify the compliance with the requirements stipulated in national legislation, and that the relevant file was requested on  December  by the Federal Court No.  of the Province of San Juan and submitted to it. Moreover, aware that proceedings have been instituted in the national labour court, the Government considers it appropriate to wait for a ruling to be issued and keep the Committee informed accordingly.
.In its communications of August , the Government informs that proceedings for amparo (constitutional protection) are currently ongoing before the National Labour Court of First Instance , which have been initiated by Mr Leiva and that the court decided on his preventive reinstatement in the identical grade and under the same working hour arrangements as an interim measure.
.In a communication dated  November , the Government forwards a communication made by the Government of the",0,2009,Argentina
142,"Province of San Juan mentioning the following: () the responsibility for managing matters related to trade union organizations is a federal power; () no complaints have been lodged before the Provincial Administration on the issue mentioned in the request; () complainants may have access to judicial proceedings if they so wish; () the federal judge of the Province of San Juan examines a complaint (that is still pending) on issues related to the official status (personeria gremial) lodged by an organization against another organization called AOMA, which has also requested that a criminal case be initiated against Mr Jos Vicente Leiva.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organization alleges the wrongful dismissal on  July  of Mr Jos Vicente Leiva, the general secretary of the OSMA ?whose application for registration as a union is being processed ?by the Barrick Gold Corporation (which merged with the Homestake company). The Committee also notes the CTAs claim that the union leader was dismissed on the same day that the constituent documents for the OSMA were being certified in the presence of a notary and that the grounds for the dismissal were his trade union activity and his constant claims for improved working conditions, as well as the actual establishment of the union.
.The Committee notes the Governments statement that: () the Ministry of Labour summoned the president of the corporation in question to a hearing on  October , in the course of which the company was urged to review the situation and it was proposed that a solution be sought through the administrative authority; () on  October  the company reported supposed irregularities in the establishment of the union and the CTA had ten days in which to reply but has not done so to date; () the National Directorate for Trade Union Associations informs that the proceedings for the registration of the union were initiated in August , and that the Federal Court No.  of San Juan requested and received the file in December ; () proceedings for amparo (constitutional protection) are currently ongoing before the National Labour Court of First Instance, which have been initiated by Mr Leiva, and the court decided on his preventive reinstatement in the identical grade and under the same working hour arrangements as an interim measure; and () aware that proceedings have been instituted in the national labour court, the Government considers it appropriate to wait for a ruling to be issued in this respect. According to the provincial Government, a competing trade union organization has started a civil judicial proceeding against the official status (personeria gremial) of OSMACTA and a criminal action against Mr Jos Vicente Leiva.
.In this regard, taking into account that the Government does not refer to the grounds of the dismissal of the trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure the reinstatement of union leader Mr Jos Vicente Leiva in his post as decided by the judicial authority in the framework of the judicial proceeding regarding his dismissal. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the final ruling.
.Finally, observing that: () the complainant states that the application for registration of the OSMA is being processed by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security; () the Government states that it was the company in question that reported supposed irregularities in the constitution of the union, and that the file concerning the registration of the union was submitted to Federal Court No.  of San Juan; and () a trade union organization has started a civil judicial proceeding against the official status (personeria gremial) of the OSMA (pending) and a criminal action against union leader Mr Jos Vicente Leiva, the Committee requests the Government to proceed with the registration of the OSMA, provided no irregularities have been found and, in any case, not to prevent its functioning. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the abovementioned judicial proceeding.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure the reinstatement of union leader Mr Jos Vicente Leiva in his post as decided by the judicial authority in the framework of the judicial proceeding concerning his dismissal. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the final ruling.(b) The Committee requests the Government to proceed with the registration of the OSMA, provided no irregularities have been found and, in any case, not to prevent its functioning. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the abovementioned judicial proceeding.",2,2009,Argentina
143,".The Committee last examined this complaint at its November  meeting and on that occasion presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th (November ) meeting, paras ?].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting in November , the Committee made the following recommendations [see the th Report, paragraph ]:(a) The Committee notes with concern the gravity of the allegations made in this case (violent repression of protestors, temporary detention of trade union leaders and protestors, firearms attacks on the home of a trade union leader and UOCRA headquarters building, temporary kidnapping with the aim of intimidating a trade union leader and interference by the provincial authorities in the establishment of a trade union, etc.), deeply regrets the climate of violence that emerges from the allegations, and urges the Government to take immediate action to ensure that investigations are carried out into all the allegations and to send its observations and those of the Chubut provincial authorities thereon.(b) The Committee expects that UOCRA can once again use its headquarters in Comodoro Rivadavia. The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee further urges the Government to take the necessary measures for carrying out a thorough investigation into the alleged destruction and misappropriation of UOCRA property and valuables during the occupation of the headquarters and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee awaits the response of the Chubut provincial authorities on these allegations.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its comments on a possible direct contacts mission that should focus its cooperation efforts on freedom of association in the Province of Chubut.(d) The Committee draws the Governing Bodys attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.
.In a communication dated  February , the provincial Government states first that the Republic of Argentina has a federal political system. As a result of this, the country is represented externally in accordance with article  of the national Constitution, and the Government states that its reply is therefore limited to what has already been indicated by the Province of Chubut. It adds that the situation described in this case, which the ILO has described as serious, is not found in any other jurisdiction in the country.
.The Government states that according to the provincial authorities, the issues raised in the complaint by the Argentinean Building Workers?Union (UOCRA) refer not only to alleged anti-union practices but also places special emphasis on the possible existence of a campaign of persecution against one of its officials, Mr Mateos Surez, General Secretary of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA. The provincial Government states that UOCRA, in order to substantiate its statements, described what happened on  November  when the union decided to block the sole access road into the tourist resort of Puerto Pirmide during a sympathy strike in response to the dispute that had arisen as a result of the dismissal of  workers of the company Dragados y Obras Portuarias SA (DYCASA). According to press reports at that time, the union, faced with the dismissal of  workers employed by DYCASA, decided to strike in solidarity with the dismissed workers and a call was made to carry on strike action at the entrance to the villa in question.
.The provincial government goes on to state that some days before, the resorts tourist office made its concerns known to the Governor, given the communitys total reliance on tourism and the fact that the action blocked the sole access road, thus posing a potential threat to traders and other inhabitants. The Governor sought to prevent the direct action from proceeding, failing which action would be taken to clear the road. He has reminded the unions leaders that blocking the road is a federal offence. The provincial authorities have stated that in response to what happened, police were sent in to avert possible violence, their orders being solely to maintain peace and public order and to ensure unrestricted access for anyone wishing to enter Puerto Pirmide.
.The provincial authorities maintain that, when faced with the presence of the police, the strikers reacted in a negative way and this resulted in disturbances which necessitated police intervention to contain the strikers, and that subsequently Mr Mateos Surez claimed that the provincial authorities had ordered the police to disperse the strikers, disregarding the workers?rights. They stress that police action was confined to reducing violence and did not involve, in the words of Mr Mateos Surez in repeated statements to the press, the most blatant and excessive police repression? The events led to the arrest of the union official in question, who was accused of civil disobedience (article  of the Penal Code), blocking a highway (article  of the Penal Code) and incitement to commit offences (article  of the Penal Code).
.As regards the direct action measures, the provincial authorities claim that UOCRAs action was part of a solidarity?strike which is not in itself illicit, but requires a degree of caution and discretion in expressing solidarity, which must be linked to the issue over which strike action is being taken. According to the provincial authorities, the direct action took place at the same time as a number of complaints were being made against Mr Suarez, which concerned a number of offices (serious assault, irregular payments and diversion of workers?money or requests for financial contributions in exchange for agreeing to more flexible working conditions inferior to the normal minimum conditions), and that from then onwards the situation became even more violent. According to the provincial government, this was aggravated by the complaints made by the employers concerned, who eventually resolved to bring the case before the courts with groups of dissidents, and demanded the removal of the official in question on the grounds that they felt he did not represent them.
.The provincial authorities link these events to a confrontation that took place in November  at the headquarters of the Puerto Madryn branch between a group of unemployed workers and UOCRA officials. On that occasion the police had to intervene in order to secure the premises and prevent them from being occupied by the opposing group. They also claim that the workers stated that they were discriminated against for not thinking like the officials, who prevented them from being hired, and for that reason demanded the removal of these officials. According to the provincial government, the situation provoked a response from the general public, from traders and neighbours in the area, who repudiated what had happened, and this prompted the judicial authority to seek the removal of Mr Surez, who stands accused of seriously injuring two individuals. In this context, the provincial governments concern is growing, given that the excesses that have occurred threaten members of the general public, who are obliged to seek refuge whenever these groups confront one another (the authorities note that one such incident involved a kindergarten in Puerto Madryn). It adds that given these circumstances and the level of violence that has occurred, police intervention was imperative, not in order to restrict constitutional rights of free expression but to contain the incidents and restore order in the community.
.The provincial government has repeatedly denied the allegations, and stated that its sole priority is to safeguard public safety and social peace, and for that reason it has urged that trade union issues be resolved peacefully through the appropriate channels; situations of this type nevertheless persist. For example, on  December ,  workers from the company JS Construcciones reported that they were going to be dismissed at as a result of pressure from Mr Surez because they belonged to Obreros Unidos del Chubut?(United Workers of Chubut), a group within the union that opposed the current UOCRA leadership, as a reprisal for the demonstration in which there had been confrontations and shots fired. It adds that on  October , a number of construction workers turned up in order to express their opposition to the provincial representative. The anger of the demonstrators boiled over when the Governor left the municipal building to go to the official car which was surrounded by the group of individuals in question, who blocked his way. As he was unable to go forward, the representative got out of the car and started walking, to the accompaniment of insults from the group. Stones and bottles were thrown, some of which struck and damaged the cars rear window, and the crowd also molested a provincial deputy. The Governor lodged a complaint against UOCRA with the State Prosecution Service.
.Lastly, the provincial government states that it is clear from the above that there has been no persecution of Mr Mateos Surez, who has in fact been charged with a number of offences",-1,2009,Argentina
144,"that are being investigated, and for which reason removal of his union immunity is being sought.
.The Committee recalls that when it last examined this case at its November  meeting, it noted with concern the gravity of the allegations made in this case, deeply regretted the climate of violence that emerged from the allegations, and: () urged the Government to take immediate action to ensure that investigations were carried out into all the allegations (violent repression of protestors, temporary detention of trade union leaders and protestors, firearms attacks on the home of a trade union leader and UOCRA headquarters building, temporary kidnapping with the aim of intimidating a trade union leader and interference by the provincial authorities in the establishment of a trade union, etc.), and to send its observations and those of the Chubut provincial authorities; () expected that UOCRA could once again use its headquarters in Comodoro Rivadavia; () urged the Government to take the necessary measures for carrying out a thorough investigation into the alleged destruction and misappropriation of UOCRA property and valuables during the occupation of the headquarters and requested the Government to keep it informed in that respect; and () requested the Government to send its comments on a possible direct contacts mission that should focus its cooperation efforts on freedom of association in the Province of Chubut.
.The Committee notes the Governments statements to the effect that the situation referred to in the complaint, which has been described by the ILO as serious, is not found in any other jurisdiction in the country, and states that according to the Government of the province of Chubut: () the complaint refers not only to alleged anti-union practices but also to the existence of a campaign of persecution against the General Secretary of the Puerto Madryn branch of the UOCRA, Mr Mateos Surez; () on  November , UOCRA decided to block the only access to the tourist resort of Puerto Pirmide during a sympathy strike in response to a dispute following the dismissal of  workers of the company Dragados y Obras Portuarias SA (DYCASA); () the Governor sought to prevent the direct action from going ahead on the grounds that there was no obvious need to block the road, an act which, as he recalled, constitutes a criminal offence; () in response to the actions, police officers were sent to avert possible violence with the sole instruction to maintain peace and public order, and to ensure free passage for anyone wishing to enter the resort Puerto Pirmide; ()faced with the police presence, the strikers reacted in a negative way; there were disturbances and police intervention became necessary, and this was limited to reducing violence; () the events culminated in the arrest of union official Mr Mateos Surez, who has been accused of civil disobedience, blocking a road, and incitement to commit offences; () the direct action took place at the same time as a number of complaints were being made against Mr Surez (relating to serious assault, irregular payments and diversion of workers?money), and the provincial government links these facts with the confrontation in November  at the headquarters of the Puerto Madryn branch, when the police was obliged to intervene to secure the premises; () the judicial authority of the province requested the removal of the trade union immunity of Mr Surez, who is accused of seriously injuring two individuals; () on  October  construction workers expressed their opposition to the Governor of the Province, insulted him and threw objects at his official car; and () the provincial government has not persecuted Mr Surez, who has in fact been accused by the courts of a number of offences that are now being investigated.
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government of Chubut Province concerning the events that occurred during the demonstration organized by UOCRA acting in solidarity with the dismissed construction workers and concerning the union official Mr Mateos Surez. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial proceeding under way against the official in question. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to provide its observations concerning the other  union officials and activists who were arrested during the demonstration, namely: () Jonathan Surez, union activist; () Benjamn Bustos, trade union activist; ()Alejandro Jimnez, trade union activist; () Richard Villegas, Records Secretary of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA; () Eliseo Amaya, DYCASA workers?representative; () Diego Paz, trade union activist; () Mario Bisoso, dismissed worker of the abovementioned company; () Carlos Muoz, company worker; () Daro Valenzuela, dismissed company worker; () Jorge Franco, dismissed company worker; and () Flix Daz, representative of the company; and urges the Government to send these observations without delay and in particular to indicate the specific allegations against them, whether or not they have been accused of any offence, and the status of any judicial proceedings against them.
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not provided its observations on the other allegations that had remained pending. Under these circumstances the Committee urges the Government: () to take the necessary steps to carry out investigations immediately into the allegations according to which: (i) on  June , the home of Mr Ricardo Luis Cheuquepal, a member of the Comodoro Rivadavia branch of UOCRA, was shot at; (ii) at the request of the provincial authorities, a closed criminal case was reopened against members of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA; (iii) at the same time that UOCRA was being discredited and criminalized in order to promote a new trade union, with the assent of the provincial authorities, several businesses began to be attacked by this group and the Comodoro Rivadavia council was also subject to violent actions by armed persons; (iv) a Chubut provincial government official used electronic means to express insulting opinions and assessments about UOCRA members and union officials; (v) the General Secretary of the Trelew branch of UOCRA was kidnapped and, following death threats against his family, was forced to make radical statements against Mr Surez; and (vi) on  November , armed groups known as Los Dragones?(The Dragons) attacked UOCRA headquarters in Puerto Madryn and Comodoro Rivadavia. The Committee requests the Government: () to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigations conducted into all these allegations; () to ensure that UOCRA has the use of its union premises in Comodoro Rivadavia and to keep it informed in this regard; and () to take the necessary steps to carry out a thorough investigation into the alleged destruction and appropriation of UOCRA property during the occupation of the headquarters, and to inform it accordingly.
.Lastly, the Committee notes with concern that according to the reply from the Government of Chubut Province, there is a climate of tension between the authorities and the construction workers affiliated to UOCRA (according to the provincial government, the Governor was insulted and his car damaged by construction workers), and that according to UOCRAs statement in the complaint, actions aiming to discredit it and hamper the free exercise of its trade union functions originated at the highest levels of the provincial government. The malicious intention of such actions was to encourage the creation of a new local body to be organized and to act in conformity with the authorities?[see thReport, para. ].
.Taking the foregoing conclusions into account, the Committee once again requests the Government to agree to a direct contacts mission to help appease the situation and explain to the competent authorities the principles of freedom of association which should guide efforts to resolve the problems that have arisen.
.Noting that the Government limits itself in its reply to the observations made by the provincial Government, the Committee wishes to emphasize that it is the responsibility of the national Government to ensure that the principles of freedom of association are respected in the relevant province.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial proceedings against the union official Mr Mateos Surez. The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on the other  union officials and activists who were arrested during the demonstration, namely: () Jonathan Surez, union activist; () Benjamn Bustos, trade union activist; () Alejandro Jimnez, trade union activist; ()Richard Villegas, Records Secretary of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA; () Eliseo Amaya, workers?representative of Dragados y Obras Portuarias SA (DYCASA); () Diego Paz, trade union activist; () Mario Bisoso, dismissed worker of the aforementioned company; () Carlos Muoz, company worker; () Daro Valenzuela, dismissed company worker; () Jorge Franco, dismissed company worker; and () Flix Daz, representative of the company; and urges the Government to send these observations without delay and in particular to indicate the specific allegations against them, whether or not they have been accused of any offence, and the status of any judicial proceedings against them.(b) The Committee urges the Government: ()",1,2009,Argentina
145,"to take the necessary steps to carry out investigations immediately into the allegations according to which: (i) on  June , the home of Mr Ricardo Luis Cheuquepal, a member of the Comodoro Rivadavia branch of UOCRA, was shot at; (ii) at the request of the provincial authorities, a closed criminal case was reopened against members of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA; (iii) at the same time that UOCRA was being discredited and criminalized in order to promote a new trade union, with the assent of the provincial authorities, several businesses began to be attacked by this group and the Comodoro Rivadavia council was also subject to violent actions by armed persons; (iv) a Chubut provincial government official used electronic means to express insulting opinions and assessments about UOCRA members and union officials; (v)the General Secretary of the Trelew branch of UOCRA was kidnapped and, following death threats against his family, was forced to make radical statements against Mr Surez; and (vi) on  November  armed groups known as Los Dragones?(The Dragons) attacked UOCRA headquarters in Puerto Madryn and Comodoro Rivadavia. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any investigations into all these allegations; () to ensure that UOCRA has the use of its union premises in Comodoro Rivadavia and to keep it informed in this regard; ()to take the necessary steps to carry out a thorough investigation into the alleged destruction and appropriation of UOCRA property during the occupation of the headquarters, and to inform it accordingly.(c) The Committee once again requests the Government to agree to a direct contacts mission to help calm the situation and explain to the competent authorities the principles of freedom of association which should guide efforts to resolve the problems that have arisen.(d) The Committee draws the Governing Bodys attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Argentinean Building Workers?Union (UOCRA) dated  July . UOCRA sent further information in a communication dated  July  and more allegations in communications dated  August and December .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July , UOCRA states that it is making a formal complaint against the Argentinean Government and the Province of Chubut for violation of the principles of freedom of association. UOCRA states that it is a primary trade union organization that operates throughout Argentina. The scope as to categories of persons and geographical area covered by it come under the terms of the official trade union status, which was granted to the organization under section . Law No.  and its regulatory Decree No. , both passed in , are the source of regulation for workers?trade union associations. This legal agreement comes under the federal authoritys regulatory powers and is applied in an exclusive and excluding manner throughout the country. UOCRA states that it is making this clarification because, for the purposes of the complaint, it should be pointed out that Argentina has a federal system and comprises  provinces and an autonomous city, which are autonomous districts that exercise all the powers that have not been delegated at the federal level. Standards relating to trade unions and trade union activities have remained under the competence and control of the federal authorities.
.UOCRA emphasizes that the scope of its representation is national. The legal basis for its representation originates in the standards mentioned and in the instrument registering official trade union status. This accords exclusive representation to UOCRA for all construction workers, and it has duly demonstrated that it is a sufficiently representative organization by the number of its members throughout Argentina. While no dispute has arisen that questions this status of being sufficiently representative, no other bodies or non-members of UOCRA can be authorized to carry out trade union activities under current legislation.
.UOCRA indicates that the alleged incidents were carried out at the request and instigation of the Chubut provincial authorities, and with their consent and participation. UOCRA states that, as will rapidly be deduced from the events described below, actions and practices that infringe on the exclusive rights of the organization have occurred and continue to occur at the provincial level, with the highest authority and Chubut provincial executive authority officials with competence in labour relations compromising trade union autonomy and, as a result, the principles and guarantees of freedom of association. This situation has been affected and made worse by the intervention of the representative of the federal administrative labour authority who, together with the provincial labour authority: () firstly adopted an administrative decision in an alleged labour dispute that was non-existent and was in fact a criminal offence of usurpation ?the violent occupation of the headquarters of a branch of UOCRA; and () secondly, conferred de facto legitimacy to a group with no representation but which ended up being endorsed by the Chubut provincial authorities.
.The complainant adds, moreover, that the federal administrative authority representative was not authorized to receive the keys of a building owned by UOCRA, as there was a court order to return them to their legal owner, the trade union. Ultimately, the national Government should take responsibility and guarantee freedom of association to all extents and purposes, as stated by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.UOCRA also states that actions aiming to discredit it and hamper the free exercise of its trade union functions originated at the highest levels of the provincial government. The malicious intention of such actions was to encourage the creation of a new local body to be organized and to act in conformity with the authorities?wishes. It should be mentioned that UOCRA respects the free expression and decisions of the workers, but it warns that this right is being manipulated by the authorities. Therefore, from the point of view of freedom of expression, this is illegal because the will of the workers has been distorted by the authorities because it was done through unlawful violent acts.
.According to the complainant, the provincial authorities have been involved, whether through action or negligence, in perpetuating an extreme situation, including by supporting the violent occupation of the headquarters building of a branch of UOCRA and by a series of actions and offences of varying magnitude, all aimed at excluding UOCRA from the provincial arena and preventing it from exercising legitimate rights to defence and representation on behalf of its construction worker members. The Governor of the Province of Chubut, under the pretext of an objective analysis of the situation but actually in his own political interests, hampers the professional development of UOCRA, publically discredits its leaders and questions its actions and methods. He does not do this in a detached and disinterested way, however; he does it at the same time as encouraging the creation of a new trade union that acts in his interests. In this situation of abuse and suppression of freedom of association, the Governor has made public statements, saying: Gone is the complicity between unscrupulous employers and trade union officials, trade unionists that negotiate behind the backs of the workers: they are the ones that discredit genuine trade union organizations acting in defence of the workers, unions formed of responsible and rational men who can feel on an equal footing with their employer and discuss relevant matters. Gone are unfair and arbitrary candidate selections, of whoever they may be. I have said this to Gerardo Martnez as it concerns him; he may be secretary of UOCRA, but I am the Governor of all the workers.?(These statements were published in the newspaper, the Diario de Madryn, on Friday,  June .)
.UOCRA states that what he did not say was that he agreed to the violence, the coercion and the attack on the lawfully constituted trade union. UOCRA indicates that the Governor of the Province of Chubut seems to consider himself the owner?of the workers of the province that he governs and that he has the right to decide who?should represent them and how that should be done? as if that is not enough, he also offends UOCRA officials and trivializes the lawful representation of the officials elected directly by all UOCRA members, who account for  per cent of registered construction workers.
.UOCRA states that, because of the nature of the complaint, it should be categorized as serious and urgent, with the consequences that that implies. This is a serious violation of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), and of the  resolution of the International Labour Conference concerning the independence of the trade union movement. UOCRA adds that it is a primary trade union organization (its members are individual workers throughout Argentina). In accordance with the provisions of Chapter XIV of the Social Statutes, its work in",1,2009,Argentina
146,"the different areas is done through its branches and divisions. In the Province of Chubut, the Comodoro Rivadavia branch, among others, has been in existence for a long time. This branch includes workers from that particular area of the province.
.The complainant alleges that the violent occupation of the building that functions as a trade union headquarters ?located at Rawson , Comodoro Rivadavia, Chubut Province ?took place on  March . This was promptly reported to the local criminal justice authorities and a claim ?that the municipal, local and national officials have not acted on ?was lodged with the authorities concerning illegal deprivation of liberty, usurpation and damage to property, all as actual concurrent offences, before the Criminal Court in case No. , entitled Muoz, Sergio J. concerning UOCRA claim of usurpation, court application No. . It is worth mentioning that, as a result of this violent action, which lasted more than  days, the defence of the rights of the construction workers of the area was seriously compromised because of the unlawful and abrupt ceasing of trade union activities, caused by the non-permitted entry and continued presence of an armed group in the abovementioned headquarters and nearby streets.
.In addition to being deprived of the use and the enjoyment of its property, UOCRA suffered the following consequences as a result of the violent occupation of its headquarters: (a) discontent from the community over, among other things, the difficulties experienced by residents because of vandalism and police barriers; (b) the destruction and breakage of different items in its property, such as computers, furniture and the building itself; (c) the misappropriation of documents and valuables; and (d) the damage to other institutions near the headquarters, which affected, for example, the daily running of a health-care institution providing services for construction workers and their families.
.The complaint draws attention to the local courts delay in ordering the eviction. The Public Prosecutors Office requested an eviction order from the judge, but she turned it down. Faced with the provincial criminal courts?clear lack of willingness to evict the usurpers, an application for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) was brought (UOCRA v. Fernndez Daro and others concerning application for amparo, dossier No./, before Civil and Commercial Court No.  of the Comodoro Rivadavia district). As a precautionary measure, the courts presiding judge ordered the return of the building to UOCRA, instructing the head of the provincial police force accordingly. Following the operational difficulties expressed by the police, owing to a lack of staff and the impossibility of maintaining order for a period of time that could be extended or extensive, the action was carried out after a longer-than-usual delay, which once again revealed the provincial authorities acting in their own interest and interfering. Not satisfied with meddling in the business of the trade union, the authorities tried to do the same to the judicial body, even infringing the separation of powers, by doing everything possible to postpone the fulfilment of the judges orders. No other conclusion can be arrived at if it is taken into account that, in order for an eviction to be carried out, the courts need the assistance of the provincial police, which is under the direct control of the provincial authorities.
.The eviction did not happen and UOCRA was badly affected when the usurpers gave the keys of the trade union premises, the building that had been vandalized by them, to the federal administrative labour authority. Subsequent legal action was necessary to make the Ministry allow access to the abovementioned building. UOCRA always requested a complete investigation of the events and the identification of the persons that had usurped the trade union headquarters building and it submitted all the evidence available to it, through the correct legal channels, to the judicial authorities. However, the provincial authorities did not have the same attitude, despite knowing that many of them were not construction workers, and that the reasons for the usurpation were clearly political and unrelated to the trade union. The usurpers clearly relied on the consensus and support of the authorities whose leader, confidently and in his own interest, promoted and used the press to demonstrate his liking and preference for that group, and did not condemn in any way the vandalism and unlawful criminal acts of the persons used to achieve his aim of chasing UOCRA from the province.
.Once again, the provincial labour authorities sanctioned this group, letting it take part in labour policy through site inspections that, shockingly, were not limited to the specific geographical area of its place of work, the Cerro Dragn, but which took place throughout Comodoro Rivadavia, in the Province of Chubut. Once again, this showed their clear intention of pushing out the UOCRA union. Showing his preference and allegiance, the Governor intervened directly into the trade unions activity in the province, in violation of all the rules of freedom of association, and encouraged the establishment of provincial trade unions that followed his political agenda.
.UOCRA adds that, at about the same time, and as another example that the authorities?endorsement of vigilante justice over the law causes more violence, on  June, the house of the head of the Comodoro Rivadavia branch of UOCRA, Mr Ricardo Luis Cheuquepal, was attacked. Unknown persons shot high-powered weapons at the house (located in the Trespinos area) while his youngest children were at home.
.UOCRA asks the Chairperson of the Committee on Freedom of Association to request a preliminary direct contacts mission to raise awareness of the relevant principles of freedom of association and the procedures of the International Labour Organization, and to gain an informal overview, on the ground, of the circumstances that have been brought to the Committees attention. At the same time, and separate from the conclusions reached with regard to the abovementioned request, UOCRA requests the Chairperson of the Committee on Freedom of Association, to communicate the above without further delay and as a matter of utmost seriousness ?and ask the Government of Argentina to agree to the sending of a direct contacts mission, which should focus its cooperation efforts on the situation of freedom of association in the Province of Chubut and, through the national authorities, ensures the full enjoyment of the rights and guarantees of freedom of association in Chubut, compensating for the consequences of past actions, immediately ceasing current actions, and ensuring that such actions do not happen again.
.In its communication of  July , UOCRA alleges further actions linked with the violations of freedom of association duly communicated to the Committee. According to UOCRA, there are additional circumstances and further incidents that confirm the extreme seriousness of the account given, demonstrating the Governors encouragement of the formation of violent groups and his support of them as part of an attempt to promote the establishment of a new trade union that acts in accordance with his local and national political interests.
.UOCRA adds that, in addition to the events reported in its submission of July  and in view of the upcoming closure of a political campaign that he was directly involved in, the Governor of the Province of Chubut took part in a public event to support the campaign. During this event, the violent groups showed their support. These are the groups, duly reported above, that are trying to exercise de facto trade union representation of construction workers. He was probably thanking them for their support and showing his in turn, linking his policies with the new trade union. The political and economic support is obvious. Those that would accept the new trade union have shown it in public, as stated in this newspaper report: The head of Los Dragones yesterday received the strong support of Governor Mario Das Neves to establish a new trade union for construction workers that will be separate from UOCRA?(as reported in the Crnica daily newspaper). Further on in this report it states: The Governor was the only one who supported us until now and this is why we are confident that he will know how to resolve the issues that may arise in this difficult fight. ?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.UOCRA alleges that, in addition to the events described above, there has been a new development that is as much or even more serious. According to UOCRA, this was part of a plan to persecute its leader using political and trade union means, with the aim of excluding it from the Province of Chubut and replacing it with the trade union favoured by the local authorities, which is suggestible and acts in their interests. In a surprising move that shows the clear control that the authorities have over the judiciary, and their disregard for fundamental republican guarantees, there was an attempt to relaunch an old criminal case against members of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA, which had been thrown out of court.
.In particular, at the instigation of the authorities, local criminal justice officials have infringed, in each and every headquarters building, guarantees under due process, reopening a criminal case that, at the time, was closed,",1,2009,Argentina
147,"with the single aim of politically persecuting the General Secretary of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA and attempting to imprison him. In an attempt to justify such actions, the Public Prosecutors Office argued that it had made a previous error?and, going back on steps it had already taken, submitted the issue before a clearly incompetent judge, removing the case from the general jurisdictional court and disregarding other, extremely relevant, points, such as: full freedom of association; the existence of privileges for express constitutional and legal obligations; the need for specific and separate proceedings; and the powers of UOCRA, among others.
.As can be seen, the actions described amount no more and no less to an attempt to infringe the standards of the constitution of Chubut and the non bis in idem principle, which is enshrined in the national Constitution of Argentina. Aside from that, a shocking lack of impartiality and independence has been shown by the judiciary, which does not hesitate to demonstrate its functions and its loyalty to the authorities by assisting them in their assault, not only against a trade union, but against freedom of association itself. This cannot and must not be tolerated, especially since it is similar to suspect practices that have caused such harm in Argentina.
.According to UOCRA, it emerges from the facts described that the authorities know no limits in interfering and attempting to increase interference in its trade union autonomy. A campaign has been put together to persecute UOCRA and its leaders that involves interference by the justice system and inaction and a lack of collaboration by the political authorities in the face of violence towards the leaders and their families and trade union property. All of these actions are clearly aimed at promoting and establishing a new trade union that is controlled by the provincial government.
.UOCRA alleges that all of the conduct and practices discussed have had an immediate effect. Appeals by several prominent figures from the province, including employers, about the attempted discrediting and criminalizing of UOCRA in order to benefit a new trade union, led them to also falling victim to criminal acts of violence. In the absence of an investigation into or condemnation of the actions against UOCRA, and with the consent of the provincial authorities, who turned a blind eye, several businesses began to fall victim to the new trade unions violent practices that were aimed at imposing its so-called representatives. Even the Comodoro Rivadavia council did not escape the violence and vandalism by the groups associated with the new trade union who, brandishing firearms, invaded the municipal headquarters, destroyed furniture and detained people for a considerable period of time.
.According to UOCRA, all of these events clearly show that the local authorities?aim is nothing less than violating trade union autonomy, excluding UOCRA representation from the province and creating a trade union that is suggestible and sympathetic to its political interests and carries out violence that they cover up.
.In its communication of  August , UOCRA states that, in addition to the events alleged in the complaint, a further event has occurred; namely the use of electronic means by someone identified as being from the Governors office, referring to a hypothetical presentation given at the International Labour Organization, containing opinions and assessments that are not only damaging to UOCRA but also to members of executives, who have been elected by members in a direct, secret vote. UOCRA considers that this communication brings a very serious fact to the attention of the Committee because, up until the time in question, the violence had been carried out by groups with official connections?and discussed by the Governor himself. However, in this case, it can be said that the violence originated at the State level and it confirms that the actions taken against UOCRA were orchestrated and covered up by the provincial authorities. According to UOCRA, the person in question is, and has been, a Chubut government official. That is to say, it is a political commissar?of the Chubut provincial government, not even a senior official of the workers involved in the dispute, who is intensifying violations of freedom of association Conventions and institutions.
.In its communication of November , UOCRA alleges further events that corroborate its complaint that the authorities of the Province of Chubut, at the request of their highest authority, the Governor of the Province, have planned and carried out a campaign of persecution against local UOCRA leaders and, in particular, the General Secretary of its Puerto Madryn branch.
.UOCRA indicates that the events, which were limited in number in its initial submission, have increased following the submission of the first complaint. This requires the immediate intervention of the Director-General, with due consultation with the Chairperson of the Committee on Freedom of Association, and a preliminary direct contacts mission should be carried out as a matter of urgency. The justification for this exceptional step is the unusual situation of the Province of Chubut where, not only does official interference in trade union activities take place, but it is becoming more widespread. UOCRA alleges that, on  November , approximately  workers out of a total of  were dismissed. These were construction workers involved in the resurfacing of provincial road No.  for the company Dycasa. The workers affected by the companys arbitrary and unilateral decision were: Santiago Carrizo, Marco Ceballos, Mario Bisoso, Luca Paz Galvn, Leandro Marfil, Luis Romero, Franco Secco, Orlando Tenorio, Milton Tolava, Daro Valenzuela, Omar Vallejo, Juan Vargas, Gabriel Villegas, Jorge Orrego, Nicanor Carlos, Catriel Pichun, Jorge Prez, Jos Peredo, Jorge Franco, Jos Fuentes, Pablo Huenilian, Andrs Jofre, Rafael Loscar, Nelson Meruglia, Csar Olivares, Roberto Araya, Walter Busto, Fernndez Daz, Diego Snchez, Pablo Rivero, Sergio Aciar, Ivn Joi and Julio Arvalo.
.UOCRA states that, following this unilateral and arbitrary move by the company, the workers, honouring the principle of solidarity, decided to protest near the worksite along with their leaders, including Mateo Surez, General Secretary of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA. UOCRA alleges that the workers, who simply wanted to defend their jobs through this legitimate course of trade union action in the absence of a reply from the company or the government, were subjected to excessive and harsh police repression at the instigation of the provincial authorities. In this way, the right of the workers to assemble and petition was unfairly denied by the provincial authorities, which instructed the chief of the provincial police to suppress and disperse the protestors and imprison their leaders.
.The complainant indicates that, at this time, the trade union leader, Mr Surez, who has already been persecuted by the provincial and judicial authorities, was detained, imprisoned and charged with several crimes, such as disregard for the law (article  of the Penal Code), blocking a road (article  of the Penal Code), and incitement to commit a crime (article  of the Penal Code). Mr Surez was not the only one detained: the animosity of the police towards trade unions was demonstrated once again with the detention of ten other leaders and activists. They were also victims of an excessive police operation that included many officers and a special riot force, the special police operations group. The following persons have been detained: () Mateo Surez, General Secretary of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA; () Jonathan Surez, trade union activist; ()Benjamn Bustos, trade union activist; () Alejandro Jimnez, trade union activist; ()Richard Villegas, Records Secretary of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA; ()Eliseo Amaya, Dycasa workers?representative; () Diego Paz, trade union activist; ()Mario Bisoso, dismissed Dycasa worker; () Flix Daz, Dragados y Obras Portuarias SA representative; () Carlos Muoz, Dycasa worker; () Daro Valenzuela, dismissed Dycasa worker; and () Jorge Franco, dismissed Dycasa worker.
.UOCRA adds that all these leaders, activists and workers were also hit and shoved by the police. Given this unusual and violent response, and in view of the legitimacy of the demands, the General Confederation of Labour of the Rio Chubut Lower Valley, together with other major unions, expressed their disapproval and repudiation and demanded the release of the detained men in front of the local police station. They were freed as a result.
.The complainant indicates that, while these events were going on, the Governor of the Province (also the local police chief and controller) did not listen to the complaints or assist in resolving them, but instead ordered brutal suppression and tried to justify it under a pretext that not only turned out to be false, but also demonstrated his open and obvious enmity towards UOCRA and its leaders. Added to the other events that have been reported in this dossier, this is clear evidence of his favouritism and preference for another trade union. At about the same time that the events described took place, the Governor stated that Mr Mateo Surez is not a trade union leader, he is a criminal? In his attempt to justify his excessive and illegitimate actions, he stated that we said that we were not going to let him block the road in",-1,2009,Argentina
148,"any way. And for this, legal authorization is not required. Blocking the road is a crime and the police have to be called and they have to take action. If the police are resisted, what happened is an obvious consequence. He resisted the police and broke the law, and so he was arrested. The next step is up to the judge, who will probably release him?(see the  November  edition of the newspaper Diario el Chubut).
.UOCRA adds that, following the abovementioned arrests, Mr Miguens, General Secretary of the Trelew branch, was kidnapped in public by persons unknown who held him at gunpoint and threatened the lives of his family. They forced him to make public statements on the radio against Mr Surez. Once freed, Mr Miguens immediately retracted those statements and reported the events to the police and the court. He named the authorities as responsible for what had happened to him.
.Lastly, UOCRA states that the authorities tried to create chaos and confusion, facilitating action by armed groups unconnected with UOCRA, which brandished high-powered weapons and threatened the safety of UOCRA leaders, workers and activists. On November , the UOCRA headquarters in Puerto Madryn were attacked and in the afternoon of the same day, the UOCRA headquarters in Comodoro Rivadavia were shot at by supporters of the Governor called Los Dragones?(The Dragons?. All of these related events, of institutional importance, demonstrate that the trade unions existence in the Province of Chubut is at risk and, for this reason, this case should be considered serious and urgent.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that this case clearly includes practical, social and labour-related aspects. It concerns an issue that, owing to the nature of the dispute, had consequences at both the federal and provincial levels. It is linked, above all, to the autonomy of the provinces and the relations between the national and provincial authorities; in particular, in this case, the executive authority.
.The Province of Chubut has been notified about these actions but there has not yet been any response about their exact nature and about the various different instructions arising from them, which should be followed up at the federal level. Therefore, the response is based on the files produced at the national level, but they will be completed when the province provides the relevant information.
.With regard to the action taken by the national Ministry of Labour, the initial intervention by the administrative labour authority was made at the request of the Governor of the Province, who was aware that the situation could not be controlled by political means. Moreover, it should be pointed out that, during the legal proceedings for usurpation launched by UOCRA, entitled Muoz, Sergio J. concerning UOCRA claim of usurpation, case No. , the provincial Public Prosecutor questioned the chief of the regional board of the national Ministry of Labour for Comodoro Rivadavia about whether the national Ministry of Labour had taken any action and, if so, what form that took and whether it had achieved any results.
.In compliance with the guidelines, this regional board replied, in a note of  March , stating that the national Ministry of Labour had been unable to intervene in the situation described, as it was within the exclusive competence?of UOCRA to make decisions on the matter. The position of the Ministry fully complies with the provisions of ILO Convention No. . This did not prevent the Governor of the Province of Chubut requesting the assistance of the national labour authorities on the grounds that, given the complexity and sensitive nature of the events, mediation might be able to get the situation under control. The violence, with further damage, destruction and possible casualties, was a distressing situation, against the background of which the national labour authorities began taking unofficial steps to offer the workers occupying the trade union headquarters an opportunity for negotiation, with the result contained in the note replying to the request from the Public Prosecutor. This action by the Ministry meets international standards.
.It should be noted that the actions by the national Government did not violate the freedom of association of the complainant trade union at any time, given that UOCRA had lost the capacity to recover its trade union building, which was occupied by persons defined by the trade union as unconnected to the organization? Against the background of this distressing situation, events occurred that led to the national Ministry of Labour being identified as the mediator for a situation whose nature and scope were unconnected to it. Far from acting in a manner contrary to freedom of association, the Ministry took it upon itself to bring about social dialogue during the emergency. According to the Government, it acted in a way that promoted freedom of association by defending the complainants property and bringing about a controlled and peaceful ending to a highly tense political situation. The Government affirms that the course of action taken by the Ministry was also in accordance with the highest international standards, given that in the Resolution of  concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties it states that it is the duty of States to ensure the security of persons and the protection of the property of trade union organizations.
.The Government indicates that the situation became more complicated and the effects of the dispute increased and extended to several companies. The southern regional representative of the national Ministry of Labour, the regional national representative, the Secretary of Labour of the Province and several companies who proved that the dispute was affecting other areas all assisted in the surrender of the keys of the trade union premises and the relinquishing of the usurped building.
.Faced with the outsourcing of the dispute, the federal authorities classified the situation as falling under article  of Act No. , and called for compulsory conciliation. This Act states that: in the event that parties are unable to settle a dispute, either party, prior to taking direct action, should give notice to the administrative authorities for the launching of the compulsory conciliation procedure. The Ministry shall act ex officio if deemed appropriate, taking into account the nature of the dispute.?The Government wishes it to be made clear that, during this period, the national Ministry of Labour ?which took charge in the dispute in accordance with the abovementioned international standards ?complied with the legal requirements, making an inventory of the organizations assets and depositing the keys within  hours of them being surrendered by the occupants, as ordered by the Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance No.  of the judicial district of Comodoro Rivadavia ?secretariat No. .
.The Committee notes that, in this case, the complainant organization alleges that, against the background of a smear campaign initiated by the authorities of the Province of Chubut against UOCRA and their encouragement of the creation of a new trade union at the local level, the following acts were committed against the organization and its members: () on  March , an armed group violently occupied its headquarters in Comodoro Rivadavia for more than  days, destroying furniture and computers and stealing documents and valuables (according to UOCRA, an eviction took place after it brought a legal application for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) and the keys of the premises were surrendered to the administrative labour authorities and UOCRA had to request their return with an injunction); () on  June , the home of Mr Ricardo Luis Cheuquepal, a member of the Comodoro Rivadavia branch of UOCRA, was shot at; () at the request of the provincial authorities, a closed criminal case was reopened against members of the Puerto Madryn branch of UOCRA; () at the same time that UOCRA was being discredited and criminalized in order to promote a new trade union, with the assent of the provincial authorities, several businesses began to be attacked by this group and the Comodoro Rivadavia council was also subject to violent actions by armed persons; () a Chubut provincial government official used electronic means to express insulting opinions and assessments about UOCRA members and union officials; () workers members of UOCRA, accompanied by trade union leaders, including the General Secretary of the Puerto Madryn branch, Mr Mateo Surez, protested against the dismissal of more than workers and were violently repressed by the provincial police and  of the protestors (including Mr Surez) were temporarily detained; () the General Secretary of the Trelew branch of UOCRA was kidnapped and, following death threats against his family, was forced to make radical statements against Mr Surez; and () on  November  armed groups known as Los Dragones?(The Dragons) attacked UOCRA headquarters in Puerto Madryn and Comodoro Rivadavia.
.With regard to the alleged violent occupation by an armed group of the UOCRA headquarters on  March  in Comodoro Rivadavia, that lasted more than  days and included the destruction of furniture and computers and the theft of documents and valuables, the Committee notes the Governments statement that: ()",1,2009,Argentina
149,"this case clearly includes practical, social and labour-related aspects and that it concerns an issue that, owing to the nature of the dispute, had consequences at both the federal and provincial levels that are related to the autonomy of the provinces and relations between the national and provincial authorities; () the Province of Chubut has been notified about the complaint but its reply has not yet been received, so the Governments reply is based on the files produced at the national level; () given the complexity and sensitive nature of the events, the Chubut provincial authorities requested mediation by the national Ministry of Labour to get the situation under control; () the distressing violence led to the national labour authorities taking unofficial steps to offer the workers occupying the trade union headquarters an opportunity for negotiation; () the actions by the national Government did not violate the freedom of association of the complainant, given that UOCRA had lost the capacity to recover its trade union building, which was occupied by persons unconnected to the organization; () the national Ministry of Labour promoted freedom of association by defending the property of UOCRA and bringing about a controlled and peaceful resolution to the situation; () the dispute extended beyond the original dispute and extended to companies and, according to the statement of the regional delegation of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security that the Government sends with its response, the workers that occupied the UOCRA headquarters surrendered the keys of the premises to the representative of the national Ministry of Labour; () faced with the outsourcing of the dispute, the federal authorities called for compulsory conciliation; and () during this period, the Ministry of Labour, in compliance with legal requirements, made an inventory of the trade unions assets and deposited the keys, as ordered by the Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance No.  of the judicial district of Comodoro Rivadavia ?secretariat No. .
.The Committee looks forward to receiving a response to these allegations from the Chubut provincial authorities. However, taking into account the date of the submission of the complaint, the Committee emphasizes that the inviolability of trade union premises is a civil liberty which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights?and recalls that, when examining allegations of attacks carried out against trade union premises, it stated that activities of this kind create among trade unionists a climate of fear which is extremely prejudicial to the exercise of trade union activities and that the authorities, when informed of such matters, should carry out an immediate investigation to determine who is responsible and punish the guilty parties?[Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. Under these circumstances, the Committee, noting that no judicial authority has ordered UOCRA to evict its trade union premises in Comodoro Rivadavia, expects that the judicial authority that received the keys to the trade union headquarters from the national Ministry of Labour has returned those keys to UOCRA and expects that UOCRA can once again use its headquarters in Comodoro Rivadavia. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee further urges the Government to take the necessary measures for carrying out a thorough investigation on the alleged destruction and misappropriation of UOCRA property and valuables during the occupation of the headquarters and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Moreover, the Committee notes with concern the gravity of the rest of the allegations made in this case (violent repression of protestors, temporary detention of trade union leaders and protestors, firearms attacks on the home of a trade union leader and UOCRA headquarters, temporary kidnapping with the aim of intimidating a trade union leader and interference by the provincial authorities in the establishment of a trade union, etc.). The Committee notes the Governments statement to the effect that this case includes practical, social and labour-related aspects and that it concerns an issue that, owing to the nature of the dispute, had consequences at both the federal and provincial levels that are related to the autonomy of the provinces and relations between the national and provincial authorities, and that the Province of Chubut has been notified about the complaint but its reply has not yet been received, as a result of which the Governments reply is based on the files produced at the national level. In this respect, although it understands the difficulties of sending a complete response, owing to the different judicial authorities (provincial and national) involved in the case, the Committee regrets that, despite the time that has passed and the gravity of the allegations, the Government has only sent its response to one of the allegations made. In these circumstances, the Committee deeply regrets the climate of violence that emerges from the allegations, and urges the Government to take immediate action to ensure that investigations are carried out into all the allegations and to send its observations and those of the Chubut provincial authorities thereon.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that, at the time of submitting its complaint, the complainant requested that a preliminary direct contacts mission be carried out to transmit to the competent authorities the concern to which the events described in the complaint have given rise and to explain to these authorities the principles of freedom of association involved and, at the same time, given the serious nature of the allegations, requested that the Government be encouraged to agree to a direct contacts mission that should focus its cooperation efforts on the situation of freedom of association in the Province of Chubut. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with concern the gravity of the allegations made in this case (violent repression of protestors, temporary detention of trade union leaders and protestors, firearms attacks on the home of a trade union leader and UOCRA headquarters building, temporary kidnapping with the aim of intimidating a trade union leader and interference by the provincial authorities in the establishment of a trade union, etc.), deeply regrets the climate of violence that emerges from the allegations, and urges the Government to take immediate action to ensure that investigations are carried out into all the allegations and to send its observations and those of the Chubut provincial authorities thereon.(b) The Committee expects that UOCRA can once again use its headquarters in Comodoro Rivadavia. The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee further urges the Government to take the necessary measures for carrying out a thorough investigation into the alleged destruction and misappropriation of UOCRA property and valuables during the occupation of the headquarters and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee awaits the response of the Chubut provincial authorities on these allegations.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its comments on a possible direct contacts mission that should focus its cooperation efforts on freedom of association in the Province of Chubut.(d) The Committee draws the Governing Bodys attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.",-1,2009,Argentina
150,".The Committee last examined the substance of the case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras ?]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government: (i)to keep it informed regarding the fine applied to the Mendoza Association of Health Professionals (AMPROS) for non-compliance with the call to compulsory conciliation, of the ruling handed down; and (ii) to send its observations without delay on the allegations made by the Trade Union Federation of Health Professionals of the Argentine Republic (FESPROSA) concerning sanctions against certain trade unionists, and reiterated its invitation to the complainant organization, FESPROSA, to provide information on this matter.
.As part of the follow-up case, in its communication of  March  the Government refers to an agreement signed between AMPROS and the government of the province of Mendoza, which has been approved by the Governor of that province (ad referendum by the provincial legislature), and under which it was agreed to cancel the fine imposed by Resolution No./ and also to withdraw Violation Report No. . of December . The Government reports that, in accordance with the agreement, the relevant judicial and administrative proceedings were suspended. On the other hand, the text of the agreement should specify that when the approval formalities have been duly completed, the complaint lodged by AMPROS before the Committee would be withdrawn.
.Under these circumstances, since no other observations were provided by the complainants, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the case.
.The Committee last examined this case as to the merits in its March  meeting, at which it made the following recommendations: (a) the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the judgment that is handed down in connection with the allegations concerning the possibility of a sanction being imposed on AMPROS for not complying with a call for compulsory conciliation; and (b) as regards the allegations by FESPROSA concerning sanctions against certain trade unionists (the suspension of strikers in the province of Crdoba, as well as the suspension of the physician Vice President of SIPARSE, the dismissal of nine trade unionists and the transfer of a trade union delegate in the province of Santiago del Estero), the Committee has not been informed whether the penalized workers have instituted judicial proceedings in connection with the sanctions imposed, or of the possible grounds for those sanctions. In these conditions, the Committee requests the Government to clarify whether these workers have lodged appeals before the courts and, if so, to keep it informed of the outcome. In addition, the Committee invites the complainant to provide any additional information it considers necessary in this regard [see th Report, paras ?].
.In a communication of  May , AMPROS sends further information on the case and reports in particular that on  January  the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security of the Province of Mendoza issued resolution No. / penalizing AMPROS with a fine of ,, pesos (approximately US$,) on grounds of violation of the second compulsory conciliation ordered by the abovementioned Subsecretariat. According to AMPROS: () the fine amounts to persecution and violates freedom of association and the right to strike, and is unfounded because it is based on facts that are alleged but that do not exist; () the Governments aim is to harass the association in an attempt to eliminate it and avoid protests by health professionals; and () this is clearly borne out by the fact that the penalty was applied  months after the event, in order to put pressure on and extort money from the organization in the face of the new wage claims and the planned strikes.
.In a communication of July  the Government encloses a communication from the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security of the Government of the Province of Mendoza stating, in connection with the fine for non-compliance with the compulsory conciliation ordered in , that the matter is before the Fifth Labour Chamber, following an application for review of the administrative resolution imposing the fine, but that as yet there has been no ruling. Furthermore, in a communication of  February , the Government reports that the Guarantees Commission, convened by resolution No.  of the National Labour Secretariat, has intervened in the case in order to issue an opinion on minimum services in the dispute involving the Government of the Province of Mendoza and AMPROS (the Government encloses a copy of the commissions opinion).
.The Committee notes this information. With regard to recommendation (a) on the fine applied to AMPROS for non-compliance with the call to compulsory conciliation, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the ruling handed down. With regard to recommendation (b) the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these matters without delay. The Committee further recalls, in connection with this recommendation, that it invited the complainant organization FESPROSA to provide information in this regard.
.The complaint appears in a communication from the Mendoza Association of Health Professionals (AMPROS) dated  July . The Trade Union Federation of Health Professionals of the Argentine Republic (FESPROSA) endorsed this complaint in a communication of  July . FESPROSA presented new allegations in communications dated  November ,  January  and  May . AMPROS presented new allegations in a communication dated  August .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  July , AMPROS states that, after months of collective bargaining, agreement was reached with the State as the employer on a collective labour agreement, which was ratified by Law No.  on  May , published in the Official Gazette on  October , with amendments to section  and , and ratified by the professional workers?subcommittee of the provincial bargaining committee for the health sector. The agreement signed in the context of collective bargaining put an end to the existing industrial dispute, although the means required for its implementation remained to be provided by the relevant regulations. This gave rise to a new dispute. The complainant organization adds that, while the rule in question had been in effect since July , the transitional provisions contained in section  to  of the collective labour agreement established a period in which the State undertook to implement the measures required for the effective application of the agreement.
.For this reason, AMPROS granted the State an extension of  days, according to the minutes of the wage bargaining committee dated  January . The complainant organization states that the period agreed on for resolving the additional points of the agreement elapsed without the slightest response from the administration, so the assembly decided to declare a state of alert and mobilization for the period from  to  October . This culminated in a one-day work stoppage on  October , a measure that was determined, in accordance with section  of the Civil Code, because of the serious and repeated defaults committed by the employer. Nevertheless, the State docked workers?wages for the day, even though the work stoppage was characterized as withdrawal of services because of the default by the employer (the State). Faced with such a reaction, the trade union organization, in a note dated  October , reported the existence of a labour dispute and requested the Subsecretariat of Labour to order compulsory conciliation. It attached a list of defaults on the collective agreement, which gave rise to administrative report No. -A-.
.The complainant organization adds that, while the compulsory conciliation hearings were being held, it requested the establishment of the Standing Bargaining Committee on Interpretation, Application, Wages and Labour Relations in a note dated  December , which gave rise to administrative report No. -A-. Between  November  and  March , the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security of the province held hearings in the context of administrative report No. -A- and three hearings in the context of case No. -A-, both of which originated with the agency. Needless to say, the hearings were fruitless, since after five months of bargaining little progress had been made in dealing with the additional points, which were limited to just three (critical and semi-critical activity, disaster zones and promotion zones). These additional points have not been paid by the Government.
.This being the case, the trade union organization regarded the compulsory conciliation stage as having ended at the hearing on  March , and considered that the time was now right for the use of direct action. In the context of administrative report
.After this notice was given, the work stoppages announced for  and  April took place without incident, and, on  April , the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security issued ex officio, by means of Resolution No. /, a new call for compulsory conciliation. This call for conciliation was questioned by the trade union organization, which considered",-1,2009,Argentina
151,"it untimely and inadmissible in the light of the repeated delays in the regulatory activity entrusted to the executive branch and the unchangeable stance of seeking to make the salary increase dependent on the implementation of the collective labour agreement, subjects that had been discussed at length while the trade union had obtained no satisfactory response to its demands.
.The complainant organization indicates that the notification of direct action was sent to the controlling authorities  days before the call for compulsory conciliation was issued and that the second direct action was reported  hours before it began ( April at  p.m.). On  April, with the direct action in progress, the Subsecretariat of Labour, arguing that it had learned from the media that the trade union organization would not comply with the call for compulsory conciliation, issued a notice ordering the trade union to comply immediately with the compulsory conciliation procedure and to refrain from carrying out direct actions under penalty of law. The complainant considers that as it involves direct action in progress, and as the complainant has been enjoined to refrain from carrying out direct actions, this task becomes impossible to fulfil, because the notice says nothing about the immediate cessation or suspension of the direct action under way, nor does it order the suspension of the action within a legal deadline.
.According to the complainant organization, refrain?refers to the direct actions which the trade union organization might take in the future, not those in progress. For this reason, in view of the decisions adopted by the competent authority, the executive committee of the trade union had called an assembly of its members. The assembly took a final decision to suspend the direct actions planned for  and  May . This was the context in which the unions executive committee appeared at the conciliation hearing on  May , whereby it was simply complying with Resolution No. /, non-compliance with which was called for by the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security of the province.
.Lastly, in the context of administrative report No. -A-, the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security of the province issued Resolution No. /, which reads as follows: Mendoza,  April . Having regard to: administrative report
.No. -A-, which continues the pay negotiations for the professional health sector represented by the trade union AMPROS, the compulsory conciliation procedure has been decreed in accordance with the legislation in force; ... The Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security of the province of Mendoza hereby resolves: Section : To declare illegal the direct action carried out by the Mendoza Association of Health Professionals (AMPROS) for failing to comply with the compulsory conciliation procedure ordered in this decision, in accordance with section  and related provisions of Law No.  and, by extension, Laws Nos  and . It therefore substantially rejects the presentation made by the trade union organization objecting to Resolution No. /. Section : To request the intervention of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security of the Nation in a timely manner for the pertinent legal purposes, as stipulated in Law No. Section : To notify the parties and order registration and filing. Signed Dr Jorge Guido Gabutti ?Subsecretary of Labour and Social Security ?Ministry of the Interior, Justice and Human Rights ?Government of Mendoza.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The complainant organization states that, under such circumstances, the assembly held on the morning of  May  decided to attend the compulsory conciliation session, provided that the relevant legal proceedings were brought and the direct actions scheduled were suspended. It considers that the unions conduct in this context was always lawful, and that the proven evidence in the case confirms this. In its view, the States conduct which it called into question involved the adoption of measures designed to curtail the unions right to use direct action, with the resulting restriction on the exercise of freedom of association.
.The complainant organization maintains that the declaration of the strikes illegality by the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security of the province of Mendoza is null and void and constitutes an illegitimate manoeuvre by the State for the purpose of limiting the unions freedom of association. Its illegitimacy is based in the first place on the inadmissibility of the call for compulsory conciliation. It does not appear from the administrative proceedings that the trade union organization, in spite of questioning the new call for compulsory conciliation, failed to comply with it. The recourse it used, which is based on the exhaustion of that process, did not mean disobeying the competent authoritys orders in any way; the process has been used by the State as a tool for limiting the right of the union and its members to the legitimate exercise of the constitutional right to strike.
.Secondly, the Subsecretariat of Labour does not offer the guarantees of impartiality, independence and confidence of the parties that are required in order to act as conciliator in the industrial labour disputes to which the State is party.
.Thirdly, from the perspective of the conciliation process, a new call has no purpose other than to suppress the right to strike, especially considering the States lack of desire for conciliation which has lasted from  January  to the present. In these circumstances, it is inadmissible that a strike by health professionals of the provincial state should be declared illegal by virtue of a judicial ruling, which amounts to a denial of the constitutional right to strike.
.As regards the exhaustion of compulsory conciliation, the complainant organization states that the right to strike is one of the basic pillars of freedom of association recognized in the Constitution, and that it cannot be subject to restrictions with the appearance of legality. The manner in which the right to strike is recognized in article bis of the National Constitution warrants greater protection than other rights, according to national doctrine.
.In conclusion, the call for compulsory conciliation issued by Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security Resolution No. / is illegitimate and untimely, and its sole purpose is to prevent the legitimate exercise of the right to strike. In the light of the records of administrative proceedings, AMPROS never stopped complying with compulsory conciliation. The conciliation notice, as drafted, imposes a task that is impossible to fulfil because it is issued and executed once the direct action has been carried out, an action that would expire  hours and  minutes after notification of it has been given, according to report No. . Moreover, section  of Provincial Law No. , which regulates the right to strike, provides for a prior injunction to normalize activity within no more than hours, a period that was not taken into account; this directly contravenes the enjoyment and exercise of the right to strike.
.AMPROS reports that it lodged an appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) with the Seventh Labour Chamber of the first judicial district of the province of Mendoza in order to safeguard the rights which, in respect of the exercise of freedom of association, are allegedly being violated by the governmental authority. At that level of jurisdiction, the court ordered that the dispute be submitted to a mediation procedure which proved to be to no avail, as it ended in failure to achieve conciliation. Nevertheless, these negotiations carried an implicit warning from the Government of Mendoza that the trade union members and the union itself would be fined if no conciliatory agreement that satisfied its conditions was reached. In this connection, the Government proposed to revoke the declaration of illegality of the actions, subject to the abandonment of the proceedings at both the judicial and the administrative levels, as well as at the international level (in respect of the ILO), a position that is plainly coercive in its effect.
.In its communication of  November , FESPROSA states that the Government of the province of Crdoba is responsible, as in most Argentine states, for the provision of public health services through a network of institutions of increasing complexity (primary care centres and hospitals) and that these institutions are clustered in the provincial health system, in which , professional and non-professional employees work. FESPROSA alleges that, since the beginning of April, the workers, through first-level assemblies, began trade union actions, invoking ILO Conventions Nos  and , and, with the explicit endorsement of the Association of State Workers (ATE), demanded better wages and greater job security.
.The complainant organization states that, nonetheless, the Government of Crdoba declared the direct actions illegal and began systematically persecuting the workers. At the end of October, the Government docked up to  per cent of the wages of  workers who participated in the direct actions, and suspended another  strikers for one day, without entering into negotiations in good faith in order to settle the dispute.
.In its communication of  January , FESPROSA alleges that the Government of Santiago del Estero is violating ILO Conventions Nos  and . FESPROSA indicates that, in August , the Association of Health Professionals",3,2009,Argentina
152,"of Santiago del Estero Capital and La Banda (ASPROSSE), the Trade Union of Outreach Professionals (SIPARSE) and the FESPROSA delegations from the cities of Fras and Aatuya began trade union actions demanding a salary review and greater job security. FESPROSA asserts that the wages paid in the province are the lowest in the public health system nationwide. Of the , workers in the system, , are in precarious job situations. None of those , workers has an income equal to the minimum wage set by the National Wage and Employment Council, which is , Argentine pesos for January  (US$).
.The complainant organization adds that at no time during the course of the dispute did the Government agree to negotiate with the legitimate representatives of the workers, despite the repeated requests made by them with support from the National Federation. This situation still persists. Indeed, the provincial Government implemented repressive measures, such as: () the suspension for  days without pay, plus  days with pay, of DrGustavo Cceres, physician, Vice-President of SIPARSE and Director of the Hospital de Bandera Bajada. The suspension was extended without summary proceedings; () the dismissal of three trade unionists, Dr Teresa Santilln, Mr Juan C. Chazarreta, employee, and Ms Silvia Capellini, employee; and () the indiscriminate docking of wages, in amounts ranging from  to  pesos, of personnel who participated in the direct actions.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that Ms Nemesia Feiffer, a pharmacist and a delegate from the Hospital Independencia, was transferred in an untimely manner  kilometres from her home, and that six other professionals at the Hospital de Aatuya who were trade unionists and members of the hospitals FESPROSA delegation ?Dr Carlos E. Daz, surgeon; Dr Fernando Pedraza, paediatrician; Dr Matas Fernndez, general practitioner; Dr Sergio Alderete, obstetrician/gynaecologist; Valeria Pez, surgical technologist; and Jos Caete, anaesthesia technician ?were dismissed.
.In its communication of  May , FESPROSA alleges that a prolonged dispute in the province of Tucumn had reached a preliminary settlement in an agreement signed on November , but that the Government of Tucumn nonetheless defaulted on this agreement and issued Resolution No. /, which violates the right to strike by unilaterally declaring all health services to be essential services.
.In its communication of  August , AMPROS states that it is supplementing the complaint which gave rise to the case and alleges that, on  June , the Government of the province of Mendoza (Subsecretariat of Labour), with the obvious intention of persecuting the trade union, drew up a violation report against AMPROS, No.  (non-compliance with the call for compulsory conciliation), on account of incidents that had occurred more than a year earlier and had already been subject to sanctions (the declaration of the strike as illegal). The complainant adds that all of this is in clear violation of the principle non bis in dem?and due process. This means that the action in question, besides being tainted by gross defects which render it legally non-existent in the light of the National Constitution ?according to the complainant, under Law No. , fines of , to , pesos can be imposed for each worker affected by the infraction ?and the ILO Conventions, has a clearly threatening and intimidating objective and therefore blatantly violates freedom of association.
.According to AMPROS, the aim is simply to intimidate the union representatives in order to prevent them from properly defending the rights of their workers. In other words, and in sum, Violation Report No.  was drawn up on account of incidents that had already been subject to sanctions. That report, besides containing irremediable defects which render it null and void, was drawn up in a manner involving a clear abuse of authority.
.After Resolution No. / had been issued and report No. , ordering the union to comply with the conciliation decree, had been drawn up, AMPROS contested that measure. This proceeding was finally settled through the imposition of serious criminal and administrative punitive sanctions, such as declaring the strike illegal and notifying the national authority for the purposes of empowering it to request the judicial suspension or revocation of the trade unions legal personality, or to order its intervention (section , paragraph , of Law No. ); in the end, no sanction was imposed for the alleged non-compliance with Law No.  as the outcome of this proceeding. Trying to impose other sanctions more than a year and a half after these penalties were adopted, in respect of incidents for which AMPROS was served notice, under penalty of sanctions under Law No. , implicates a clear violation of the principle of non bis in dem?
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that, upon consultation with the Labour Ministry of the province of Mendoza, the Ministry transmitted a copy of the judgment handed down in the case captioned AMPROS, Mendoza Association v. Government of the province of Mendoza, for amparo [constitutional protection]? report No.  of  December . The judgment denies the trade union constitutional protection and dismisses the action on grounds of unfair practice, rejecting any violation of the right to strike by the Government of the Mendoza province (the text of the judgment indicates that the strike was illegal because it failed to comply with the provision concerning minimum services, that the conciliation procedure was not exhausted, and that there was no requirement to return the deductions for the strike days). This judgment has been appealed, and therefore it is deemed appropriate to await the decision of the provincial court, a matter on which the Committee will be kept informed.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states, with regard to the allegations concerning the province of Crdoba, that upon consultation with the Secretariat of Labour of the province, the Secretariat replied that the action and intervention of the provincial labour authority were recorded under cases Nos -/ and
.The provincial authority adds that FESPROSA did not appear in any proceeding in the dispute, nor did it confirm the scope of its representative capacity. That is, it did not participate in different administrative proceedings, and did not intervene or take part in the negotiation or request any formal participation. It did not comply with compulsory conciliation, nor did it agree to the different negotiating phases, in contrast to the two trade unions with legal personality, with which an agreement was finally reached.
.Lastly, the Government states that the analysis of the complaint should be reconsidered, bearing in mind that, on the basis of the facts and the law, the negotiation was conducted with two trade unions operating in the province of Crdoba with sufficient legal personality to represent the workers affiliated with them, both of which negotiated and reached an agreement with their employer, and that neither of them complained; FESPROSA, however, did so independently, having appeared in the dispute almost at the last minute and with no authority to act in the province of Crdoba.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, AMPROS alleges that, following a work stoppage in the health sector of the province of Mendoza on  October , the strikers?pay was docked, and that after two stoppages on  and  April , the administrative authority called for compulsory conciliation in an untimely and inadmissible manner, and finally declared the direct action illegal for having failed to comply with the conciliation procedure (according to AMPROS, in June , the Subsecretariat of Labour of the province of Mendoza drew up a violation report in this regard, and a fine could be imposed). For its part, FESPROSA alleges that: () in the province of Crdoba, after the health sector workers began to carry out trade union actions, the actions were declared illegal on  October , up to  per cent of the strikers?pay was docked, and strikers were suspended; () in the province of Santiago del Estero, the health sector workers began to carry out trade union actions in August , the provincial Government did not agree to negotiate and, in retaliation, suspended the physician Vice-President of SIPARSE, dismissed nine trade unionists, transferred a trade union delegate, and docked the wages of employees who participated in the direct actions; and () in the province of Tucumn, the provincial Government issued Resolution No. /, which violates the right to strike by declaring all health services to be essential services.
.The Committee notes that the Government reports that: () with regard to the allegations by AMPROS concerning the province of Mendoza, the administrative authority of the province of Mendoza reported that the judgment rendered by the judicial authority in the case AMPROS, Mendoza Association v. Government of the province of Mendoza for amparo?concluded that the strike was illegal because it failed to comply with the rules concerning minimum services, that the right to strike was not violated, that the conciliation procedure was not exhausted and that there was no requirement to return the wages deducted for strike days; the Government adds that, bearing in mind that an appeal has been lodged against",0,2009,Argentina
153,"this judgment, it deems it appropriate to await the decision of the provincial judicial body; and () with regard to FESPROSAs allegations concerning the province of Crdoba, the labour administrative authority of that province reported that, within the framework of the dispute in the health sector, the compulsory conciliation process was opened, and the Trade Union of Public Employees and the Association of Health Workers (which are endowed with legal personality, the status of more representative organizations) accepted the effects of conciliation, and only recently did FESPROSA appear in that proceeding, rejecting the measure ?without attaching documentation confirming its simple registration and/or legal personality. The provincial Government adds that FESPROSA did not appear in any other proceedings in the dispute, did not confirm its representative capacity, did not participate in the negotiation and did not comply with compulsory conciliation, nor did it participate in the various negotiating phases, in contrast to the other organizations with legal personality, with which an agreement was reached.
.The Committee observes, first, that the disputes which gave rise to work stoppages and trade union actions and to calls for compulsory conciliation occurred in the health sector, and that, in Argentina, workers in the health sector may exercise the right to strike, subject to the performance of minimum services. The Committee recalls that when establishing a minimum service in the event of a strike in an essential service in the strict sense of the term not only the public authorities, but also the organizations of workers and employers concerned should be able to participate in such a determination.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the calls for compulsory conciliation in the context of collective disputes, the Committee recalls that it has stated on earlier occasions that Legislation which provides for voluntary conciliation and arbitration in collective disputes before a strike may be called cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association?and that In general, a decision to suspend a strike for a reasonable period so as to allow the parties to seek a negotiated solution through mediation or conciliation efforts, does not in itself constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras ?]. This is particularly valid when essential services in the strict sense of the term are concerned. Moreover, as regards the allegations concerning the docking of wages for the strike days (which the organizations, in their complaints, consider illegitimate), the Committee underlines that Salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles?[see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.As regards the allegations concerning the sanctions that could have been or have been imposed in the context of disputes with health sector workers (AMPROS alleges that a fine could have been imposed for not complying with the call for compulsory conciliation; FESPROSA alleges the suspension of  strikers in the province of Crdoba, as well as the suspension of the physician Vice-President of SIPARSE, the dismissal of six trade unionists and the transfer of a trade union delegate in the province of Santiago del Estero), the Committee notes that the Government reports that judicial proceedings are under way in connection with the allegations presented by AMPROS. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the judgment rendered in this case. With regard to the sanctions alleged by FESPROSA, the Committee has not been informed whether the penalized workers have initiated judicial proceedings in connection with the sanctions imposed, or of the possible grounds for those sanctions. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to clarify whether these workers have lodged appeals before the courts and, if so, to keep it informed of the outcome. In addition, the Committee invites the complainant to provide any additional information it considers necessary in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the judgement that is handed down in connection with the allegations concerning the possibility of a sanction being imposed on AMPROS for not complying with a call for compulsory conciliation.(b) As regards the allegations by FESPROSA concerning sanctions against certain trade unionists (the suspension of  strikers in the province of Crdoba, as well as the suspension of the physician Vice-President of SIPARSE, the dismissal of nine trade unionists and the transfer of a trade union delegate in the province of Santiago del Estero), the Committee has not been informed whether the penalized workers have instituted judicial proceedings in connection with the sanctions imposed, or of the possible grounds for those sanctions. In these conditions, the Committee requests the Government to clarify whether these workers have lodged appeals before the courts and, if so, to keep it informed of the outcome. In addition, the Committee invites the complainant to provide any additional information it considers necessary in this regard.",0,2009,Argentina
154,".The Committee examined this case (in which it was alleged that the authorities of the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund decided not to deduct union dues for trade union members, or to provide office accommodation for the conduct of trade union activities, or to allow workers to hold assemblies, while suspending a delegate of the Association of State Workers (ATE), Ms Mara Elena Villalba, for  days, and that the town council of Corrientes ruled in Resolution No.  of  October , to withdraw the check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues from union members?wages) at its March  meeting on which occasion it made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way initiated by the ATE against the town council of Corrientes, to which the Government refers.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund and the town council of Corrientes deduct and submit to the ATE the trade union dues of its members, in accordance with its certificate (MTSS Resolution No./) issued by the Ministry of Labour. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In a communication of  August , the Government states that: () the judicial proceedings in question are ongoing before Labour Court No.  of the city of Corrientes; and () the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund stated that the respective dues are being deducted from the wages of the members of the various trade unions and deposited within the first ten days following the payment of wages.
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings regarding the case in question before Labour Court No.  of the city of Corrientes. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures adopted to ensure that the town council of Corrientes deducts and submits to the ATE the trade union dues of its members, in accordance with its certificate (MTSS Resolution No. /) issued by the Ministry of Labour.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of State Workers (ATE) dated May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of May , ATE states that it is presenting a complaint against the Government of Argentina for the violation of Conventions Nos  and  because of unfair practice, discrimination and reprisals against both workers and the ATE on the grounds of trade union participation by the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund and the town council of Corrientes, in the province of Corrientes. The ATE states that despite Argentina having ratified ILO Conventions Nos  and , article bis of the Argentine Constitution guaranteeing workers the free and democratic right to organize, the second paragraph of article , subsection , of the Constitution according constitutional status to a series of international human rights treaties; the first paragraph of article , subsection , of the Constitution granting legal precedence to other international treaties, including ILO Conventions, the Government engaged in the systematic violation of freedom of association.
.The ATE states that, the complaint concerns the following violations: (a) the financial controller of the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund engaged in systematic violation of freedom of association and in discrimination against the organizations trade union rights by not granting a check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues, failing to provide office accommodation for the conduct of trade union activities and not allowing workers to exercise the fundamental rights of holding assemblies, electing delegates, and so on; (b)there has been a tendency to persecute and take reprisals against representatives of the workers of the ATE; and (c) the mayor of the town council of Corrientes ordered an act prejudicial to freedom of association by withdrawing the check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues from the ATE.
.The ATE notes that it has official trade union status No.  and is authorized to operate throughout Argentina and, consequently, in the town council of Corrientes, as well as in the autonomous agency under its authority, the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund. However, the ATE is prevented from fully carrying out its trade union activities, both at the town council of Corrientes and at the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund, as its scope of activity and all the rights that flow automatically and naturally from its representation are not recognized (articles ,  et seq. of Act No. ). The ATE adds that this situation is exacerbated by the persecution suffered by one of the delegates, Mara Elena Villalba, a workers?representative, who works at the Municipal Loan Fund.
.The ATE alleges that the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund, when requested to grant the corresponding check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues, stated that, according to the terms of Corrientes Municipal Ordinance No. /, the only bodies recognized for this purpose are the Association of Municipal Workers and Employees of Corrientes (AOEM), the Federation of Corrientes Municipal Workers?Unions (FESTRAMCO) and the Confederation of Municipal Workers and Employees of Argentina (COEMA), and not the ATE. Following this response, the ATE appealed to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MTSS) to rule on the scope of activity of the ATE and its applicability at the town council of Corrientes and at the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund. The Ministry of Labour granted a certificate ?established in MTSS resolution No./ ?ruling that union dues should be deducted from ATE members, in accordance with article  of Decree No. / and article  of Act No.  concerning trade union associations. On  August , the implementing authority issued the corresponding certificate, which was submitted to the Corrientes Municipal Fund on September , together with National Trade Union Associations Directorate provision No. /, which establishes the deduction of trade union dues as an obligation for employers.
.Nevertheless, and before transferring to another trade union organization, the Municipal Loan Fund stated that it is an autonomous and independent entity that is governed according to Ordinance No. /, and that the provisions of the Ministry of Labour do not apply to it. Article  provides that: Personnel are entitled to form unions and to organize, in accordance with the applicable legislation. This statute recognizes the Association of Municipal Workers and Employees of Corrientes (AOEM), the Federation of Corrientes Municipal Workers?Unions (FESTRAMCO) and the Confederation of Municipal Workers and Employees of Argentina (COEMA), trade unions of first, second and third levels, respectively, pursuant to the modalities provided for in article  of ActNo. , as sole trade union representatives of the workers of the town council of the city of Corrientes??that on this basis and adherence to the whole by the Municipal Loan Fund through the provisions of resolution No.  of  May , which makes all the agents of that institution subject to the Single Statute for the personnel of the town council of the city of Corrientes (Ordinance No. /), the Municipal Loan Fund, like the town council, only recognizes the trade union associations described in article  of the rules cited?
.The ATE indicates that this is the reason why the check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues for ATE members is not authorized, as provided in article  of Act No. , article  of Ordinance No. / and resolution No. / of the Municipal Loan Fund. According to the ATE, while the Municipal Loan Fund of the municipality of Corrientes did not grant the requested check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues, the town council of Corrientes had been deducting the union dues for the organization for over eight years. Despite such recognition, on  October , the town council issued resolution No.  withdrawing the check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues from the ATE on the basis of the abovementioned ordinance. Given this situation, and as there is no other trade union body with official trade union status at the town council of Corrientes, the implementing authority was once again asked to rule on whether this association has official trade union status, whether its rights as a legal entity are applicable in the municipality of Corrientes and whether the rights established in Act No.  are accorded to it as it has official trade union status.
.On  October , the Ministry of Labour handed down a ruling stating that the ATE is a first-level trade union with official trade union status (registered as No. ) with the exclusive powers indicated in article  and related provisions of Act No.  and with representative capacity within the town council of Corrientes. It is also noted that there is no record of any displacement of the representative status of",-1,2009,Argentina
155,"the ATE by another trade union organization? The town council was again made aware of the implementing authoritys declaration, but it was not favourably received. The ATE alleges that the continued failure to recognize it constitutes systematic persecution of the affiliated workers and of their representatives.
.According to the ATE, on  June , Mara Elena Villalba was appointed normalizing delegate of the Municipal Loan Fund, in accordance with the provisions of the statutes of the organization, and her mandate to occupy the same position was extended by  more days on  August . On  October , an election of delegates was held at the Municipal Loan Fund, and Mara Elena Villalba was elected. The employer was notified of this in due time, but refused to recognize her activity or position. Not only was Mara Elena Villalbas position as delegate not recognized, but resolution No. /, issued by the Municipal Loan Fund, ordered that she be laid off for a period of six months, extendable, together with all the other workers in the treasury sector.
.The ATE states that, while that resolution was not enforced, other actions were carried out against the workers?organization. Memorandums were issued prohibiting workers from meeting or attempting to assemble or organize, timetables were altered, transfers were carried out and workers were intimidated. Furthermore, on  September , the delegate Mara Elena Villalba was sanctioned under resolution No. /, being suspended for  calendar days and having administrative proceedings brought against her for the purpose of imposing further sanctions, simply for being a normalizing delegate and having attended in that capacity the conciliation hearing on  September  to which she had been summoned by the labour directorate of the province of Corrientes.
.The complainant organization indicates that the employers main argument for refusing to recognize the ATE revolves around Municipal Ordinance No.  of , mentioned above, article  of which recognizes that the AOEM, FESTRAMCO, and COEMA, as sole workers?representatives at the town council of the city of Corrientes. Not only do these arguments ignore and violate national regulatory provisions, but it is also important to mention, in this specific case, that there are no administrative or judicial resolutions excluding the ATE from the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund.
.The ATE states that the limits and scope of the principle and fundamental right of freedom of association, embodied in rules with constitutional status and legal precedence, are a federal matter, by rule of the devolution practiced in favour of the State. Consequently, provinces and municipalities are prohibited from legislating on aspects that are inherent to the organization and functioning of trade union organizations. But, despite this, the town council of the city of Corrientes mistakenly argues for, establishes and insists upon the monopoly of the AOEM. Also, the ATE maintains, according to Act No., the refusal to recognize it lacks any real or legal basis, given that the Ministry of Labours records show that the AOME has merely been registered and does not have official trade union status.
.The so-called trade union monopoly implies an attempt at compulsory affiliation to a trade union with the exclusion of others. This violates article bis of the Constitution, by seeking to limit free and democratic organization? and ILO Conventions Nos  and . The actions of the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund and the town council of Corrientes constitute anti-union activity because the employer is the same in both cases. The ATE alleges that the employers actions can be divided into the following three anti-union actions: (a) establishing a trade union monopoly, failing to recognize and discriminating against the ATE by not granting it a check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues at the Municipal Loan Fund and, after eight years of recognition, stopping deductions at the town council of Corrientes; (b) failing to recognize the trade union representation status of the delegate Mara Elena Villalba, elected by the workers of the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund, and persecuting and intimidating her; and (c) prohibiting the fundamental rights of workers, such as the right to hold assemblies.
.The complainant organization refers to a letter dated  October , endorsed by the representative of the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund which, in its view, details the mistaken and illegal belief held by that body, seeking to establish a trade union monopoly. The text is as follows:?the exchange of opinions does not achieve any result. The town council of Corrientes and its autonomous body the Municipal Loan Fund is governed by Ordinance No. /, article , which provides that sole trade unions authorized in the public employment relationship are the Association of Municipal Workers and Employees of Corrientes (AOEM), domiciled at calle la Rioja , Corrientes, the Federation of Corrientes Municipal Workers?Unions (FESTRAMCO), domiciled at Avenida  de abril , Corrientes, and the Confederation of Municipal Workers and Employees of Argentina (COEMA), current and compulsory standards (within the framework of its competence) and rights reserved (article  of the Constitution). Reinforced by article  of the Constitution, the municipality is enjoying full autonomy. This ordinance was imposed by the federal Government through federal intervention (article  of the Constitution). The trade unions mentioned have almost all the unionized municipal employees, which makes the ATEs claim invalid, and as such we dismiss the claim of a trade union that has neither a territorial nor an occupational connection to the Municipal Loan Fund. While this is in force, employees are subject to the abovementioned ordinance, freely and voluntarily (theory of individual action). As to Mara Elena Villalba, the proceedings instituted relate to other causes and we deny any type of persecution ?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The ATE indicates that before Ordinance No. / came into force it was recognized by the town council of Corrientes, which deducted the union dues from members until November , adding to the above argument concerning the monopoly established by the ordinance used by the autonomous body of the municipality. It is the ATEs understanding that the actions of the administration in respect of the check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues, in addition to the express prohibition to exercise fundamental rights, shows a clear attitude of discrimination that is contrary to the spirit of the domestic and international legislation mentioned above.
.The lack of recognition is compounded by the harassment against the delegate mentioned, proof of which is the result of the administrative proceedings ordered by resolution No./, with an excessive, unfounded and arbitrary sanction consisting of  days?suspension. This worker, therefore, had her wages deducted as a result of her trade union activities, with a very severe sanction clearly intended to thwart any attempt by workers to organize in the defence of their interests. On  August , and in compliance with a mandate from the workers of the Municipal Loan Fund, the ATE requested the intervention of the Undersecretariat of Labour of the province of Corrientes, asking it to initiate a conciliation process with the employer to solve the collective labour dispute caused by laying off all the personnel in the treasury sector, where the delegate works. The first hearing of that conciliation process was held at the headquarters of the Undersecretariat of Labour, in the presence of representatives of the Municipal Loan Fund, and the director of work called for a recess. The ATE delegate agreed. The second hearing was scheduled for  September  by means of a writ of notification from the executive council for the province of Corrientes, and the delegate again requested an exemption in order to attend the hearing together with confirmation from the SecretaryGeneral of the ATE. This time the exemption was refused, but Mara Elena Villalba attended all the same, and, in any case, she was exercising her rights under the principle of freedom of association, attending the hearing in defence of the workers. The employer then sanctioned her for attending the hearing, although she had previously requested an exemption and had informed the employer of her absence from her place of work, which, furthermore, had been approved for the first hearing without any type of objection.
.The ATE indicates that resolution No. / set aside the order to lay off all the workers in the treasury sector of the Municipal Loan Fund of the city of Corrientes. To sanction her for this is clearly an example of trade union persecution, which, in addition to the serious financial and personal damage that she has suffered, certainly also hampers her trade union representation duties.
.The ATE indicates that the terms of letter No.  of  October , signed by the representative of the Municipal Loan Fund, reveal the illegal position held by that body, namely: ?I notify you specifically, reiterating our earlier letter in view of the fact that it appears that you do not read the texts, that it is totally and absolutely prohibited to hold any type of meeting of a religious, political or trade union nature inside the institution, and persons who pursue such objectives will be prevented from entering by the",-1,2009,Argentina
156,"police. The town council of Corrientes and the Municipal Loan Fund are governed by Ordinance No./, articles  and  ?which I advise you to read ?which provide that the AOEM, FESTRAMCO and COEMA are sole trade unions authorized in public employment relationships. The trade unions mentioned exclude the ATE in compliance with prevailing legislation. Employees subject to the Ordinance ? According to the ATE, the writ of notification from the Municipal Loan Fund shows that all the personnel were notified that any type of trade union act is prohibited within the Municipal Loan Fund without the due authorization of the institutions authorities?
.On this matter, it is recalled once again that national regulations, as well as specific constitutional and international guarantees, guarantee freedom of association and, more specifically, article  of Act No.  establishes that trade unions, once they are registered, are entitled to hold meetings and assemblies without the need for prior authorization? To summarize, the ATE claims that the State of Argentina, through the town council of Corrientes and the Municipal Loan Fund of Corrientes, has systematically violated the fundamental collective and trade union rights of workers.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that it consulted the Undersecretariat of Labour of the province of Corrientes and was informed that, in provision No.  of  October , a conciliation hearing was scheduled for October , which did not go ahead due to the failure of the parties to appear. Furthermore, it indicates that the ATE has not taken any action in respect of the administrative proceedings since November .
.The provincial authority states that, at the beginning of , the trade union organization made an application before the ordinary courts of the city of Corrientes, initiating judicial proceedings No.  entitled Precautionary measure, Association of State Workers (ATE) v. Town council of the city of Corrientes and others concerning appeal for the protection of constitutional trade union rights? It also notes that the relevant part of judicial resolution No. , dated  June , orders: () the suspension of any act by the Municipal Loan Fund that constitutes an obstacle to the ATE in the exercise of its trade union activities; and () that the exceptional precautionary measure be allowed, setting aside the suspension of Mara Elena Villalba for  days. The Government indicates that having channelled the claims through the appropriate judicial body and having abandoned the administrative route pursued initially, it considers that the result of the judicial proceedings should now be awaited.
.The Committee observes that, in this case, the complainant organization alleges that, in violation of its trade union rights, the authorities of the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund decided not to deduct the union dues of its members, failed to provide the trade union with an office space, did not allow assemblies to be held and sanctioned with a suspension of days the ATE delegate, Mara Elena Villalba, under resolution No./ for having attended, in her capacity as delegate, a conciliation hearing to which she had been summoned by the Labour Directorate of the Province of Corrientes. The ATE also alleges that the authorities of the municipality of Corrientes ruled in resolution No.  of October , to withdraw the check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues from union members (according to the complainant organization, the town council had been deducting union dues for ATE members for over eight years).
.The Committee notes the Governments information that it consulted the Subsecretariat of Labour of the Province of Corrientes, which informed it that: () in provision No.  of  October , a conciliation hearing was scheduled for  October , which did not go ahead due to the failure of the parties to appear and that the ATE had not taken any action in respect of the administrative proceedings since November ; () at the beginning of  the trade union organization made an application to the courts, initiating judicial proceedings No.  entitled Association of State Workers (ATE) v.Town council of the city of Corrientes concerning appeal for the protection of constitutional trade union rights? and () judicial resolution No.  of  June  ordered the suspension of any act by the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund that constitutes an obstacle to the ATE in the exercise of its trade union activities, which gave rise to a precautionary measure, setting aside the suspension for  days of Mara Elena Villalba. Finally, the Committee notes the Governments indication that, having channelled the claims of the complainant organization to the appropriate judicial body and having abandoned the administrative route, it considers that the result of the judicial proceedings should now be awaited.
.The Committee takes due note of the intervention of the judicial authorities in respect of the allegations and, in particular, the provision that all acts that constitute obstacles to the ATEs trade union activities be suspended and that they cancelled the suspension of the trade union delegate Mara Elena Villalba. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way.
.With respect to the alleged refusal to deduct union dues from ATE members at the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund and at the town council of Corrientes (at the latter institution, the deduction had been made for eight years, according to the complainants), the Committee cannot determine, from the Governments reply, whether the judicial action under way has given rise to any measures relating to these allegations. The Committee observes the complainant organizations statement that the Ministry of Labour granted a certificate (MTSS resolution No. /) ruling, in application of the Act on trade unions, that trade union dues be deducted from ATE members in the context in question. The Committee observes that neither the Government nor the municipal authorities have denied these statements. The Committee recalls that depriving trade union organizations of the trade union dues of their members can cause them considerable financial difficulties and, consequently, serious operational difficulties; also, it is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations. This being the case, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund and the town council of Corrientes deduct and submit to the ATE the trade union dues of its members. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way initiated by the ATE against the town council of Corrientes, to which the Government refers.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the Corrientes Municipal Loan Fund and the town council of Corrientes deduct and submit to the ATE the trade union dues of its members, in accordance with its certificate (MTSS resolution No. /) issued by the Ministry of Labour. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",0,2009,Argentina

.In its communications of  May and  October  the Government states, in response to the Committees requests, that investigations into the alleged anti-union practices of the Toledo SA Supermarkets are being conducted by the judiciary, which is the body responsible for investigating the resolving disputes between private parties and which, once it has completed its enquiries, will determine whether any action needs to betaken and hand down its ruling accordingly.

.The Committee recalls that in the present case the complainant alleges acts of discrimination and, specifically, the anti-union dismissal of  trade unionists and a trade union officer by Toledo SA Supermarkets and the use of force against strikers, leaving seven injured. When it examined the case previously [rd Report, para. ], the Committee urged the Government to: () conduct the requested investigation immediately into all the allegations of anti-union dismissals ( trade union members and one union officer according to the complainant,  workers according to the company) and to keep it informed in this regard; () inform it whether the dismissed workers, including trade union officer Mr Rubn scar Godoy, have taken legal action; and () conduct an investigation into the allegation that on  April , the day of the strike, the police made use of force against the striking workers, leaving seven injured (one of them, Mr Jos Lagos, seriously injured), and send information on the outcome of the investigation as well as on the outcome of the complaints against these acts filed with the Public Prosecutors Office in Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province.
.Regarding the alleged anti-union dismissals, the Committee takes note of the Governments statement that: () three of the workers lodged an appeal for court protection of trade union rights, three lodged an appeal for court protection against dismissal and two lodged an appeal for court protection in respect of a wage dispute; and () the judicial enquiries are still ongoing,. The Committee, which understands from the Governments statement that only eight workers lodged complaints with the judiciary, expresses the firm hope that the judicial authority will very soon hand down its ruling and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome.
.Regarding the allegation that on  April , the day of the strike, the police made use of force against the striking workers, leaving seven of them injured, the Committee notes the Governments statement that the Public Prosecutors Office of the Department of Justice in Mar del Plata decided to file complaint No.  lodged by Mr Borda in respect of the infliction of grievous bodily harm, without further action. In this regard, the Committee regrets the long delay between the termination of the investigation in  and the submission of the information by the Government only in . Also, given that the Government does not deny that in the framework of the strike action, the police made use of force against the striking workers, leaving some of them seriously injured, the Committee recalls that the authorities should resort to calling in the police only if there is a genuine threat to public order, and that the intervention of the police should be proportionate to the threat to public order.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee expresses the firm hope that the judicial authority will very soon hand down its ruling in respect of the dismissal of trade union officers and union members and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the rulings that are handed down.

Furthermore, while noting the companys statement that the judicial authority rejected an amparo appeal filed by the representatives of the union being established, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether the dismissed workers, including trade union officer Mr Rubn scar Godoy, have taken legal action. In addition, the Committee invites the CTA to forward any additional information.(b)	As regards the allegation that on  April , the day of the strike, the police used force against the strikers, leaving seven injured (one of them, Mr Jos Lagos, seriously), the Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that an investigation is launched into this matter, to send information on its outcome and to send information on the outcome of the complaints against these acts filed with the Public Prosecutors Office of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province.
.In its communication dated  November , the Government sends the reply from the administrative authority of Buenos Aires Province (hereinafter referred to as the provincial authority). The provincial authority states that the complainant organization considered that a judicial situation has arisen that is prejudicial to the workers, who consider that it constitutes a failure to comply with internationally accepted principles which, inasmuch as they have been incorporated into Argentinas own legislation, guarantee freedom of association and the right to strike. Nevertheless, in the opinion of the provincial authority, the complainant organization has failed, in its complaint, to identify any specific action taken by Buenos Aires Province that might have violated freedom of association, and the provincial Ministry of Labour intervened within the limits of its own powers of conciliation and restoration of social peace.
.The provincial authority outlines the facts set forth in previous examinations of the case. It also states that it intervened in the dispute involving the Supermercados Toledo SA enterprise as soon as it was informed of it through a complaint lodged by the workers and the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA). It emphasizes the important role played by the provincial",-1,2009,Argentina
158,"labour authority, which offered the parties a conciliation procedure, summoned them to conciliation hearings, and constantly sought a peaceful settlement to the dispute.
.The provincial authority adds that in this context, the intervention by Ministry of Labour of Buenos Aires Province had a positive effect from the complainant organizations point of view since it led to an administrative procedure that provided an opportunity for dialogue within the framework established by law. It was a lawful and appropriate intervention, within the limits of the powers of the body to which the party had appealed; this does not preclude any intervention at the national level by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which is the authority responsible for enforcing Act No. , and before which the parties could have filed their complaints.
.The provincial authority points out that, notwithstanding the above, the dispute lay outside the competence of the provincial Ministry of Labour, since the complaint referred to unfair practices, applicability issues and violations of trade union rights ?matters which should be resolved at the national level by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which is the authority responsible for enforcing Act No. , and/or the judiciary. That being so, and given the fact that the employer party had repeatedly declined to take part in the procedure, and that the dispute involved issues in respect of which the provincial labour authority was not competent to intervene, the provincial Ministry of Labour merely organized the abovementioned hearings and attempted to reach a peaceful settlement between the parties.
.According to the provincial authority, it is clear from the above that credence should not be given to the suggestion that the Government was reluctant to exercise its legislative capacity as the body responsible for guaranteeing the minimum rights of freedom of association contained in ILO Conventions Nos  and . As described above, freedom of association is guaranteed, and any discrimination sanctioned, by the legislative framework in force ?articles bis,  and () of the National Constitution; and Acts Nos  and . Furthermore, it states that Act No.  applies, under article bis of the National Constitution, and in accordance with ILO doctrine, the mechanisms of state control and regulation do not in any way restrict the powers inherent in freedom of association, since they provide objective and predetermined criteria serving to prevent rights abuses and promote collective bargaining. The provincial authority states that national legislation provides sufficient guarantees for the exercise of freedom of association and that the complainant had the opportunity to apply for judicial review of the dismissals ordered by the employer, and for enforcement of the applicable statutory penalties.
.The provincial authority recalls that the Argentine legal system guarantees the freedom to establish trade unions without prior authorization.
.The Committee recalls that in the present case the complainant organization alleged acts of discrimination, specifically the anti-union dismissal of  trade union members and one trade union officer in the Supermercados Toledo SA enterprise. It further alleged that the police had used force against the strikers and seven persons had been injured. In its previous examination of the case, the Committee urged the Government to conduct the requested investigation immediately into all the allegations of discrimination and anti union dismissals; it also requested the Government to inform it whether the dismissed workers, including trade union officer Mr Rubn scar Godoy, had taken legal action. Furthermore, it urged the Government to take steps to ensure that an investigation was launched into the use of force by police against the strikers (leaving seven injured, one of them seriously).
.The Committee observes that the Government has sent the reply from the administrative authority of Buenos Aires Province. In this regard, the Committee notes that the provincial authority states that: () it intervened in the dispute between the enterprise and the complainant when it was informed of the complaint lodged by the workers and the CTA, and offered the parties a conciliation procedure; () it summoned them to conciliation hearings and constantly sought a peaceful settlement to the dispute; () the intervention had a positive effect since it led to an administrative procedure that provided an opportunity for dialogue; () the dispute lay outside the competence of the provincial labour authority, since the complaint referred to unfair practices, applicability issues and violations of trade union rights ?matters which should be resolved at the national level by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and/or the judiciary; () given that the employer party had declined to take part in the dialogue procedure, and that the dispute involved issues outside the remit of the provincial labour authority, it confined itself to holding the abovementioned hearings and attempting to reach a peaceful settlement between the parties; and () freedom of association is guaranteed and any discrimination was sanctioned by the National Constitution and Acts Nos  and .
.While noting the observations of the provincial administrative authority (particularly in so far as they relate to its intervention in the dispute, which involved complaints of violations of trade union rights, with a view to offering a conciliation procedure), the Committee regrets that the Government has failed to report on the specifically requested investigations or transmit the requested information. In these circumstances, the Committee once again urges the Government to: () conduct the requested investigation immediately into all the allegations of anti-union dismissals ( trade union members and one union officer according to the complainant;  workers according to the company) and to keep it informed in this regard; () inform it whether the dismissed workers, including trade union officer Mr Rubn scar Godoy, have taken legal action; and ()conduct an investigation into the allegation that on  April , the day of the strike, the police used force against the strikers, leaving seven injured (one of them, Mr Jos Lagos, seriously), and send information on the outcome of the investigation as well as on the outcome of the complaints against these acts filed with the Public Prosecutors Office in Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province.
.In the light of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee once again urges the Government to: () conduct the requested investigation immediately into all the allegations of anti-union dismissals in the Supermercados Toledo SA enterprise ( trade union members and one union officer according to the complainant;  workers according to the company) and to keep it informed in this regard; () inform it whether the dismissed workers, including trade union officer Mr Rubn scar Godoy, have taken legal action; and () conduct an investigation into the allegation that on  April , the day of the strike, the police used force against the strikers, leaving seven injured (one of them, Mr Jos Lagos, seriously), and send information on the outcome of the investigation as well as on the outcome of the complaints against these acts filed with the Public Prosecutors Office of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province.
.The Committee last examined this case at its MayJune  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ?, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that, as part of its examination of this case in June , it asked the Government: () to carry out an investigation without delay into all the facts of discrimination and interference mentioned in the complaint, to determine the reasons for the dismissal of trade union officer Mr Rubn scar Godoy and other union members (altogether) employed by the Supermercados Toledo SA company after holding a strike and, if the above acts proved to be based on anti-union motives, to take steps to bring the parties together with a view to reinstating the dismissed workers (the Committee asked the Government to inform it whether those adversely affected had taken legal action in this respect) and ()with regard to the allegation that on  April , the day of the strike, the police used force against the strikers, leaving seven injured (one of them, Mr Jos Lagos, seriously), to take the necessary steps to ensure that an investigation was carried out by an authority independent from those involved, and to inform it of the outcome (the Committee asked the Government to inform it of the outcome of the complaints filed by the trade union against those acts with the Public Prosecutors Office of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province).
.The Committee observes the complainants allegation in the present case that once the company became aware that the administrative procedure had started for official registration of the Trade Union of Poultry Slaughtering and Processing Plant and Allied Workers, it began to harass the union leaders and members and that, following a strike which",-1,2009,Argentina
159,"had arisen as a result of various demands being ignored, the company, in an anti-union climate and interference, dismissed trade union officer MrRubn scar Godoy and another  union members. At the same time, the Committee observes that the complainant alleges that on  April , the day of the strike, the police used force against the strikers, leaving seven injured (one of them, Mr Jos Lagos, seriously) and the unions lawyers filed complaints relating to these events with the Public Prosecutors Office of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province.
.The Committee observes that the Government has sent the reply from the company concerned relating to the allegations made in this case.
.As regards the acts of discrimination and interference mentioned in the complaint which supposedly motivated the dismissal of trade union officer (Mr Rubn scar Godoy) and another  union members following a strike, the Committee notes the companys statement that: () on  March a collective agreement was signed with the Trade Union of Commercial Employees of the Atlantic Zone (SECZA) representative trade union, awarding improved benefits; () after the agreement was signed, a series of actions took place which had nothing to do with labour or trade union activity at the workplace concerned; () on  April  a group of workers from the morning shift decided to stop working, occupying?the works canteen, denying people entry, claiming to belong to the executive committee of a non-existent trade union and practically obliging their colleagues to also stop work and remain on the spot; () having been sent by the company, the human resources manager informed the workers that if there was any disagreement over payments or any particular problem or grievance, he proposed to deal with them one by one until they were resolved. This was rejected by the group in question, which included Mr Rubn Godoy, who had been the defeated candidate in the elections held at the workplace by one of the trade unions (foodstuffs) and was now the self-proclaimed leader?of the non-existent union; () five hours after the canteen had been occupied? the workers were asked to resume their work on threat of dismissal, an instruction which was ignored (subsequently, with the entry of the afternoon shift, a small group remained on the spot to ensure that the workers on the new shift adopted the same attitude, forcing most of them into an attitude which they were evidently reluctant to adopt); ()consequently, having established that there had been several serious instances of labour non-compliance, such as: refusal to perform company duties without any justification, unlawful occupation of the works canteen, incitement of colleagues to adopt the same attitude, including those on a different (afternoon) shift, and remaining at the plant outside?working hours in order to prolong the occupation, the company considered that misconduct as defined in section  of the Employment Contract Act (LCT) had occurred and dismissed  workers on justified grounds; () although attempts were made initially to reach some kind of negotiated solution, this was not possible owing to a series of violent actions directed not only at the plant itself but also at various branches of the company by the dismissed workers with the participation of a number of outsiders; () from the moment they became aware of the situation, representative trade unions (SECZA and the Trade Union of Foodstuff Industry Workers of Buenos Aires Province (STIABA)) and the Ministry of Labour of Buenos Aires Province, a hearing was held on  April , when ?something vitally important to this presentation ?the representatives of both trade unions stated that they had nothing to do with the dispute and the demands submitted (SECZA and STIABA are both vying for representation of the workers); () following the dismissal, various attempts were made through different interlocutors to converse with the dismissed staff, but on each occasion they all refused to participate in any talks, stating that they would only act through their lawyers. Thereupon the dismissed workers plus a number of other employees and various persons not employed by the company and having no connection with it (for example, political activists who had also taken part in other disputes in the zone? occupied the entrance to the industrial estate, preventing the entry or exit of people, transport and/or goods, especially those intended for the company; ()in the present case there was no strike and/or industrial action declared in accordance with the terms of the law, and even the labour authorities (provincial and national ministries of labour) did not accept that this was a collective dispute and therefore refused the request for compulsory conciliation, accepting the companys straightforward refusal of procedure? () the complainant organization has sought to validate?the existence of a trade union, the existence of anti-union activity and the existence of a collective dispute. The registration procedure and the claimed affiliation to a multi-activity organization without trade union status, such as the CTA, do not change its status since a union in the process of registration is not considered a trade union?under the terms of Act No.  and therefore does not exist as such (in this regard the Committee recalls that it has been urging the Government for many years to issue a ruling on the CTAs application for trade union status (see Case No. , Reports Nos , , , ,  and ); () in the present case a dispute might have existed but this cannot be classified as a collective dispute, and it should be noted that the justified dismissal of the workers, some of whom were reported as belonging to the pseudo-union?while others were not, was not illegal, unlike the supposed declaration of a strike?or industrial action?taken by persons who had no legal authority to do so; and () the judicial authority for labour matters has already made a decision regarding amparo proceedings instituted by the workers concerned and by the trade union association in the process of registration, in the case Bravo Juan Santos et al v. Supermercados Toledo, s.amparo? Mar del Plata Labour Tribunal No. , in which the amparo application was rejected in limine and the judges unanimously emphasized the lack of legal protection applicable to the association.
.The Committee notes this information and in particular observes the complainants allegation that once the company became aware that the administrative procedure had started for official registration of the Trade Union of Poultry Slaughtering and Processing Plant and Allied Workers, it began to harass the union leaders and members, and that following a strike it dismissed a trade union officer and a number of union members (a total of , according to the complainant); the company claims that the dismissal of workers was due to serious labour misconduct at work and not due to participation in a strike. This being the case, taking into consideration the contradictory versions of the complainant and the company and with a view to reaching a decision based on all the information, the Committee regrets that the Government has not conducted the requested investigation into all the allegations of discrimination and anti-union dismissals and urges it to do so immediately and to keep it informed in this regard. Furthermore, while noting the companys statement that the judicial authority rejected an amparo appeal filed by the representatives of the union being established, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether the dismissed workers, including trade union officer Mr Rubn scar Godoy, have taken legal action and invites the CTA to forward any additional information.
.As regards the allegation that on  April , the day of the strike, the police used force against the strikers, leaving seven injured (one of them, Mr Jos Lagos, seriously), the Committee notes the companys denial that these acts were instigated by it and/or that they occurred with the complicity of the State and declares that: () the dismissed workers plus a number of other employees and persons not employed by the company occupied the entrance to the industrial estate and violently prevented the entry or exit of people and goods to/from the company; and () the intervention of law enforcement officers, by means of an explicit order from the Public Prosecutors Office, enabled the plant to be reopened. While noting this information, the Committee regrets that the Government has not launched the requested investigation and has not sent information on the progress made as regards processing the complaints against these acts filed by the trade union with the Public Prosecutors Office of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province. The Committee therefore reiterates its recommendations and urges the Government to send the requested information.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) the Committee urges the Government to conduct the requested investigation immediately into all the allegations of discrimination and anti-union dismissals (trade union members and one union officer according to the complainant; workers according to the company) and to keep it informed in this regard. Furthermore, while noting the companys",-1,2009,Argentina
160,"statement that the judicial authority rejected an amparo appeal filed by the representatives of the union being established, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether the dismissed workers, including trade union officer MrRubn scar Godoy, have taken legal action. In addition, the Committee invites the CTA to forward any additional information.(b) As regards the allegation that on  April , the day of the strike, the police used force against the strikers, leaving seven injured (one of them, MrJos Lagos, seriously), the Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that an investigation is launched into this matter, to send information on its outcome and to send information on the outcome of the complaints against these acts filed with the Public Prosecutors Office of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) of February .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  March .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of February , the CTA alleges that Supermercados Toledo SA violates freedom of association and the rights of workers?organizations and representatives guaranteed in Conventions Nos ,  and  and Recommendation No., having committed acts of discrimination and dismissed union officers, representatives and activists. The CTA states that the case referred to in the present complaint is only one of many in which the rights of workers and organizations have been flouted. The CTA is concerned at the systematic repetition of acts infringing freedom of association; this complaint is accordingly presented against the Government of the Argentine State for failing to guarantee the exercise of trade union rights of members, officers and representatives of trade unions that are merely registered and those which have applied for registration ?in both cases, for not belonging to trade union organizations that do not have trade union status (personera gremial?.
.The complainant alleges that the company has committed acts of discrimination and engaged in anti-union conduct to the detriment of the union representative and the Congress of Argentine Workers. Supermercados Toledo SA is a supermarket enterprise engaged in retail sale of food, toiletries and cleaning items, etc. in the Mar del Plata area, which is part of Buenos Aires province. The complainant alleges the dismissal of MrRubn scar Godoy, a worker who has been with the company for many years and who, in addition to his natural leadership and continuous trade union activity, is a member of the Executive Committee of the Trade Union of Poultry Slaughtering and Processing Plant and Allied Workers. The latter unions application for trade union registration is currently being processed in the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security under file No. . The CTA states further that the poultry slaughtering plant owned by the company is located in Batn Industrial Park. Its workers slaughter and process , chickens a day, most of which are exported to the European Union, South Africa, China, Cte dIvoire and the Russian Federation, generating considerable profits for the enterprise.
.The CTA states that despite the above, not only do the workers not share in the substantial economic benefits derived from their labour by the enterprise, but they are subjected to precarious working conditions and receive a meagre income in return for their efforts. To that end, the enterprise has used a ploy that is common in Argentina: it has chosen, at its own discretion, the collective agreement that is applicable based on the amount of the wages, not on the occupation of the workers to whom it is to be applied. In this case, the enterprise decided to pay the wages determined in the collective agreement for the commercial sector, which the workers firmly contested on the grounds that a collective agreement that did not correspond to their occupation was being applied to them, with the clear aim of denying them an even greater portion of their wages.
.According to the CTA, the precarious economic situation of the workers is further exacerbated by the fact that part of their paltry earnings for such highly lucrative work is paid in the form of vouchers with which they can purchase goods only in the supermarkets belonging to the enterprise. In addition, and in violation of the principle of trade union autonomy and its obligation not to interfere, the enterprise has managed to impose a union representation other than that elected by the workers, thus violating the collective rights granted to workers in international human rights treaties with constitutional rank, including ILO Convention No. .
.The CTA points out that it was in this context of extremely poor working conditions and constant violation of rights by the company, which are condoned by omission by the public authorities responsible for supervising and enforcing compliance with labour standards, that the workforce decided to apply to the competent authority for registration of their trade union organization that was operating de facto in the enterprise. Having met the legal requirements, the trade union began the formalities of application to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security for recognition of trade union registration.
.As soon as it found out that the administrative procedure had been launched, the company began persecuting and harassing the unionized workers, singling out those it considered union leaders for especially harsh treatment. When its efforts to discourage the workers from organizing and implementing their action programmes did not succeed, the enterprise violently stepped up its illegal pressure, to the point where it selectively dismissed the leaders and activists of the new trade union.
.The CTA alleges that such is the power arbitrarily exerted by the enterprise over its dependent employees, as well as its influence over the local community, that it overtly carries out its discriminatory manoeuvres and violations of freedom of association. This explains why the company formally acknowledged its conduct in its telegrams to the dismissed workers even as they were in the process of claiming reinstatement on grounds of nullity of their dismissal as an act of anti-union discrimination prohibited by the highest ranking legal provisions: those of the National Constitution.
.The complainant indicates that the enterprise thus couched the dismissal in the following terms: ?.. in view of the fact that you not only refused to perform your duties and failed to return to work despite clear orders to that effect, but also incited your fellow workers to take the same illegal stance, causing considerable damage and failing to meet your most basic obligations, your services are no longer required? According to the CTA, the illegal anti-union actions of the enterprise are clear from the wording itself of the dismissal. The CTA alleges that, in its telegram, the company admits that the reason for the dismissal was refusal to perform duties?and inciting fellow workers to take the same illegal stance, causing considerable damage ...? According to the CTA, it is clear that the strike was being held by the dismissed worker and his fellow employees, evidently under his leadership.
.The complainant points out that the dismissal took place after the executive committee of the Trade Union of Poultry Slaughtering and Processing Plant and Allied Workers had called a strike after repeated labour demands had gone unheeded by the enterprise. The employers clear and obvious intention to penalize Mr Godoys trade union activities is further evidenced by the fact that the enterprise only dismissed him, together with the most representative workers, and not the other strikers, who, incidentally, made up the entire workforce. The complainant organization considers that it is obvious that the reason for the dismissal was not only the trade union activity itself, and especially the strike action ?already serious in itself ?but was also an attempt at an abusive display of power by the employer with the clear aim of punishing and preventing the exercise of collective rights, targeted at all the workers.
.The CTA alleges further that the company exerted pressure ?which was illegal, being anti-union and discriminatory in nature ?through dismissal and suspension of workers?representatives, including both members and non-members of the Trade Union of Poultry Slaughtering and Processing Plant and Allied Workers. On  April , the day of the strike, when the workers were mobilizing and picketing, the enterprise used all the resources and considerable influence at its command and managed to enlist the complicity of the State, which brought its repressive force to bear against the workers, so that the strike was violently repressed. As reported in the newspaper, yesterday in Mar del Plata, infantry troops repressed members of the new Trade Union of Poultry Slaughtering and Processing Plant and Allied Workers, who after demanding a wage increase from the company began to receive telegrams announcing their dismissal. The CTA alleges that police action left seven injured, one of whom, Jos Lagos, was still in hospital with a guarded prognosis. The unions lawyers filed complaints with the Public Prosecutors Office of Mar del",1,2009,Argentina
161,"Plata, Buenos Aires Province, for illegal deprivation of liberty, serious injury and dereliction of duty by a public official? When the complaint was filed, staff of the Public Prosecutors Office stated that the repressive action had not been ordered by their office. Some days earlier, the trade union had launched industrial action including partial strikes and protests against delays in paying wages and unsafe workplaces. The enterprise retaliated by dismissing  workers for disobeying orders? Faced with this situation, the workers decided to hold a strike with pickets at the entrance of the Industrial Park, which were dispersed yesterday by infantry troops.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The CTA adds that the company, in its exaggerated display of force against the trade union, went to unusual lengths in arrogating the right to declare the strike illegal, contrary to the provisions of Convention No.  and the reiterated case law of the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that it is providing a partial reply and that the Ministry of Labour of Buenos Aires Province points out that, firstly, the complaint does not specify which acts committed by the provincial Government constitute violations of freedom of association. It affirms categorically that the provincial administrative authority intervened within the limits of its own powers of conciliation and restoration of social peace. It states further that, starting with its intervention in the dispute after a complaint was filed by the workers and the CTA, it offered the parties a conciliation procedure, summoning them to a hearing and even calling in the law enforcement bodies when the employer failed to appear when summoned, and constantly sought a peaceful settlement to the dispute. An administrative procedure was thus provided as an opportunity for dialogue within the framework established by law, and the provincial Ministrys intervention was lawful and appropriate. It should be pointed out that it was the complainant that requested its intervention.
.The provincial Government adds that, once the conciliation was over, the provincial Ministry of Labour decided to cease its intervention, considering that the dispute lay outside its competence, as the complaint referred to unfair practices, questions of applicability and violations of trade union rights ?issues which should be resolved by the national Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which is the authority responsible for applying Act No.  on trade unions and/or the judiciary. Another reason for ceasing its intervention was the employers refusal to accept the administrative procedure invoking the fact that the dispute involved issues outside the provincial authoritys remit, such as those mentioned above. The provincial Ministry of Labour confined itself to holding the hearings and attempting to bring the parties to a peaceful settlement. The provincial administrative authority thus considers that there are no grounds for alleging violation of freedom of association, which is lawfully protected and guaranteed by the legislative framework in force, articles bis,  and () of the National Constitution; and Act No.  on trade unions, which expressly stipulates in section  that freedom of association shall be guaranteed by all regulations relating to the organization and activity of trade unions?and that workers have the right, inter alia, to establish trade unions freely and without prior authorization (section ).
.The complainant had an opportunity to apply for judicial review of the dismissals ordered by the employer and for enforcement of the applicable statutory penalties, and therefore the complaint presented to the ILO is rejected as unfounded and inappropriate, leading to an unnecessary waste of international jurisdictional resources. Lastly, the Government states that it will send an additional reply by the enterprise, as well as information on any judicial and administrative proceedings under way concerning the dismissals.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant states that as soon as it found out that the administrative procedure for trade union registration of the Trade Union of Poultry Slaughtering and Processing Plant and Allied Workers had been launched, Supermercados Toledo SA began persecuting and harassing union officers and members, and alleges that after the workers held a strike to uphold its many unheeded demands, the enterprise, in the context of anti-union climate and interference, dismissed union officer Mr Rubn scar Godoy and other union members (a total of ). The Committee also observes that the complainant alleges that on  April , the day of the strike, the police repressed the strikers, leaving seven workers injured (one of them, Mr Jos Lagos, seriously), and that the unions lawyers filed complaints against these acts with the Public Prosecutors Office of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province. The Committee understands that the union ultimately obtained trade union registration, but that the dismissals remain in force.
.The Committee notes that the Government sent a partial reply indicating that, according to the Ministry of Labour of Buenos Aires Province: () the provincial administrative authority intervened in the dispute in response to the CTAs complaint, within the limits of its powers of conciliation and restoration of social peace; () the provincial administrative authority offered the parties a conciliation procedure, summoning them to a conciliation hearing, and even called in the law enforcement bodies to get the employer to appear; ()once the conciliation was over, the provincial Ministry of Labour decided to cease its intervention, considering that (a) the dispute lay outside its competence, as the complaint referred to unfair practices, questions of applicability and violations of trade union rights ?issues which should be resolved by the national Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which is the authority responsible for applying Act No.  on trade unions and/or the judiciary; and (b) the employer refused to accept the administrative procedure; and () the complainant had the opportunity to apply for judicial review of the dismissals ordered by the employer and for enforcement of the applicable statutory penalties. Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government states that it will send additional information from the enterprise, as well as information on any judicial and administrative proceedings under way concerning the dismissals.
.As regards the allegation concerning dismissal of a trade union officer, Mr Rubn scar Godoy, and other members (a total of ) after holding a strike, the Committee observes that neither the national Government nor the provincial administrative authority deny that the dismissals took place, and that it appears from the statements by the provincial Ministry of Labour that the employer refused to attend a conciliation hearing. The Committee recalls that the use of extremely serious measures, such as dismissal of workers for having participated in a strike and refusal to re-employ them, implies a serious risk of abuse and constitutes a violation of freedom of association?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paragraph ]. In these circumstances, in view of the seriousness of the allegations concerning discrimination and interference by the enterprise and the failure of the attempted conciliation procedure, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation without delay into all the acts of discrimination and interference mentioned in the complaint, and to determine the reasons for the dismissals, and, should they be found to be based on anti-union motives, to take steps to bring the parties together with a view to reinstating the dismissed workers. In addition, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether those adversely affected have taken legal action.
.As regards the allegation to the effect that on  April , the day of the strike, the police repressed the strikers, leaving seven injured (one of them, Mr Jos Lagos, seriously), and that the unions lawyers filed complaints with the Public Prosecutors Office of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province, in connection with these acts, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that it has emphasized on numerous occasions that in cases in which the dispersal of public meetings by the police has involved serious injury, the Committee has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated immediately through an independent inquiry and to a regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification for the action taken by the police and to determine responsibilities. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an investigation is carried out in this respect by an authority independent from those involved, and to inform it of the outcome. The Committee also requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the complaints filed against those acts by the trade union with the Public Prosecutors Office of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation without delay into all the acts of discrimination and interference mentioned in the complaint, and to determine the reasons for the dismissal of trade union officer Mr Rubn scar Godoy and other union members (a total of ) of",-1,2009,Argentina

.The Government sent its observations in a communication in September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organization alleges that even though its affiliate organizations, the UDA and the AMET, have official trade union status at the national level, they were excluded from the negotiating commission established in the Province of Santa Fe by Decree No. / for the teaching sector (under the terms of the Decree, to be able to participate in the negotiating commission trade union organizations have to represent at least  per cent of all the workers to be represented). The Committee also notes that, following an appeal by the complainant organization, the judicial authorities issued an injunction ordering the inclusion of the UDA in each and every activity undertaken in the negotiating commission until the substantive issue is resolved. The Committee further notes the allegation by the complainant organization that, in response to the judicial appeal, the executive authorities of the Province submitted to the legislative authorities a bill on collective labour agreements for the teaching sector, which established the requirement for inclusion in the negotiating commission of membership of  per cent of all the teachers to be represented. According to the complainant organization, if the bill is approved by the Senate, the trade union AMSAFE will be the only partner in a position to be included as a joint member of the negotiating commission.
.The Committee notes that the Government refers to the response of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security of the Province of Santa Fe, which indicates that: () the system of the trade union model adopted by the national legislation is that of the promoted unit, under which official trade union status is granted to the most representative trade union organization; () this means that, of all the registered associations, only one, the most representative, exercises the official trade union representation of the activity and the other registered trade unions have functions that are not essential from the viewpoint of trade union rights; () Decree No. / establishing the negotiating commission provided that the establishment of negotiating machinery between the Ministry of Education of the Province and teachers?unions representing them at the provincial level is a necessary part of the provincial education policy with a view to determining a procedure for initiating bargaining with teachers on wages and conditions of work. The Committee notes that the Government emphasizes that the current provincial Act respecting collective agreements for the teaching personnel sector, No. , of  January , was formulated in the light of the national Act respecting collective labour agreements No., and that it provides in sections  and  for the establishment of a negotiating commission for the purposes of promoting and concluding the collective agreement, which shall be composed of  members, seven representing the provincial executive authorities and seven representing the trade union associations of teachers with a membership of at least  per cent of all those to be represented. Finally, the Committee notes that the Government emphasizes that the administrative file in the register of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security of the Province of Santa Fe, No. --, opened on February , contains a record of the participation of the UDA and the AMET in the joint meetings in the teaching sector.
.The Committee observes that, since the presentation of the complaint challenging provincial Decree No. /, Act No.  has been adopted reducing from  to per cent the required percentage for the representation of teachers to be able to participate in the negotiating commission. The Committee notes from the Governments report that, in the month of January , the AMSAFE had , members, the AMET had  members and the UDA had  members, and that the administrative authorities of the province decided that neither the AMET nor the UDA attained the minimum percentage necessary for inclusion in the negotiating commission, which does not prevent them from being in the advisory committee of that commission. The Committee recalls that on various occasions it has emphasized that systems of collective bargaining with exclusive rights for the most representative trade union and those where it is possible for a number of collective agreements to be concluded by a number of trade unions within a company are both compatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee also recalls that where the law of a country draws a distinction between the most representative trade union and other trade unions, such a system should not have the effect of preventing minority unions from functioning and at least having the right to make representations on behalf of their members and to represent them in cases of individual grievances, [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee considers that the percentage of membership required by Act No. is not in violation of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee further notes that the documentation provided by the Government attached to its reply indicates that the Government of the Province of Santa Fe convened joint discussions for the purposes of formulating the collective labour agreement for the sector on  February , that it decided that the negotiating commission would be established with five members of the AMSAFE and the SADOP representing the workers and that it also convened the advisory committee envisaged in section  of Act No. (the representatives of the AMET, in their capacity as members of the advisory committee, proposed subjects for examination to the members of the negotiating commission in a communication of  February ).
.In the light of all this information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the present case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",5,2008,Argentina

.The Government sent its observations in communications dated April and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that in this case the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) is objecting to Circular No. / of  June  issued by the Ministry of Education of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and the islands of the South Atlantic, as it considers it in violation of the exercise of trade union participation; according to the CTERA, this circular requires the directors of educational establishments to provide the General Directorate of Personnel of the Ministry of Education with the names of teachers (the information must contain the name and surname; personnel file number; date on which the teacher first attended a trade union assembly; the extent of the teachers teaching commitments; and the amount of time involved) who held assemblies between April and the date of issue of the circular. The CTERA also objects to Circular No./ of  September , issued by the Department of Institutional Communication of the state of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and the islands of the South Atlantic, which affects the directors of educational establishments, who cannot currently use communiqus to provide information, in view of the provision that, as from September , no official notices by any department or under any circumstances may be issued without prior authorization from the Department of Institutional Communication; for example, directors cannot circulate information to warn that the establishment is not in a position to open. According to the complainant organization, these circulars violate freedom of association and are damaging to the provinces education workers affiliated to SUTEF.
.With respect to Circular No. / of  June , issued by the Ministry of Education of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and the islands of the South Atlantic, the Committee notes the Governments statement that: () the legal basis of the circular is Provincial Decree No.  of  December , which approves the methodology of relations between trade union associations and the provincial state and regulates, interalia, when and where assemblies are to be held, and the communications and authorizations required in this respect; () likewise, a Supplementary Agreement Act, dated November, was signed by SUTEF and the provincial government, regulating the method of granting trade union leave for delegates and members of the trade unions staff committee; () SUTEF was fully aware of the existence of Decree No of  and, in full exercise of the powers it accords, signed the Agreement Act setting forth the modalities governing trade union leave; () the Ministry of Education was obliged to regulate the provisions in Decree No. , giving priority to the need to reconcile the rights of workers with the objectives of the state, avoiding disrupting their functions or adversely affecting the rights of the community; () educational institutions provide a service for a vulnerable sector of the population and the provision of that service should be ensured at all times ?this fact dictates the need to determine the number of teachers in attendance and the number of teachers absent attending assemblies or briefings in educational establishments throughout the province; () it is necessary to monitor whether the number of teachers who are performing their tasks is sufficient to comply with the stipulated annual schedule and will not hinder the normal performance of educational tasks; this has nothing to do with the violation of trade union rights; and ()the Ministry of Education of the province referred to a judicial decision of the National Civil Chamber, which provides that while a minor is at school, as the material custody of the child is transferred from the parents by circumstance, the vigilance and care of the child are the responsibility of the class teacher and if the child comes to any harm, the lack of vigilance must be questioned in the very place where parents send their children to be watched over and monitored.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that while the Supplementary Agreement Act of aims to establish what is meant by union leave and the working time that can be used for such leave, Circular No. / of  June , requires that information be provided on the teachers who participated in assemblies between April and June . In these circumstances, considering that the aim of the circular being objected to is unclear, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the competent authority of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and the islands of the South Atlantic revokes or amends Circular No. / of  June  in consultation with the workers?organization concerned.
.With regard to disputed Circular No. / dated  September , issued by the Department of Institutional Communication of the state of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and the islands of the South Atlantic which, according to the complainant organization, is targeted at the directors of educational establishments who can currently not use communiqus to provide information, for example to warn that the establishment is not in a position to open, establishing that, as from  September , no official notices by any department, or under any circumstances, may be issued without prior authorization from the Department of Institutional Communication, the Committee notes the Governments statement that: () the Department of Institutional Information of the Ministry of the Interior is responsible for the three public media sources in the province (Ushuaia Channel , Rio Grande Channel  and radio station Radio Fundacin Austral); () these public channels are the only available broadcast television channels in the Province and, as such, cater to a fundamental audience both in terms of being an official source of public information as well as a source of entertainment; ()given their role of public and mass media and their strategic position in view of population distribution in the province, the channels are also in considerable demand for institutional information, which means that many public institutions, plus those associated with the state, plus non-profit-making NGOs, exert pressure on the channels to broadcast a wide variety of advertising; ()in order to put an end to this situation and to manage it in a reasonable manner, Circular No. / was issued on  May , and establishes that all state administrative bodies (including autonomous entities) and social organizations interested in broadcasting free institutional advertising on state channels must adhere to a set of guidelines (it is stipulated that for the broadcast of official notices authorization will be required from the Department of Institutional Communication, but official notices of emergency information such as population alerts or school closures are exceptions to this rule); () in August , Circular No. / was issued, which specified  September  as the date of the entry into force of the order governing official advertising on the Provinces television channels, including the procedure for authorizing official notices for the city of Ro Grande, making the directors of the channels responsible for failure to comply with this procedure (this circular expressly establishes communiqus of population alerts and school closures as exceptions to this rule); () there are no cases of complaints from any school directors who have been asked to request prior authorization to broadcast a communiqu of a school closure; () at the time the circular was issued there was a conflict between SUTEF and the provincial government concerning a request for a wage increase and during that dispute the freedom of expression of the sectors was guaranteed so that the trade union officials had time to appear on the news, and () the circulars in question have been issued with the sole aim of regulating the broadcasting of free institutional advertising on the public television channels.
.Given this information and the fact that the complainant organization neither alleges that Circular No. / has been used in a discriminatory manner in respect of its members, nor highlights any obstacles in practice to the exercise of the right of expression by trade union officials, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee asks the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the competent authority of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and the islands of the South Atlantic revokes or amends Circular No. / of  June , in consultation with the workers?organization concerned.",5,2008,Argentina
165,".The present complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of State Workers (ATE) dated September .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of September , the ATE states that it is presenting a complaint against the Government of Argentina for the violation of Conventions Nos  and  through discrimination and reprisals carried out against both workers and the trade union by the management of the Dr Juan A. Fernndez General Hospital for Acute Medicine, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Health of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The ATE indicates that the present complaint concerns the following violations: (a) the management of the Dr Juan A. Fernndez General Hospital for Acute Medicine systematically violated the principle of good faith and in a discriminatory way violated the rights of the trade union by failing to provide a physical space for the development of trade union activities; and (b) there has been a tendency to harass and take reprisals against a representative of the workers of the ATE.
.The ATE has official trade union status (No. ) and is authorized to operate in the hospital in question, where it has been carrying out trade union activities for a long time. Nevertheless, it is prevented from fully carrying out its union activities in the hospital as it does not have union premises. This denial of rights has been compounded in recent months by the harassment suffered by one of the representatives of the ATE, in relation to which an order was issued to modify her working conditions.
.The ATE indicates that, first of all, it can be demonstrated among other things that the hospital management has systematically refused to make a physical space available for the performance of trade union activities, even though this is required by law. In fact, the ATE has been requesting a space and a bulletin board, as provided for in section  of Act No., since , in other words, for more than three years, and its demands have not yet met with a favourable response. The ATE has provided a copy of its latest communication to the hospital, in which it also calls upon the employer to stop its anti-union campaign against Ms Viviana Claudia Tarragona, ATEs general representative in the hospital and assistant administrative secretary of the ATEs executive board for the City of Buenos Aires. The communication states that:Buenos Aires, May . On behalf of the national executive board of the Association of State Workers (ATE), we demand that you desist immediately from this attitude of discrimination and harassment against our organization and our representatives, on pain of the appropriate legal action. The current administration has carried out a series of acts of harassment and discrimination against our general delegate and colleague Viviana Tarragona (wage deductions for days actually worked, wage deductions for days taken as union leave, etc.), constituting an attitude that is prohibited by law insofar as it concerns a member of this associations executive board for the Federal Capital and the issue of trade union immunity (cf., sections bis and , paragraph , of the National Constitution, section  et seq. of Act No.  and ILO Conventions Nos ,  and ), as well as acts of discrimination that are prohibited by law (section  of Act No. ). This attitude has been compounded by the lack of recognition shown to the organization, as you have not complied with the provisions of section  of Act No.  by neglecting to grant a physical space for the union premises of ATEs internal board in the hospital and by failing to put back the ATEs bulletin board following its removal by the management, despite being duly requested to do so. In fact, both requests have been systematically ignored, despite being an obligation on your part (section  of Act No. ), and as premises have been granted to another trade union this has become a discriminatory and anti-union issue. For these reasons, we ask that, within  hours, you desist from your anti-union and discriminatory attitude, kindly refund the amounts unduly withheld from our colleague Viviana Tarragona, and provide a physical space and a bulletin board for union activities of this organization, on pain of legal action (section, Act No. ), a complaint of unfair practice (section , Act No. ), a complaint to the ILOs Committee on Freedom of Association and criminal action for discrimination (Act No. ).
.Secondly, the ATE states that this lack of recognition is compounded by the harassment against general representative and executive board member, Ms Viviana Tarragona. For over two years, she has suffered a series of acts that, when viewed and interpreted as a whole, are evidence of the abovementioned harassment. The worker in question has suffered undue deductions for workdays on which she duly applied for union leave, has been deprived of colleagues during her nursing shift, meaning that she was overworked and prevented from carrying out her union activities, and, lastly and most seriously, has been reclassified without the corresponding proceedings to lift the trade union immunity provided under Argentinean law. Ms Viviana Tarragona was elected as the general representative in the hospital on September , and the hospital was notified on September . Similarly, on May, she was elected assistant administrative secretary of the executive board for the autonomous City of Buenos Aires, taking office on  November , and the hospital was notified on  September .
.Irregardless of her immunity, by Order No. /DGARH/ and without the corresponding proceedings to lift her immunity, Ms Tarragona was demoted to a lower grade, causing her serious financial damage. Upon learning of this violation, the ATE sent a letter to the government of the City of Buenos Aires on  August , calling for the annulment of Order No. /DGARH/ on the grounds that it was illegal and inappropriate.
.The attitudes adopted by the government of the City of Buenos Aires and the Dr Juan A. Fernndez Hospital for Acute Medicine may be considered from different perspectives, but overall they constitute anti-union activity because the employer is the same in all cases. With regard to the reprisals against a union representative, there is a clear impairment of the rights of a workers?representative to perform her union duties in the hospital. In fact, the general representative of the ATEs internal board, Ms Viviana Claudia Tarragona, suffered as a result of her union activities ?her salary was cut on several occasions because of false accusations and her grade was changed even though she had trade union immunity. It is worth mentioning that undue deductions were taken from the pay of the representative in question for days worked and days taken off as union leave. Both the ATE and Ms Tarragona have sent telegrams and requests in response to these violations, but they have received no reply to date and the harassment has not stopped. This situation was further compounded by the fact that, by Order No. /DGARH/, MsTarragonas working conditions were modified, even though she had trade union immunity in accordance with the provisions of Act No. .
.With respect to discrimination and the failure to make union premises available, the management of the hospital has systematically refused to provide a physical space for the ATE. Since , the ATE has called for the provision of union premises and for compliance with Act No. , and to date it has neither been granted the premises nor given a response. Consequently, there is only one set of trade union premises in the hospital in question, which was granted to another union, even though such a physical space, as is provided for by law, has been denied to this organization. This attitude runs counter to freedom of association as provided for in Act No. , section  of which states that: Without prejudice to the provisions of collective labour agreements, employers shall: (a) provide a place where staff representatives may carry out their activities, to the extent made necessary by the nature of the establishment, taking into account the number of workers involved and the mode of service delivery ...? It is the understanding of the ATE that the refusal of the administration to provide it with a physical space shows a clear attitude of discrimination which is contrary to the spirit of the domestic and international legislation mentioned above.
.In its communication of April , the Government states that, having gathered the relevant information, the management of the Dr Juan A. Fernndez General Hospital for Acute Medicine indicates that, before a reply is given to specific allegations, it should be emphasized that several trade union associations (SUTECBA, the UPCN, the ATE, the Association of Municipal Physicians, the Association of",0,2008,Argentina
166,"Professionals, etc.) operate in the institution, along with ordinary associations of psychologists, biochemists, nurses, pharmacists, etc. This broad and non-exhaustive list of social partners within the scope of the Ministry of Health led to the signature in  of Decision No.  in the Joint Sectoral Committee for the Ministry of Health. The Government also draws attention to the full implementation of Article of Convention No. , with respect to trade union plurality, as set out in the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee.
.The hospital indicates that, in the abovementioned Decision No. , it is agreed that: ?representation must meet objective requirements with regard to membership ? ?that representation to that effect may be exercised when proof is provided that it has as a minimum the support of at least  per cent of hospital employees ...?(section  of Act No.  on trade union associations). The hospital management notes in this regard that the ATE must prove that it has the support of that  per cent, which it has never done. Nevertheless, the authority in question has never questioned the nature of minority representation in the institution and has always endeavoured to work with the union.
.As for the alleged discrimination against and failure to recognize the ATE by not providing it with union premises, as is required by law, it is emphasized that, given the particular characteristics of the institution (it is a public hospital where priority is given to patient care and ongoing staff training), and given that it is located in a building that cannot be extended, it does not currently have any free spaces that could be used for the requested purposes. Nevertheless, studies are currently being carried out into possible architectural modifications that would make it possible to provide a physical space for the development of trade union activities. With regard to the alleged rejection of a request for permission to put up a bulletin board, the institution categorically denies this allegation, as on various occasions it has authorized the placement of a bulletin board on the fifth floor in the main staff entrance hall, which is a area that the entire hospital staff has to pass through, on the condition that the cost of the bulletin board should be covered by the ATE. To date, no bulletin board has been put up in the space agreed upon with the representatives of that association, a situation that is certainly not attributable to the hospital, which in its reply stresses that the space in question is available. The institution states that, when agreement was reached with regard to the space in question, the union agreed that it would stop posting fliers on walls throughout the building.
.As for the alleged reprisals against the union official, Ms Tarragona, the Government indicates that she is a nurse and works on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays in the out-of-hours medical unit. This unit provides a public service and deals with a high number of patients, especially on weekends, as the institution has an emergency medicine and trauma centre and so receives many accident victims; it should also be noted that the hospital is located near to several high-speed roads. Furthermore, the Government indicates that the hospital is located close to several recreation and dance establishments, which means that a significant number of patients receive medical attention for alcohol-related conditions and for injuries caused in accidents, especially during weekends. There are also the normal patient demands, for the treatment of various conditions. In the report, the director of the institution indicates that it is common knowledge that there is a lack of trained nursing staff, in both the public and the private sectors. However, efforts have continued to be made to make more nurses available in all of the hospitals departments, including the outof-hours medical unit. Accordingly, in recent months there has been a significant increase in the nursing staff, especially in the out-of-hours medical unit, which has had a new intake of six nurses. In the light of the above, the Government rejects the allegation that nurses were withdrawn from the out-of-hours medical unit intentionally to do a disservice to MsTarragona.
.With regard to Order No. /DGARH/, under which, according to the ATE, MsTarragona was demoted to a lower grade, it is reported that on  February  there was a meeting of the Administrative Technical Advisory Committee (CATA), a body comprising the department heads of the hospitals administrative and professional technical services, union representatives of the Association of Municipal Physicians, SUTECBA and representatives of the hospital management and deputy management. At the meeting, the SUTECBA representative reported that some members of the nursing staff were classified as registered nurses but did not have the necessary qualifications, and requested the hospital management to investigate the alleged irregularity.
.An assessment was made by human resources, which found that four staff members were on a pay scale that was applicable to registered nurses, while they were qualified as licensed practical nurses. These nurses included Ms Tarragona and three other people (who were named). This information was sent to the Ministry of Finance, which issued the order that is now being challenged (No. /DGARH/) to adjust the grades of the staff members accordingly. This is a matter that falls within the Ministry of Finances area of competence, given that it concerns the classification of staff in accordance with the effective verification of the qualifications of Ms Viviana Tarragona, Ms Ester Pelozo, MsRosa Prez and Ms Mara Cristina Vzquez. In other words, far from being harassment, their grades were adjusted to reflect their actual qualifications. No other aspects of the reviewed situation or work situation of Ms Tarragona or her reclassified colleagues were changed in any way.
.With regard to the days deducted for having applied for union leave, the institution indicates that the deductions were made in April and May  and were repaid in accordance with Note No.  HGAJAF of  June . The deductions from September  were also repaid, following the proper and timely submission of the relevant documentation. It is stressed in conclusion that it is the spirit and policy of the hospital management (the current director has been working for the institution for years) to work in partnership with the different trade unions and associations, never losing sight of the fact that better working conditions for all will lead directly to the better delivery of health services to patients and setting out the shortcomings and difficulties faced by the institution, which are discussed with the union representatives of the bodies concerned.
.The Government adds that the Director General for Administration in the Human Resources Management Unit of the Ministry of Finance of the government of the City of Buenos Aires sent a note that supports the observations made by the hospital management, to the effect that Ms Tarragonas reclassification was the result of an assessment of staff duties under the new system governing the administrative careers of city government officials, which has nothing whatsoever to do with her union activities; furthermore, the union official did not duly raise an objection to the measure challenged in this complaint in accordance with the procedural remedies at her disposal (Administrative Procedure Act).
.The Committee notes that, in this case, the complainant organization, the ATE, alleges that the authorities of the Dr Juan A. Fernndez Hospital for Acute Medicine has, in a discriminatory way, failed to provide it with union premises for carrying out its trade union activities, has not given it a place for a bulletin board and that acts of anti-union harassment have been taken against one of its officials.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the refusal to provide the ATE with premises for carrying out its trade union activities (according to the ATE, it has been demanding such premises since  and the hospital has made premises available to another trade union), the Committee notes that, according to the hospital in question: () several trade union associations (SUTECBA, the UPCN, the ATE, the Association of Municipal Physicians, the Association of Professionals, etc.) operate in the institution, as do ordinary associations of psychologists, biochemists, nurses, pharmacists, etc., and that the number of social partners led to the signature in  of Decision No.  in the Joint Sectoral Committee within the Ministry of Health; () in Decision No. , it was agreed that representation must meet objective requirements with regard to membership and that representation to that effect may be exercised when proof is provided that it has as a minimum the support of at least  per cent of hospital employees; () the ATE never provided proof of such support, but nevertheless the authority in question has never questioned the nature of minority representation in the institution and has always endeavoured to work with the trade union; () given the particular characteristics of the institution (it is a public hospital where priority is given to patient care and ongoing staff training) and, given that it is located in",4,2008,Argentina
167,"a building that cannot be extended, it does not currently have any free spaces that could be used for the purposes requested by the ATE; () nevertheless, studies are currently being carried out into possible architectural modifications that would make it possible to provide a physical space for the development of trade union activities.
.In this respect, while noting the difficulties in the hospital with regard to making union premises available to trade unions, the Committee notes with interest that studies are being carried out to find a solution to this issue. The Committee recalls that Convention No.  provides in its Article  that: (a) facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognized public employees?organizations as may be appropriate in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work; (b) the granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned; and (c) the nature and scope of these facilities shall be determined in accordance with the methods referred to in Article  of this Convention, or by other appropriate means. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that, taking into account the provisions of the abovementioned Convention, the ATE and the hospital authorities will be able to reach a satisfactory agreement in this respect.
.With regard to the refusal by the hospital authorities to provide a space for an ATE bulletin board, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () on various occasions, it gave the ATE permission to put up a bulletin board on the fifth floor in the main staff entrance hall, which is an area that the entire hospital staff has to pass through, on the condition that the cost of the bulletin board would be covered by the ATE; () to date, no bulletin board has been put up in the space agreed upon with the representatives of that trade union, a situation that is not attributable to the hospital, which has stressed that the space is available; and () when a space was provided for the bulletin board, the union agreed that it would not post fliers on walls throughout the building. In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.With regard to the allegation that acts of anti-union harassment have been taken against one of its officials, Ms Viviana Claudia Tarragona (according to the complainant, these include undue deductions of workdays ?including those on which she applied for union leave ?work overload during her shift as a result of a decision to withdraw staff and modification of her professional grade ?and therefore her employment conditions ?causing her material damage), the Committee notes that, according to the Government: ()the trade union official in question is a nurse and works on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays in the out-of-hours medical unit, which provides a public service and deals with a high number of patients, especially during weekends, as the institution has an emergency medicine and trauma centre and receives many accident victims; () according to the director of the institution, it is common knowledge that there is a lack of trained nursing staff, in both the public and the private sectors, but there have nevertheless been ongoing efforts to make more nurses available in all of the hospitals departments, including the out-of-hours medical unit. Accordingly, in recent months there has been a significant increase in the nursing staff, especially in the out-of-hours medical unit, which has had a new addition of six nurses and, in the light of this, the allegation that nurses were withdrawn from the out-of-hours medical unit intentionally to do a disservice to MsTarragona cannot be sustained; () with regard to Order No. /DGARH/, under which, according to the ATE, Ms Tarragona was demoted to a lower grade; on February  there was a meeting of the CATA, a body comprising the department heads of the hospitals administrative and professional technical services, union representatives of the Association of Municipal Physicians and SUTECBA, and representatives of hospital management and, at the meeting, the SUTECBA representative reported that some members of the nursing staff were classified as being registered nurses but did not have the necessary qualifications and requested the hospital management to investigate the alleged irregularity; () an assessment was made of staff duties under the new system governing the administrative careers of city government officials, which found that four staff members were on a pay scale that was applicable to registered nurses, when they were qualified as licensed practical nurses; () Ms Tarragona and three other nurses were found to be in this situation. This information was sent to the Ministry of Finance, which issued the order that is now being challenged (No./DGARH/) to adjust the grades of the staff members accordingly (this is a matter that falls within its area of competence, given that it concerns the classification of staff in accordance with the effective verification of their qualifications); () far from being a form of harassment, the grades were adjusted to reflect their actual qualifications. No other aspects of the reviewed situation or work situation of Ms Tarragona or her reclassified colleagues were changed in any way; () with regard to the days deducted for having applied for union leave, the deductions were made in April and May  but were repaid in accordance with Note No.  HGAJAF of  June , and the deductions of September  were also repaid, following the proper and timely submission of the relevant documentation; and ()it is the spirit and policy of the hospital management to work in partnership with the different trade unions and associations, not losing sight of the fact that better working conditions for all will lead directly to the better delivery of health services to patients and setting out the shortcomings and difficulties faced by the institution, which are discussed with the union representatives of the bodies concerned. In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee expresses the hope that, taking into account the provisions of Convention No. , the ATE and the authorities of the Dr Juan A.

Moreover, should Mr Micheli request it, the Committee requests the Government to provide him with the protection deemed necessary to guarantee his personal safety.

.Lastly, the Government requests that the complainant trade union be asked for more specific information than that previously supplied, and reiterates the Governments desire to achieve satisfactory clarification of the facts and conduct the corresponding investigation.
.The Committee recalls that, in the present case, the complainant organizations alleged that Mr Pablo Micheli, a trade union leader of the CTA and the ATE, was temporarily abducted (for an hour and a half) on  June  with the aim of causing intimidation because of his trade union activity, and that the Committee, at its November  meeting, requested the complainant organizations to provide precise information about the complaint lodged with the Prosecutors Office, and further details, to enable the Prosecutors Office to communicate information about any progress made in any investigation into the abduction. It also requested the Government to carry out an investigation concerning the allegations and expected that those responsible for planning and perpetrating the abduction would be severely punished.
.The Committee notes that the Government indicates that it asked the Ministry of Labour of Buenos Aires Province to carry out an investigation concerning the complaint referred to by the complainant organizations and that the provincial Government reported that: () an electronic search did not locate the complaint in Investigative Unit (UFI) No.  or in UFI No. ; () there is no Criminal Court No.  in the Judicial District of Lomas de Zamora; and () the complaint was not found in the general registry of the district or in the records of Federal Courts Nos  and . The Committee also notes that the Government again requests that the complainant organizations be asked for more specific information than that previously supplied, and that it reiterates its desire to achieve satisfactory clarification of the facts.
.The Committee notes this information and urges the Government to do everything within its power to ensure that the complaint lodged with the Prosecutors Office is retrieved and that the competent investigating authorities initiate an immediate investigation concerning the alleged temporary abduction with the aim of causing intimidation, on  June , of Mr Pablo Micheli, trade union leader of the CTA and the ATE, because of his trade union activity. It requests the complainant organizations to provide the authorities with as much information as possible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to do everything within its power to ensure that the complaint lodged with the Prosecutors Office is retrieved and that the competent investigating authorities initiate an immediate investigation concerning the alleged temporary abduction with the aim of causing intimidation, on  June , of Mr Pablo Micheli, trade union leader of the CTA and the ATE, because of his trade union activity.

The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Association of State Workers (ATE) of July . The CTA sent additional information in communications dated May  and February .
.In communications dated  September and  October , and  July , the Government requested additional information from the complainant organizations to enable it to send its reply. The said information was sent to the Government on  March . As the Government has not replied, the Committee has had to postpone the examination of the case on two occasions. At its meeting in MayJune  [see thReport, para. ], the Committee issued an urgent appeal to the Government, stating that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its thReport (), approved by the Governing Body, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting even if the information or observations requested had not been received in due time. The Government has sent its observations in a communication dated August .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant organizations allege the temporary abduction (for an hour and a half) with the aim of causing intimidation because of his trade union activity of the CTAs Deputy Secretary-General and the ATEs Secretary-General, Mr Pablo Micheli, on  June . The complainant organizations point out that the abduction took place at the entrance of Mr Michelis home by an armed group, whose members said that they knew the names of his spouse and children, and that during the abduction they threatened him in order to stop him from talking or taking action.
.The Committee notes that, since the complaint was referred to the Government, the latter requested the case number of the criminal complaint to enable it to submit the relevant information. The complainant organization sent the information concerning the number of the case in February . Nevertheless, in its recent communication, the Government indicates that there is no individual file containing the information provided by the trade union.
.Under these circumstances, taking into account the seriousness of the allegations, the Committee urges the complainant organization to provide precise information and further details about the complaint lodged with the Prosecutors Office, in order to enable the Government to communicate information about any progress in the investigation that is said to be under way regarding the abduction of the trade union leader, Mr Pablo Micheli. Moreover, the Committee further requests the Government to carry out an investigation concerning the allegations and expects that those responsible for planning and perpetrating the abduction will be severely punished. Moreover, should Mr Micheli request it, the Committee requests the Government to provide him with the protection deemed necessary to guarantee his personal safety.

170,".The present complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of State Workers (ATE) of July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of July , the ATE states that it is making its present complaint against the Government on account of the excessive restriction placed on, and prohibition of, the strike by the Ministry of Health of the Province of Mendoza and by the Fourth Family Court of that province. The complainant points out that: the Argentine State ratified Convention No.  in ; the Constitution in its article bis guarantees the right to strike as a fundamental right of trade unions; the second paragraph of article , subsection, accords constitutional status to a series of international human rights treaties, including the  United Nations Covenants, thereby granting the same status to Convention No. ; and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights further specifies that States parties undertake to ensure the right to strike. Despite this, according to the complainant, measures were taken in systematic violation of freedom of association.
.The ATE states that the complaint concerns the following violations: (a) within the context of the strikes being carried out in the provinces hospitals and health centres, the Ministry of Health of the Province of Mendoza, by resolution No. / of  June , unilaterally and without being competent to do so, ordered the establishment of minimum services in violation of the maximum established under the corresponding legislation in force and relevant ILO principles, setting the level of service provision at  per cent, thereby effectively prohibiting the right to strike; and (b) the Fourth Family Court of the First Judicial District of the Province of Mendoza issued an injunction ordering the ATE to comply with the minimum duty levels stipulated in the aforementioned resolution No./, under penalty of application of article  of the Penal Code. The ATE considers this to be a veritable assault on freedom of association by the government of the Province of Mendoza and hence a violation of Convention No. , inasmuch as the exercise of the right to strike is being restricted and prohibited.
.The complainant states that, within the framework of the ongoing collective bargaining process between the union entities representing state employees of the Province of Mendoza and the provinces government authorities, the ATE, being unable to agree to the proposed pay increase and in response to a series of violations of the principle of bargaining in good faith, decided on various forms of direct action within the provincial hospitals?sector and other health centres. On  June , the Subsecretariat of Labour of the Province of Mendoza convened the parties in dispute in an attempt, in its own words, to maintain social calm; however, no agreement was reached on account of the absence of any proposals on the government side.
.In view of the ongoing collective dispute, and the lack of proposals or convocations on the part of the provincial government, on  June , the General Secretary of the ATE provincial council in Mendoza sent a registered letter to the Governor of the Province of Mendoza, stating that:As the trade union with the highest level of representativity in the province in the field of health, having the highest number of paid-up affiliated workers, and given that you and your subordinate officials have refused to engage in collective bargaining with the Association of State Workers (ATE), the union organization empowered under Act  to engage in collective bargaining, thereby causing delays which hamper the negotiation process aimed at resolving the current conflict in the health sector ... I hereby call upon you to take, within five days, the necessary measures to rectify such conduct and convene a meeting with the most representative organization for the purpose of resolving the conflict in accordance with the corresponding legislation, under penalty of initiation of the proceeding for unfair practices (article, Act No. ), a complaint to the International Labour Organization (ILO) and appropriate legal proceedings.In the absence of any response or specific action by the provincial government to resolve the conflict, forceful measure were maintained and stepped up until, on  June , the Ministry of Health of the Province of Mendoza issued resolution No. / setting the minimum levels of service.
.The ATE states that Ministry of Health resolution No. / sets the minimum levels of service, this in itself being illegal, emanating as it does from the employer itself. Yet more serious, however, is the fact that it sets a coverage level of  per cent for the majority of services, and  per cent for administrative services. The ATE reports that this administrative resolution was appealed against on the day following its announcement, on account of the violations of freedom of association described below. Despite this, the government of the Province of Mendoza applied to the local family court for an injunction (medida cautelar) and a ruling ordering those concerned to comply with resolution No./. In its presentation of the case, the government does not indicate that there is any current or imminent risk, but invokes childrens right to health.
.According to the ATE, the judge analysed the situation in terms of right? without considering the facts of the case. In other words, her understanding is that the need to give effect to childrens right to health requires a  per cent level of service, leading her to order compliance with resolution No. /, thus effectively prohibiting the right to strike. The ATE draws attention to what it considers the absurdity of a situation in which it is not the labour court that is ruling on a labour dispute but the family court. It asserts that at no time in any union dispute throughout its  years of existence has it put anyones health or health care at risk. Furthermore, it is health workers, not governments, who ensure, every day of the year and not only at times of dispute, the provision of adequate health care. The present case is no different, as there has been no complaint of lack of care. In the absence of any agreement as to minimum service levels, it is the ATE that is guaranteeing compliance with the ILO provisions and relevant legislation in force, not the employer.
.The ATE wishes to emphasize that by issuing resolution No. /, the Ministry of Health of the Province of Mendoza, together with the local court that ordered compliance with the resolution, is engaged in conduct which violates the principles of international labour law, and more specifically the principles of freedom of association enshrined in Conventions Nos  and . In concrete terms, the resolution contains the following irregularities: (a)the employer cannot set the minimum service levels; (b) abusive curtailment of the right to strike by setting the minimum service level at  per cent; and (c) prohibition of the right to strike.
.According to the ATE, it has first to be pointed out that the Ministry of Health of the Province of Mendoza is the direct employer, since the issue concerns a dispute and a strike in the hospitals for which it is responsible. The State is thus acting as both judge and party in this collective dispute within the public sector, although this is prohibited under the local legislation in force and has been repeatedly criticized by the Committee. The ATE points out in this regard that, under the relevant local legislation, it is section  of Act No.  which governs collective disputes in essential services. That provision establishes a reference to the guidelines and international case law developed by the Committee on Freedom of Association, incorporating the labour principles pertaining to essential services. This being the case, and in accordance with that supervisory bodys case law, the unilateral setting of minimum service levels by the provincial Ministry of Health, through resolution No. /, is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.The ATE reiterates that the local administrative labour authority, the Subsecretariat of Labour of the Province of Mendoza, did not convene nor at any time seek to bring about a negotiated settlement between the parties, as is required under the law. Although it is not competent to do so itself, since, under the terms of article  of Act No. , such competence lies with the national Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, the local authority nevertheless failed to request the intervention of the national Ministry. Under the terms of article  of Act No. , the responsibility for guaranteeing the provision of minimum services lies with the party?that has decided to take action.
.The ATE points out that, in accordance with the case law of the Committee on Freedom of Association, there are certain services in which prohibiting the right to strike may be deemed acceptable, without this amounting to a violation",0,2008,Argentina
171,"of freedom of association. Where such activities are concerned, it is essential that expeditious negotiation and dispute resolution mechanisms be in place as a counterbalance for workers who are deprived of such a fundamental right. However, this is not the case in Argentina, whose legislation does not provide for the prohibition of strikes in any activity ?an approach which, given the progressive nature of its social human rights environment, could no longer be implemented in this country. The necessary consequence of this is that prohibition of the right to strike does not ?and cannot ?exist in Argentina, even though the ILO has provided for such a possibility in other contexts which do not apply here.
.The judicial ruling ordering compliance with the Ministry of Healths resolution No./, on the grounds that article  of Act No.  authorizes prohibition of the right to strike, is therefore incorrect. Setting a minimum service level of  per cent is no more than an expression of the administrations desire to prohibit strike action. A contrast cannot be made, as the judicial ruling does, between the right of children to health care and the right to strike, first of all because no ones life is being put at risk, which is why the abovementioned injunction was not issued on those grounds; second, because it is for this very reason that there is a minimum service, which is not the normal level of service; and third, because the Family Court is mistaken in its identification of the legal guarantor of the right to which it refers, since guaranteeing the protection of children is the responsibility not of the workers but of the State, and it is in any case the State that is failing to provide the necessary resources to protect childrens rights in the present health case, concerning specifically health workers?wages. The Family Court is thus placing an obligation on a party which is not a legal guarantor.
.The ruling itself fails to go into the substance of the dispute, confining itself to ordering compliance with resolution No. /. In other words, while on the one hand the Ministry of Health is setting the minimum level of service at  per cent of normal services, the family court ?which has no competence in this area ?is for its part ordering compliance with the resolution on penalty of application of the Penal Code, which provides for imprisonment. This entails another extremely serious violation of freedom of association, since the penalty established by the judge is imprisonment, this being tantamount to categorizing the exercise of the right to strike as a crime punishable by a period of between  days to one year in prison. Furthermore, one of the arguments put forward was that no appeal had been lodged against resolution No. /, whereas in reality an appeal was lodged in good time, and that the ruling was not definitive or agreed upon. According to the ATE, all this is just a manoeuvre aimed at prohibiting the right to strike, which is not counterbalanced by any exceptional assurance of negotiation.
.In its communication of May , the Government states that in the first place, it has to be understood that in the present case there were no excessive restrictions on the right to strike, and still less any legal prohibition. The Government points out that within the framework of the collective bargaining on wages for , the ATE union had arranged for various forms of action, the provincial government for its part having guaranteed that the right to strike could be exercised in full. According to the Government, the union, contrary to what it states in its complaint, guaranteed only minimum service levels, equivalent to a Sunday level of service, thereby for the most part completely paralysing the work of the provinces health-care providers.
.The Government states that in accordance with the principles governing strike action in essential services, and given that the guiding principle therein is negotiated settlement of the dispute by the parties concerned, or else agreement and establishment by the parties of minimum services, a conciliation hearing was organized at the headquarters of the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security. During the hearing, it was impressed upon the parties that, in the event of the announcement of direct action by the ATE, ATSA and AMPROS, the participating trade unions should agree with the provincial Ministry of Health on the minimum services to be guaranteed during the strike. In a procedure similar to the one established by Decree No. /, the parties were urged to reach agreement on the minimum services to be provided during the period of the action. The ATE, totally disregarding the body of doctrine which guides and informs Decree No. /, insisted on pursuing a position against the public rights and interest, maintaining only a minimum service equivalent to a Sunday service.
.The Government points out that this position is without any legal foundation, implies the abusive exercise of the right to strike, and ignores the likely consequences of paralysing the health services. The Government maintains that the failure to agree on minimum services did not stem from any negligence on the part of the provincial government, but rather from the obstinate position on the part of the union in not wishing to reach such agreement. In response to this situation, the Ministry of Health issued resolution No./ whereby the provinces health authority establishes the percentages of service to be maintained in each health service during the period of the direct action. It is clear from the foregoing that at no time was direct action prohibited, but that a number of services were earmarked as critical and hence as requiring guaranteed  per cent coverage. The Ministry of Health issued the resolution in question solely in respect of the critical services and only after having made every possible attempt to reach agreement with the union on the provision of an adequate minimum service.
.As regards the ruling by the Fourth Family and Juvenile Court, the Government states that, here again, this does not imply prohibition of the right to strike, since the action was left totally unrestricted in so far as most people were concerned, compliance with resolution No./ having been required solely in regard to minors up to age , in accordance with article  of Act No. , which provides that: ?where there is a conflict between the rights and interests of children and adolescents with respect to other, equally legitimate, rights or interests, the former shall prevail? In other words, the ruling ordered that protection be assured for the rights of children and young persons below the age of ,in the light of the failure to reach an agreement on minimum services between the union and the health authority at the meeting held for that purpose.
.The Committee notes that in this case, the complainant organization alleges that, in the context of the strikes being carried out in the provinces hospitals and health centres, the Ministry of Health of the Province of Mendoza, by resolution No. /, and in violation of the principles of freedom of association, unilaterally ordered that minimum services be provided at the level of  per cent, and that the judicial authority (with competence in the area of family law, rather than labour law, to which the complainant objects) issued an injunction ordering compliance with the minimum duty levels stipulated in the aforementioned resolution (on penalty of penal sanction).
.In this respect, the Committee notes the Governments information that: () within the framework of the collective bargaining held to discuss wages, the ATE arranged for various forms of direct action and the provincial government guaranteed that the right to strike could be exercised in full; () the complainant organization guaranteed minimum services equivalent only to a Sunday service; () in accordance with the principles governing strike action in essential services, a conciliation hearing was organized at the headquarters of the Subsecretariat of Labour and Social Security, it being impressed upon the parties that they should agree on the minimum services to be guaranteed during the strike; () the ATE insisted on maintaining only minimum level of service equivalent to a Sunday service; () that position is without any legal foundation, entails the abusive exercise of the right to strike and ignores the likely consequences of paralysing the health services; () the failure to agree on the minimum services did not stem from any negligence on the part of the provincial government, but rather from the obstinate position of the union in not wishing to reach such agreement, in response to which attitude the Ministry of Health issued the resolution in question establishing the percentages of workers required to be on duty in each health service during the period of the strike; () at no time was direct action prohibited, but a number of services were earmarked as critical and hence as requiring guaranteed  per cent coverage; () resolution No. / was issued after every possible effort had been made to",-1,2008,Argentina
172,"reach agreement with the union on the provision of an adequate minimum service.
.The Committee recalls, first, that the health/hospital sector is an essential service in which the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee observes in this respect that Argentinas national legislation permits the exercise of the right to strike in this sector, while stipulating the need to maintain minimum services.
.In this context, the Committee observes that in the present case, according to the documentation communicated by the complainant organization, a meeting was held between the parties, presided over by the administrative labour authority of the Province, for the purposes of determining the percentage of services to be maintained during the holding of the direct action? but that the parties failed to reach agreement. The Committee further observes that in response to the absence of agreement, the provinces Ministry of Health issued resolution No. / providing that in certain health sectors (intensive care units, emergency services, cardiovascular recovery, neonatal therapy, etc.) a  per cent level of service should be guaranteed, while in other services (laboratory, imaging, haemotherapy, etc.) a  per cent level should be maintained. In this respect, the Committee recalls that employees deprived of the right to strike because they perform essential services must have appropriate guarantees to safeguard their interests, for example, provision of joint conciliation procedures, and, where conciliation fails, the provision of joint arbitration machinery [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In the case of workers not engaged in essential services in the strict sense of the term, but who carry out tasks in which a minimum service may be imposed, the Committee emphasizes that on numerous occasions it has indicated that where there is any disagreement as to the number and duties of the workers concerned in the minimum services to be maintained, provision should be made for such disagreement to be settled by an independent body and not by the Ministry of Labour or the ministry or public enterprise concerned [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee trusts that the Government will ensure respect for these principles.
.As regards the allegation that it was a family court, rather than a labour court, which required that the full range of health services be guaranteed in the case of children and adolescents aged from  to  years, on penalty of penal sanctions, the Committee considers that the specific remits of courts should be determined by national legislation and that the Committees role is confined to ensuring that any decisions taken are in line with the principles of freedom of association. As regards the alleged possibility of penal sanctions against strikers who fail to abide by the judicial ruling, the Committee emphasizes that any penalty in respect of illegitimate actions linked to strikes should be proportionate to the offence or fault committed, and that the authorities should not have recourse to measures of imprisonment for the mere fact of organizing or participating in a peaceful strike [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee trusts that the Government will guarantee that employees deprived of the right to strike because they perform essential services have appropriate guarantees to safeguard their interests, for example, provision of joint conciliation procedures, and, where conciliation fails, the provision of joint arbitration machinery; and that where there is any disagreement as to the minimum number of workers and minimum services to be maintained in the case of a strike in non-essential services, but in which a minimum service may be imposed, such disagreement is settled by a body independent of the parties involved.",-1,2008,Argentina
173,".The Committee last examined this case regarding the alleged anti-union dismissals and changes to the conditions of employment by the National University of La Rioja in its November  meeting, when it requested the Government to keep it informed of the result of all ongoing judicial proceedings related to the allegations submitted by the complainants against the university [see th report, paras ?].
.In its communication of  February , the Government submits a large number of documents sent by the University of La Rioja. The University of La Rioja submits copies of first and second instance rulings in connection with the judicial proceedings (constitutional protection proceedings and precautionary measures) initiated by the lecturers concerned by this case. These documents indicate that some of the rulings uphold the complainants?requests (particularly regarding the payment of wage arrears) while others reject them (particularly regarding appointments to teaching posts or changes to the hours of work).
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.This present complaint is contained in a communication from the National Federation of University Teachers, Researchers and Creators (Historic Federation of Teachers) and from the Riojan Association of University Teaching Staff (ARDU) dated May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations allege various acts of anti-union discrimination by the National University of La Rioja (UNLaR) since  when it initiated academic proceedings against the lecturer, Estela Cruz de Garca, Secretary-General of ARDU (an allegation that was examined by the Committee in Case No. ). The complainant organizations specifically allege the following anti-union acts: () the anti-union dismissals in April  of the Secretary-General of ARDU, Estela Cruz de Garca, the Deputy Secretary, Mara Alonso, and the Finance Secretary, Eduardo Berra (according to the complainants an appeal for the protection of constitutional rights and precautionary measures have been brought and the reinstatement of the dismissed workers has been ordered); () in August  three lecturers were dismissed from University College, all trade union delegates of ARDU (according to the complainants judicial proceedings are under way in respect of these dismissals); () in August , the finance secretary, J.C. Ruiz, was dismissed (according to the complainants in the context of the judicial proceedings the university was severely questioned and was ordered to pay the lost income for the  period for the financial damages suffered; () in December , seven members of the executive committee and union auditors were dismissed, including the Secretary-General of ARDU and a member of the executive committee of the Historic Federation of Teachers; () in January , the trade union secretary of ARDU and one auditor were dismissed (according to the complainants an appeal for the protection of constitutional rights has been lodged); () in February , following a protest by lecturers, parents and students, the UNLaR made a criminal accusation against the members of ARDU for violation of the constitutional democratic system, which was dismissed by the judicial authority; and () in July , the working conditions of three members of the executive committee of ARDU were changed (reduction in the number of hours of paid work), and the same happened in August  to another four members of the committee (according to the complainants judicial proceedings were initiated in respect of these issues and the decisions in favour of the workers were appealed against by the UNLaR). The Committee observes, lastly, that the complainant organizations allege that the dismissals were carried out without respecting the rules for the protection of trade union activities and that the labour courts have found in some cases that the trade union official must be granted protection even if he was elected whilst in a specific job that was completed.
.The Committee notes that the Government indicates that: () the acts in question relate to a national university of a provincial state that is autonomous and sovereign in its government and in the documents it issues; () by virtue of the principles of autonomy and sovereignty the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security sent a copy of the complaint to the University to enable it to defend itself as appropriate; () the acts questioned by the complainant organizations have been appealed against before the judicial authorities ?in some cases the courts have issued rulings and others are still under examination; () in the present case, where the trade union organization lacks official trade union status (which is granted to the most representative organization), legal protection against anti-union acts is established in article  of Act No. ; () in one of the cases brought by a number of trade union officials the Federal Appeal Court of Crdoba ?in second instance proceedings ?found in favour of the validity of the legal protection of the lecturers with trade union responsibilities and, for example, considered that in the case of personnel granted trade union stability any change to conditions of work should initially be dealt with using article  of Act No., that is to say a judicial ruling for the exclusion of trade union protection should be obtained, which did not happen in the case in hand, rendering unlawful the actions of the defendant?and that this being the case, and for the reasons given, as the defendant did not respect the trade union protection of the plaintiffs by modifying their conditions of work without respecting the legal procedures, the appeal lodged by the University should be dismissed and, consequently, the appealed decision should be upheld, which stipulates the payment to the plaintiffs of the difference in salary outstanding in respect of their assigned hours of work up until  August ? ()the decision is clear in ordering the employer to respect the conditions of work of the lecturers in question; and () the matters at the heart of the allegations have been and are being debated in the courts.
.The Committee also notes that the University states in the report forwarded by the Government that: () the national universities are entitled to appoint interim lecturers for a fixed period of time and without employment stability (the employment relationship of interim lecturers is not subject to trade union protection, which applies solely and exclusively during the period of their teaching appointments); () the position and status of trade union representative of the officials in question to no extent prevails over or decreases the strict temporary nature of the interim teaching appointment (according to the university this was confirmed by the judicial authority); () once the term of appointment as an interim lecturer has finished the mere fact of being a trade unionist does not entitle the worker in any way to demand another appointment in the same circumstances; () in all public universities employment stability is acquired through competition and not through trade union membership; () the supposedly dismissed lecturers belonged to three separate academic departments, which implies that to carry out the alleged persecution  democratically elected people would have had to be involved in a conspiracy; () at no time did the judicial authorities order the university to appoint the interim lecturers in question; () the lecturers in question flagrantly failed to fulfil their academic responsibilities; () the university respects the constitutional guarantee of free and democratic trade union organization; and () the ARDU organization represents .per cent of the , lecturers and  per cent of the academics at the university belong to another trade union organization.
.While noting the argument of the University pointing out the interim?status of the trade union officials subject to detrimental measures and the fact that the complainant organization ARDU has a very small membership, the Committee notes that it appears from the judgement transcribed by the Government, that by virtue of the officials?legally stipulated trade union protection ?even if these are interim and not permanent lecturers ?the university should have requested exclusion from that protection from the courts before carrying out dismissals or changes to working conditions. In this context, the Committee expresses its concern about the fact that according to the judgement transcribed by the Government, the University has not respected the procedures that protect trade union officials and that require judicial authorization for them to be dismissed or for their conditions of employment to be changed. The Committee expresses its concern, observing in particular that between April and January  a number of trade union officials from the ARDU organization have been dismissed and/or have suffered changes to their conditions of employment, which has given rise to various judicial proceedings, some of which are still pending.
.This being the case, observing that the legal system of protection against violations of trade union rights has been used by the complainants in the various cases indicated since , the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of all the judicial proceedings under way",-1,2008,Argentina
174,"relating to the allegations. Likewise, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that, in the future, if the University envisages dismissing or changing the conditions of employment of trade union officials, it is done in conformity with the trade union protection provided for under national legislation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of all the judicial proceedings under way relating to the allegations presented by the complainants against the National University of La Rioja.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that, in the future, if the University envisages dismissing or changing the conditions of employment of trade union officials who are entitled to trade union protection, it is done in conformity with the trade union protection provided for under national legislation.",-1,2008,Argentina

.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that union dues are withheld from the wages of members of APOC in the Court of Audit of Crdoba Province.(b) As regards the allegation that the administrative authority considered that APOC was not in a position to represent the workers in the negotiation of the working conditions of its employees in ENRE, in view of the contradictions between the allegations and the Governments reply, and the fact that APOC has trade union status and has been participating in the bargaining committee, the Committee requests the Government to verify once more whether the union lacks significant representativeness in ENRE. Moreover, given that what is at issue is the real representativeness of APOC, the Committee recalls that it is ultimately for the judicial authorities to take a decision in the matter.",-1,2008,Argentina
176,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of Customs Brokers (AEDA) dated April . Subsequently, the AEDA sent further information in communications dated June  and  February .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the present case, the AEDA challenges Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (Ministry of Labour) Decision No. / of  March  which, at the request of  union members (according to the AEDA, the union has a membership of , employees), declared null and void the decisions taken by the AEDA ordinary general assembly of  April , with regard to item  of the agenda (consideration of the report, balance sheet, inventory, statements of income and expenditure, and the report of the audit committee for the financial year ending December ). (Decision No. was revoked by the National Appeals Chamber on  December ). The AEDA also alleges that after it brought the complaint before the Committee, the National Directorate of Trade Unions, under the aegis of the Ministry of Labour, sought to suspend the members?assembly scheduled for  April , for dealing with the account statements for the  financial year (the complainant states that the administrative authority was instructed by a judicial decision to refrain from suspending, preventing or obstructing the AEDA ordinary general assembly and that this ruling was complied with, so this matter has been settled).
.In this regard, the Committee notes the Governments statement that: () according to the provisions of Act No. , section , which comes under the preliminary heading concerning the protection of freedom of association, workers have the right to participate in the internal affairs of their union, freedom of association ?whether individual, as in this case, or collective ?constitutes a fundamental human right, and hence the exercise of the workers?right to intervene in internal union affairs must be guaranteed by the State; ()that capacity must be preserved irrespective of the number of persons who allege that a right has been violated. Hence, the issue of numbers cannot be used as grounds for invalidating the submission made by the State; () the Ministry acted in response to a complaint from a union member who appeared to have been denied the possibility of exercising his right inasmuch as he had not been provided in due time and form with the requisite material for doing so; () the Ministry acted in accordance with section  of Act No. . A complaint was brought regarding the exclusion of  union members who were denied the possibility of examining the report and balance sheet, and this justified the intervention of the State in protecting this guaranteed workers?right which was violated in a democratic State; () there was no violation of the provisions of ILO Conventions Nos  and . The States action was directed at defending a fundamental right, namely worker action within the trade union; () when a complaint is presented under section  of Act No. , all that the Ministry of Labour can do is refer the matter to the [Appeals] Chamber. In other words, in the context of the judicial oversight of action taken by the administration, the Ministry is prohibited from making any pronouncement on any aspect thereof. The State must await the ruling of the division of the Chamber in which the appeal has been brought before deciding on its course of action; () the continuity of the States administrative activity is legitimate, as long as no contrary judicial ruling has been issued in human rights matters, as is the case here, because States have a primary duty to protect these guarantees; () the State complied with the injunction issued by the judiciary; () it is untrue that the administration cannot exercise administrative control inasmuch as a complaint of irregularity is provided for by section  of Act No. , which states that control of trade unions, even if they have obtained legal personality under the provisions of common law, shall be solely the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour. Such powers are subject in turn to the appropriate judicial controls; and () since the judicial phase following the amparo appeal filed by the complainant ?which gave rise to the preventive suspension of the challenged decision and this was complied with by the administration ?is in full progress, dealing with the matter in the Committee is a purely abstract exercise.
.The Committee observes firstly that, according to the statements made by the complainant organization in its communication of February  further to the Governments reply, the judicial authority ordered the revocation of the decision challenged in the present complaint. The Committee observes that the issue raised by the complainant in the present complaint has been settled but that an examination of its substance would still be of great interest to the complainant.
.With regard to the Governments arguments justifying its intervention in order to declare the AEDA general assembly null and void on the basis of a complaint from  union members and section  of Act No.  concerning trade unions, which states that control of trade unions shall be solely the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour, the Committee recalls that it has emphasized in this regard that there should be outside control only in exceptional cases, when there are serious circumstances justifying such action, since otherwise there would be a risk of limiting the right that workers?organizations have, by virtue of Article  of Convention No. , to organize their administration and activities without interference by the public authorities which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise. The Committee has considered that a law which confers the power to intervene on an official of the judiciary, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court, and which lays down that a request for intervention must be supported by a substantial number of those in the occupational category in question, does not violate these principles?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]
.In this regard, the Committee considers that  workers, representing . per cent of the , members of the trade union, do not constitute a substantial number of those in the occupational category in question such as to permit the administrative authority to restrict the activities of a trade union and disturb its normal functioning, especially where such administrative action is taken, as in the present case, without clear evidence or proof as expressly referred to by the ruling of the judicial authority (the complainant sent a copy of the ruling). The Committee therefore expects the Government to ensure that in the future the administrative authority refrains from intervening in trade union activities, for example by declaring a union assembly null and void, except in serious cases and at the request of a significant proportion of the members of the organization in question, or when intervention has been ordered by the judicial authority in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee, recalling Article  of Convention No. , expects the Government to ensure that in the future the administrative authority refrains from intervening in trade union activities, for example by declaring a union assembly null and void, except in serious cases and at the request of a significant proportion of the members of the organization in question, or when intervention has been ordered by the judicial authority in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.",0,2008,Argentina
177,".The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and on that occasion requested the Government to send its observations with regard to the communication from the Trade Union of Judicial Workers of Corrientes (SITRAJ) alleging that the authorities of the High Court of Justice of the Province of Corrientes had suspended one of the check-off codes (deductions for a refundable assistance fund) that was applicable to members and that deductions of union dues were made two months late, and also requested the Government to send its observations concerning information recently communicated by the Argentine Judicial Federation (FJA) (the FJA had objected to the transfer of the general secretary of the Association of Judicial Workers of La Rioja, Mr Horacio Rodolfo Jurez, from his post) [see th Report, paras ?].
.In a communication dated  February , the Government states with regard to the allegations presented by the SITRAJ that the High Court of Justice of the Province of Corrientes informed it that the deductions of union dues and membership contributions to the mutual fund were still being made, and that the only deductions that had been discontinued were those for mutual fund loans, which slightly affects the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to send its observations without delay concerning the information communicated by the FJA relating to the transfer of the general secretary of the Association of Judicial Workers of La Rioja, Mr Horacio Rodolfo Jurez, from his post.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting and on that occasion requested the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the complainant organizations (the Trade Union of Judicial Workers of Corrientes (SITRAJ) and the Argentine Judicial Federation (FJA)) and the High Court of Justice of the Province of Corrientes envisage the possibility of again granting union privileges, on the understanding that their exercise should not negatively affect the efficient functioning of the judiciary in the Province of Corrientes [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  March , SITRAJ states that as a consequence of the criminal complaints filed by the union against the court authorities and against the executive authorities of the province concerning dereliction of duty by public officials, fraud through mismanagement and the embezzlement of public funds, the court and the provincial authorities have suspended one of the check-off codes (cdigos de descuentos) (deductions for a refundable assistance fund) that was applicable to members and deductions of union dues are made two months late.
.The Committee requests the Government to send its observations with regard to this communication and recalls the principle that [t]he withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. Lastly, the Committee also asks the Government to send its observations in relation to the information recently communicated by the FJA.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in March , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ), paras ?].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its examination of this case at its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee expects that in future the authorities will endeavour to ensure compliance with the principle of the importance of dialogue and consultations on matters of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative occupational organizations of the sector involved and to promote collective bargaining, including on wages.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the allegations, presented in , that with the aim of intimidating the SITRAJ leadership, criminal charges for the alleged crime of fraud were brought against its general secretary and subsequently dismissed and requests it to establish an investigation to determine whether these charges had an anti-union intimidation or discrimination motive. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations relating to the allegations that by Decision No.  of  March  the trade union privileges enjoyed by three SITRAJ leaders were withdrawn for the purpose of weakening the complainant organization.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government forwarded the observations of the Higher Court of Justice of the Province of Corrientes.
.The authorities of the Higher Court of Justice of the Province of Corrientes state that they have been requested to communicate their observations on the allegations that, with the aim of intimidating the SITRAJ leadership, it brought criminal charges against its General Secretary for the alleged crime of fraud ?charges that were subsequently dismissed. They deny emphatically that the Court has brought criminal charges against any member of SITRAJ. Nevertheless, in order to clarify the situation, it conducted an inquiry among the various magistrates?courts of Corrientes to establish once and for all whether any criminal charge involving the trade union activities of any member of SITRAJ was pending. In the course of the inquiry, it was learnt from Resolution No.  dated  December  ?adopted by Magistrate No.  of the City of Corrientes in report No. / under the heading Lugo Juan Heriberto S/Dcia. P/Sup. Fraud ?Corrientes ?art.  C.P.P.: Gonzlez Juan Carlos?that Mr Juan Heriberto Lugo did indeed proffer charges against MrJuan Carlos Gonzlez for the alleged offence (article , para. , of the Penal Code) of fraudulent or disloyal administration, presumably on  December . According to the resolutions preambular paragraphs, in so far as the Public Prosecutor in agreement with the magistrate concerned determined that there were no grounds for proceeding further with the investigation since the alleged incident was not covered by any provision of the Penal Code, the case came under article  of the Code of Criminal Procedure and was accordingly dismissed. Consequently, as indicated above, the Higher Court of Justice has not brought charges against any member of SITRAJ.
.Regarding the alleged withdrawal of trade union privileges from three SITRAJ officers for the purpose of weakening the complainant organization, the authorities of the Higher Court of Justice state categorically that the circumstances were not as portrayed by SITRAJ and by the Argentine Judicial Federation (FJA). They also state that the Court did not act in any way that was designed to weaken the trade union organization referred to or intended as a form of reprisal. The events that gave rise to the incident originated in an official request that the President of the Public College of Lawyers of Corrientes submitted in administrative report No. C-- under the heading College of Lawyers ?First Constituency re. Request concerning the payment of wages of SITRAJ officers out of the budget of the Judiciary? The request called upon the Higher Court of Justice to revoke its earlier decision agreeing to the payment of the salaries of the persons filling the posts of General Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Financial Secretary of SITRAJ in the exercise of their trade union privileges, on the grounds that they should be remunerated by the trade union to which they are affiliated and not by the Judiciary, as required by law (article  of Act No. ).
.The Higher Court of Justice adds that, as a result of the request, a number of relevant Court documents and precedents were consulted. These show that: () by Decision No.  of , point , paragraph , two of the Courts officials were granted trade union privileges, including payment of salary by the Judiciary, and that by Decision No.  of , point, those privileges were subsequently extended to a third employee, again with payment of salary by the Judiciary; () by Decision No.  of , point , paragraph , it was decided to adapt the administrative arrangements to the requirements of Act No. and to grant trade union privileges to two officials of the Judiciary but without payment of salary by the Judiciary; () in  it was again decided to grant union privileges to three officials, in one case with payment of salary by the Judiciary (Federal Ruling, Decision No. /, point ). By Decision No.  of  (point ), such payment of salary by the Judiciary was extended to a second official, and by Decision No./ of  (point ) to all three officials.
.These precedents, together with the abovementioned administrative report, which was issued by the administrative director of the Judiciary on  September , establish that Juan Carlos Gonzlez, Adn Rodrguez and Epifanio Gmez received their income from the Judiciary and enjoyed trade union privileges. Responding to the request submitted by the College of Lawyers, and in accordance with the",-1,2007,Argentina
178,"Trade Union Associations Act No. that applies to SITRAJ, the Higher Court as presently constituted, under the presidency of [the undersigned], determined by Decision No.  of  March  (point ) to grant the executive committee of the trade union, to which the court officials of the Province of Corrientes are affiliated and whose legal personality as a trade union has been recognized, the right to union privileges without payment of salary by the Judiciary for the duration of their mandate and with due recognition of seniority .
.The request submitted by the College of Lawyers stated that it had learnt that the SITRAJ leadership, which at the time comprised the General Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Finance Secretary, were paid their salaries out of the budget of the Judiciary, whereas they should be paid by the union they represented inasmuch as they enjoy privileged status in respect of their trade union activities. This claim was based on the fact that union privileges were designed to ensure the stability of employment of their beneficiaries but did not justify paying a salary to people who did not provide any services. The College of Lawyers argued that it was absurd that those who called strikes and took decisions entailing a loss of earning for officials of the Judiciary (loss of work attendance bonus) should not themselves have their salaries docked. It concluded by pointing out that article of Act No.  clearly recognized that workers holding elective or representative posts within a trade union association were entitled to union privileges but without payment of their salary. That being so, the College of Lawyers requested that the decision granting trade union privileges with payment of salary be revoked.
.Notwithstanding the submission of the President of the College of Lawyers of the first judicial constituency, which was at the origin of this case, the Higher Court deemed it necessary to examine the provisions of article  of the Internal Rules of the Administration of Justice (RIAJ) in light of the relevant legal provisions in order to determine their legality. It accordingly compiled a list of precedents and previous agreements since the introduction of trade union privileges in the provincial Judiciary and verified the net monthly emoluments of Juan C. Gonzlez, Adn Rodrguez and Epifanio Gmez and the amounts paid to them as officials of the Judiciary whose posts were reserved. A closer look at the legislation revealed, first of all, that trade union privileges constituted a workers?right that was laid down in article bis of the national Constitution and article  of Act No.  as applying to any worker acting in the capacity of union representative. It is a right established by law for any trade union association that is empowered to request it and any employer entitled to grant it. Article  of the Trade Union Associations Act stipulates that workers who cease to provide services because they occupy elective or representative posts in trade union associations with legal personality shall automatically have the right to union privileges without payment of salary and to be reinstated in the same post upon termination of their union mandate?
.The concept of trade union privileges means that certain aspects of a work contract are suspended if, by the nature of the post and the duties associated with it, the union duties require a workers full-time presence and are therefore in practice incompatible with the simultaneous performance of the contractual duties (cf. Corte, Nstor: El modelo sindical argentino, page ). This right, which is expressly provided for by law, comes into play automatically as soon as a worker ceases to provide services so as to engage in trade union activities. However, a worker may choose not to exercise that right, like any other right, and in practice many union officials do continue to provide services during their mandate without exercising such a privilege. If, for instance, a worker should for any reason decide to return to his post, the employer ?who must keep the post available ?must reinstate him in the undertaking. Moreover, the privilege provides for the suspension of only certain features of the work contract (cf.Chapter X of the Labour Contract Act, article , and article  of Trade Union Associations Act No. ), notably its material benefits, i.e. remuneration and services rendered. From a strictly literal interpretation of article  of Act No. , the fact is that the privilege conferred does not include the payment of salary, especially where it takes precedence as a legal standard over the Rules. Thus, the Higher Court of Justice argues that article  of Act  was wrongly interpreted inasmuch as the possibility was recognized under article  of the RIAJ to confer on officials elected to represent a trade union an entitlement to union privileges for the duration of their mandate and with payment of salary. This, it states, is clearly incompatible both with the legal standard cited above and with established precedents with regard to the payment of remuneration without the provision of services in return.
.The Higher Court goes on to state that the concept of protection of trade union representatives, and specifically of the right to union privileges, is based on the fact that the post is reserved for the worker concerned for the duration of his or her mandate, but without payment of salary. And although in recent time such privileges have been granted with payment of salary, the Court has done so on the basis of the Rules in force, notwithstanding the fact that the union privileges conferred under article  of Act No. should be without payment of salary, since such payment can be neither assumed nor financed by the Judiciary in its capacity as employer.
.The Court adds that, although the payment was agreed to at the time, it did not imply any acquired right or create an expectation that those Rules would continue to operate in the same way as they did when the union privileges were granted previously. Consequently, it was unquestionably the trade union itself that should pay its representatives their remuneration. It states further that the said remuneration is determined by the effective and regular provision of services due by the worker, that being the legal justification for the latters entitlement to it. In other words, the entitlement exists only is so far as services are actually rendered, whereas the union privileges that are granted for the performance of trade union activities are not designed for the same purpose and are not an inherent part of the labour relationship, which is concerned with the effective provision of services. Consequently, no remuneration can be deemed due whose justification derives from the actual fulfilment of the labour relationship. It should further be noted, according to the Higher Court, that the legal relationship of a trade unions representative with the union is not that of a labour relationship (cf. article  of the Labour Contract Act), but rather an institutional relationship, as a result of the workers post and responsibilities within the union, as provided for in article  of Act No. . That is to say that, for as long as workers are paid union officials with duties within a trade union, they are not bound by a contractual labour relationship but by a legal and institutional relationship deriving from their union status. This assertion is supported by those who maintain that union privileges do not include payment of salaries and that, in the event that remuneration is in fact paid, then by virtue of the union representatives institutional relationship with the trade union, it does not constitute remuneration for labour ?even though it is calculated in the same way ?but rather a form of financial compensation that is equal in amount to the salary the worker received for services rendered to the enterprise, often with the additional reimbursement of costs incurred as a result of the workers activities as a trade union representative. In other words, trade union privileges do not entail payment of salary and, even if occupational associations normally do compensate in some way the earnings foregone by persons taking on union duties, that does not imply that the trade union association concerned can be considered the union officials employer, since between the official and the union there exists no labour relationship in the sense of articles ,  and  of the Labour Contracts Act.
.Even when the beneficiaries are actually exercising their trade union privileges, the existing arrangement can perfectly well be modified in the future, and this should be interpreted neither as a restriction on the full exercise of their duties as union representatives, which they should continue to perform till the end of their mandate, nor as a way of hindering the full exercise of freedom of association as guaranteed by the Constitution (article bis of the national Constitution and article  of the Trade Union Associations Act). The fact is that it is in any case desirable to also limit the number of trade",-1,2007,Argentina
179,"union privileges that are granted to officials of the Judiciary serving as union representatives, so as to ensure the continuity and regularity of the services rendered by the Judiciary. Indeed, inasmuch as article  of the RIAJ contradicts and infringes the principles of labour legislation and Act No. , it should, for all the reasons adduced, be brought into line with the legal provisions in force.
.Finally, the Higher Court of Justice states that it is precisely in this spirit that provision was made for union privileges in article  of the Rules governing the Assistance and Privileges of Magistrates, Officials and Employees of the Judiciary (RAL), that was approved by Extraordinary Decision No. /, i.e. the decision handed down by the Higher Court of Justice along with other matters in respect of which SITRAJ lodged the appeal that was denied by Decision No. /, point . Despite the fact that the aforementioned Rules are still in force, by Decision No. , point , of  December , the Higher Court ordered the provisional suspension of articles Nos ? of the RAL. Following consultation of the Public Prosecutor of the Judiciary, it was decided to waive the suspension ordered by Decision No. /, point  ?which related solely to the first (and still suspended) part of article  of the RAL modifying article  of the RIAJ. Point of Decision No. / reads as follows: Art. : Trade union privileges: The executive committee of the trade union to which officials of the Judiciary of the province are affiliated and whose juridical personality has been recognized, may grant trade union privileges to one official ?which official shall have been duly elected to act in the capacity of titular member of the said committee ?without payment of salary and for the duration of his or her mandate with due recognition of seniority. At the end of that mandate the official must return to work within five consecutive days, failing which he or she may be dismissed. During the period covered by union privileges, the Higher Court of Justice may provisionally replace the official concerned?
.According to the Higher Court of Justice, the foregoing considerations outline briefly the political, institutional and legal context in which it operates and could be expanded upon if necessary. The Higher Court adds that it is and has always been committed to the full protection of its employees, including their remuneration as determined by their grade and place in the hierarchy, within the framework of its budgetary restrictions and of the economic circumstances in which Argentines society finds itself. The appeals that were lodged with other national authorities were dealt with in a spirit of institutional dialogue, without infringing in any way the independence of the Judiciary. The goals that have been set for the Higher Court of Justice as presently constituted are being diligently pursued, with an eye to correcting the deficiencies of a system of administration of justice that suffers from chronic shortcomings and to ensuring that justice is dispensed more efficiently in the service of society. As regards its human resources management policy, the objective of the Higher Court is to ensure that every department of the Judiciary has adequate and appropriate human resources to guarantee the efficiency of the services provided. The Higher Court has reorganized the judicial career of officials in the administrative sector and in the maintenance and services sector, so that they can invest themselves in their jobs according to the competence and efficiency with which they perform their duties. Initially, this has meant modifying existing rules and procedures on the basis of an analysis and final diagnosis whereby it has been possible to redistribute the duties pertaining to each sector equitably and in keeping with the structure of the Judiciary throughout the province, while at the same time correcting inequities and shortening the time needed for the various categories of employees to progress in their careers.
.It is in line with the above that Decision No. / was adopted in order to implement a system of redistributing posts for purposes of promotion which has meant reorganizing those posts in keeping with the availability of resources. The process began in February  and to date has benefited . per cent of the overall staff of both sectors. In pursuit of its goal of creating conditions that are conducive to career development in the Judiciary, the Higher Court has focused on introducing a fair and objective skills assessment system that encourages promotion, for which purpose it has drawn up and approved a corresponding workplan as an integral part of Decision No. /.
.The Committee recalls that, when it examined this case at its meeting in March , it requested the Government to send its observations concerning the allegations that, with the aim of intimidating the SITRAJ leadership, criminal charges for the alleged crime of fraud were brought against its General Secretary and subsequently dismissed, and that by Decision No.  of  March  the trade union privileges enjoyed by three SITRAJ leaders were withdrawn for the purpose of weakening the complainant organization.
.With respect to the allegation that, with the aim of intimidating the SITRAJ leadership, criminal charges for the alleged crime of fraud were brought against its General Secretary that were subsequently dismissed, the Committee notes that the Government has communicated the observations of the Higher Court of Justice of the Province of Corrientes, to the effect that: () the Higher Court has not brought criminal charges against any member of SITRAJ; () Mr Juan Heriberto Lugo brought charges against MrJuan Carlos Gonzlez for the alleged crime of fraudulent or disloyal administration, presumably in December ; and () according to the preambular paragraphs of Resolution No.  of  December  adopted by Magistrate No.  of the City of Corrientes, there were no grounds for proceeding any further with the investigation since the alleged incident was not covered by any provision of the Penal Code, and the case was accordingly dismissed. In the light of this information, the Committee does not intend to pursue the examination of these allegations any further.
.As regards the allegation that by Decision No.  of  March  the trade union privileges exercised by three SITRAJ leaders were withdrawn for the purpose of weakening the complainant organization, the Committee notes the Higher Court of Justices statement that the circumstances were not as portrayed by the complainant organizations, and that the Court did not act in any way that was designed to weaken SITRAJ or intended as a form of reprisal. Specifically, the Higher Court states: () that the events that gave rise to the incident originated in an official request to the Court from the President of the Public College of Lawyers of Corrientes, contained in the administrative report College of Lawyers ?First Constituency re. Request concerning the payment of wages of SITRAJ officers out of the budget of the Judiciary? calling on the Higher Court of Justice to revoke its earlier agreement to the payment of salaries due to persons filling the posts of General Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Financial Secretary of SITRAJ and benefiting from trade union privileges, since they should be remunerated by the trade union to which they are affiliated and not by the Judiciary; () that by Decision No.  of , two of the Courts officials were granted trade union privileges, including payment of salary by the Judiciary, and that by Decision No.  of  such privileges were subsequently extended to a third employee, again with payment of salary by the Judiciary; () that by Decision No.  of , it was resolved to bring the administrative arrangement into line with Act No.  and to grant trade union privileges to two officials of the Judiciary but without payment of salary; () that it was resolved by Decision No.  of  to accord union privileges to three officials, in one case with payment of salary by the Judiciary, and by Decision No.  of  to extend payment of salary to three officials; () that, in the light of the administrative report stating that Juan Carlos Gonzlez, Adn Rodrguez and Epifanio Gmez received their salary from the Judiciary and had been granted trade union privileges, the Higher Court, responding to the submission of the College of Lawyers and in accordance with the Trade Unions Associations Act, resolved by Decision No.  of  March  to grant the executive committee of SITRAJ the right to union privileges without payment of salary for the duration of its mandate; () that article  of the Trade Union Associations Act stipulates that workers who cease to provide services because they occupy elective or representative posts in trade union associations with legal personality have automatically the right to union privileges without entitlement to salary and to be reinstated in the same post upon termination of their union mandate; () that, although the payment was agreed to at the time, it did not imply any acquired",-1,2007,Argentina
180,"right or create an expectation that those Rules would continue to operate in the same way as they did when the union privileges were granted previously; () that, even if the beneficiaries are actually exercising their trade union privileges, the existing arrangement can perfectly well be modified in the future, and this should be interpreted neither as a restriction on the full exercise of their union duties nor as a way of hindering the full exercise of freedom of association; and () that it is desirable to limit the number of trade union privileges that are granted to officials of the Judiciary serving as union representatives, so as to ensure the continuity and regularity of the services rendered by the Judiciary.
.In this regard, the Committee wishes to point out that Paragraph , subparagraph , of the Workers?Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), stipulates that workers?representatives should be afforded the necessary time off from work, without loss of pay or social and fringe benefits, for carrying out their representation functions. Subparagraph  of the same Paragraph adds that, although a workers?representative may be required to obtain permission from the management before taking time off from work, such permission should not be unreasonably withheld. That being so, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that, bearing in mind the aforementioned principles and the fact that SITRAJ has already been granted union privileges with payment of salary for three officials, the complainant organizations and the Higher Court of Justice of the Province of Corrientes envisage the possibility of again granting such privileges, on the understanding that their exercise should not negatively affect the efficient functioning of the Judiciary.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the complainant organizations and the Higher Court of Justice of the Province of Corrientes envisage the possibility of again granting such union privileges, on the understanding that their exercise should not negatively affect the efficient functioning of the Judiciary in the Province of Corrientes.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the Trade Union of Judicial Workers of Corrientes (SITRAJ) and the Argentine Judicial Federation (FJA) dated  and November . By communications dated  January and  July , SITRAJ sent additional information in connection with its complaint.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications dated  and  November , SITRAJ and the FJA state that in October , the Higher Court of Justice of Corrientes submitted to the executive its draft multi-year budget for  together with its projections for  and . The amount in question was considered by the executives Ministry of Finance, which asked that it be reduced. By Decision No.  of  November , the Higher Court of Justice resolved not to entertain a reformulation of the budget and to confirm its presentation thereof for the periods in question and in the amounts requested in accordance with the Act on Financial Independence of the Judiciary?(Act No. , section ). Despite that confirmation, the legislature, in approving the overall budget for the province, did so without respecting the independence of the judiciary. In November , the provincial executive approved a  per cent salary increase for the civil service, effective as from the first of that month, with a subsequent  per cent increase as from  May  by DecreeNo. /. Following repeated complaints, partial success was achieved in securing the same salary policy as had been implemented by the provincial executive for the civil service and by the legislature for its employees, with an increase of  per cent being secured on  February of this year, and  per cent on  August, by extraordinary Decision No. , leaving  per cent still outstanding for the judiciary. It was this that sparked the current crisis.
.The complainants state that on  June , it was agreed in an extraordinary general assembly to take direct action in the form of work stoppages on  and  June and  July, in view of the lack of any response to the calls for a salary increase. In an unexpected move, and in the absence of any conciliation or of the direct action being declared illegal, the court ordered the deduction of two days of salary from those having participated in the two days of direct action in June. In the face of this response it was resolved, by decisions taken during recesses of the extraordinary assembly (on  and  July,  and  August, and  September, and  and  October), to continue with direct action in the form of work stoppages on two days in July ( and ), four days in August (, ,  and ), ten days in September (, , , , , , , ,  and ) and  days in October(, , , , , , , , , ,  and ).
.The complainants add that an appeal for the protection of constitutional rights (amparo) was also submitted, on  July, under the terms of articles  and () of the National Constitution and article  of the Provincial Constitution against the state of the province of Corrientes (Judiciary) on account of the certain and imminent threat of measures to dock the salaries of judiciary employees having participated in the direct action ?work stoppages ?called by SITRAJ, through an infringement of constitutional rights on the part of the Higher Court of Justice. The supreme organ of the provinces judiciary is currently on the point of restricting, distorting and threatening, in a manner that is clearly arbitrary and illegal, constitutional rights and guarantees such as the right to strike, which is recognized under article bis of the National Constitution and under numerous international treaties. Similarly, a precautionary measure was requested in order to have the supreme organ refrain from engaging in measures to dock the salaries of employees participating in direct action, and to have it ordered that any amounts thus docked or due to be docked be repaid, and that the matter be brought before Civil and Commercial Court No.  of the first district (file No. /). This judicial authority handed down decision No.  of  September , in which it decided: ?) to rule in favour of the present appeal for amparo and consequently to order the state of the province of Corrientes (judiciary) to refrain from docking the salaries of judicial employees on the grounds of presenteeism or any other grounds having to do with the direct action involving work stoppages called by SITRAJ, as from the start of that action and until actual notification hereof, and to repay all amounts thus docked?
.The complainants further state that by Resolution No.  of  August , it was decided to accept the precautionary measure and, by virtue thereof, to order the state of the province of Corrientes (judiciary) to refrain from docking, as from the month of July and thereafter, the salaries of judiciary employees having participated, or who may participate, in the direct action called for by SITRAJ, whether on the grounds of presenteeism or on any other salary-related grounds, while the case is being examined and until the final judgment is rendered in regard to the substance of the matter in dispute? The precautionary measure was appealed against by the provincial state, in response to which the trade union entered a challenge for cause in regard to the judges and President of the Higher Court of Justice for having expressed an opinion in advance of the trial (bypronouncing the decisions and ordering the docking of salaries and, ultimately, by having been the one who signed, as President of the Higher Court of Justice and on behalf of the judicial authority, the response to the amparo, thereby becoming both judge and party). Likewise, under the Act on Administrative Procedures, No. , it is stipulated in section X, under the heading Self-disqualification and challenge? section (b) in fine, that: ?However, no one having previously exercised an administrative, legislative or judicial function in a given case may intervene in that same case in the exercise of one of the other functions ? When the matter came before it, the Higher Court of Justice rejected the challenge for cause and decided to appeal against the precautionary measure, which it revoked, at the same time rejecting the extraordinary federal appeal. This prompted the complainant organization to lodge a remedy of complaint with the Supreme Court of Justice of the nation, calling for the decisions of the challenged judges to be declared null and void and/or for the revocation of the precautionary measure to be declared null and void. It has thus far received",4,2007,Argentina
181,"no response.
.On  August, a submission was made to the Higher Court of Justice, reiterating the urgent need for a response in the matter of the  per cent shortfall in the salary increase requested (file No. S-/) for all employees of the provinces Judiciary, since the issue was one of subsistence, the main supporting argument being that the same salary policy should be implemented for the judiciary as for the executive, through decrees and by decision of the Legislature.
.The complainants state that, on  August , following the communication in the normal manner of a note announcing the outcome of the extraordinary assembly, the Higher Court of Justice announced that it required an authentic copy of the minutes of the assembly, together with records in the form of the books and tables drawn up for the purpose of registering the attendance of members at the assembly (article  of the SITRAJ statute), on pain of sanction in the event of non-compliance? This was met with petitions requesting clarification, there being no indication as to why something never previously requested was now being called for, or on what legal basis details were being requested whose inspection fell solely within the competence of the body responsible for supervising trade unions, namely the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security of the nation. On  October, against a backdrop of persistent reports of amounts having been docked from salaries corresponding to the months of July and August, a note was sent to the Director of Administration informing her of the status of the amparo request, in response to which the Higher Court of Justice ordered that the docking of salaries should now cover the months of July, August and September (a total of  days), with the month of October not being included since it was not yet over.
.The complainants state that on  October , the Higher Court of Justice rendered Decision No. , which, in point , regulates the right to strike and constitutes a clear subjugation of the practice of freedom of association. An appeal for reconsideration was entered against that decision (file No. S--), calling for its annulment on the grounds that it sought to regulate, unreasonably and with a clear overuse of authority, a right that was enshrined in article bis of the National Constitution and requesting that its effects be suspended pending settlement of the matter. Such suspension was rejected by Resolution No. /, against which an appeal for reconsideration was entered, together with reservations as to the making of all necessary administrative and judicial representations at the national and international levels.
.A corresponding complaint was also made to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security by the Argentine Judicial Federation, the same complaint being made to the Ministrys Corrientes office by SITRAJ, the said office having replied (on  October) that subjugation of the practice of freedom of association?lay beyond the competence of the Ministry. Nevertheless, and should the parties so decide? they would act as intermediaries? On  October, the recess of the extraordinary assembly was continued, during the course of which it was decided: to repudiate Decision No. , point , which limits freedom of association and prohibits the right to strike, to accept the offer by the Corrientes office of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security to act as an intermediary? and to suspend the pursuit of direct action ?work stoppages ?owing to the possible threat of loss of the source of labour.
.The complainants consider that the conduct on the part of the Higher Court of Justice and the text of Decision No. , point , highlight the grievances behind their complaint. First, in the preambular part of the decision in question, the following interpretation is made of the content of the Trade Union Act: point IV of the reasons disregards the obligatory conciliation procedure provided for by Decree No. / within the provincial territory. The complainants wonder whether each ministry or each authority has powers to regulate the right to strike. As they see it, it would appear to be so at the provincial level, since as judicial employees they are governed by Decision No. , point , which in turn leaves aside Act No. , which is the act that governs the trade union status accorded to SITRAJ under Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security Resolution No. /.
.The complainants add that point  of the decision regulates the manner in which control is exercised over the minimum requirements of accreditation and negotiation of conflicts within the Higher Court of Justice ? now exercising the powers of supervision and control that correspond to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and requiring the presentation of documents on pain of ?taking judicial steps to have the action taken declared illegal? In the view of the complainants, the arguments put forward by the provinces Higher Court of Justice undermine its institutional standing inasmuch as they seek, in an unlawful and dogmatic manner, to regulate the right of associations to take direct action. They consider it unworkable for the Higher Court of Justice of Corrientes to attempt to regulate matters pertaining to trade union rights.
.The complainants further state that Decision No. / also wrongs them inasmuch as its point  provides ?that prior to resorting to direct action, the Higher Court of Justice shall be informed of the reasons for the conflict, which must be of a labour-related nature, together with any suggestions deemed relevant, to which end the corresponding record shall be drawn up in the presence of the administrative secretary? In point  of its operative part, the decision goes on to provide as follows: In like manner, it shall ?in the event that it is decided to undertake direct action liable to result in the suspension, interruption or shutdown of the services provided by judicial employees, by means of their withdrawal from the workplace or by other means ?give advance notice to the Higher Court of Justice in due form and no later than five days before the date on which the action is due to begin, providing it with the outcome of the extraordinary assembly which, having been convened solely for that purpose, decided in favour of such action by at least a twothirds majority of those in attendance and entitled to vote (sections (j) and  of the Statute of the Trade Union of Judicial Workers) ...?
.The complainants affirm that, as if the Higher Court of Justices arrogation of legislative powers were not enough, point  of the operative part of Decision No. / provides that in the event of it being decided to resort to direct action, copies shall be submitted of the executive committees call to assembly, of the agreement and resolution and of the ad hoc book or list recording the attendance of members at the assembly. The complainants wonder which provision of the National Constitution or Provincial Constitution, or of an international treaty, has been taken as a basis for establishing that the employer is to supervise and inspect the calling of its employees to an extraordinary assembly.
.In point  of Decision No. / it is established that in the event that the obligation to inform the Higher Court of Justice of the reasons for the conflict is not complied with; that those reasons are not labour-related; that the decision to resort to direct action is not taken in conformity with sections (j) and  of the Statute of the Trade Union of Judicial Workers; or that the obligation to provide a copy of the executive committees call to assembly, of the agreement and resolution and of the ad hoc book or list recording the attendance of members at the assembly is not complied with, the Higher Court of Justice may take legal steps to have the direct action declared unlawful? The complainants hold that, under this provision, the Higher Court of Justice is acting as both judge and party, it being for this reason that they have lodged a complaint with the Supreme Court of Justice of the nation.
.The complainants likewise object to point  of Decision No. /, which states that: on the day immediately following the day on which advance notice is given, the minimum services to be maintained during the conflict, the arrangements for their provision and the staff to be assigned to provide them shall be established in accordance with the past practice of the Higher Court of Justice referred to in the preambular part hereof? The complainants state that resolutions by which extraordinary assemblies resolve to engage in direct action ?work stoppages ?provide for one working day to enable magistrates and officials to call for, or establish shifts, in case the direct action attracts a very large following, with courts of first instance and public prosecution teams being exempted.
.The complainants consider that under this decision, in the event of a labour-related conflict, it is required that the members of the SITRAJ executive shall first appear",-1,2007,Argentina
182,"before the administrative secretary, inform him of the reasons and provide him with suggestions to be included in the record. No mention is made of dialogue with the Higher Court of Justice, of reconciliation between the two parties (employer and union), or of seeking solutions or agreements. Then, although the response is not known, it is necessary to give advance notice, five days ahead of the action, of the outcome of the extraordinary assembly, which, under the terms of the Statute it is not possible to do since the calling of a stoppage or strike is a defensive measure that can be taken only in extremis. In the event that such a call is issued on any grounds other than those specified in section (j), or that those reasons are not labour-related? for example, modification of the unions statute (subparagraph (a)); under this decision, the Higher Court of Justice may take legal steps to have the direct action declared unlawful? In the complainants?view, this is another clear example of the restrictions being imposed on freedom of association by the Higher Court of Justice.
.The complainants maintain that the decision about which they are complaining is unlawful inasmuch as it regulates, in a unilateral and arbitrary manner, the exercise of trade union rights ?something which no legislator has done. The deviations that are occurring are causing harm to judicial employees in particular, but also have negative repercussions for the entire spectrum of workers and their unions, for whom there is henceforth a precedent that can be drawn upon when it comes to limiting the union activities in their respective companies or state entities. However, the interference by the Higher Court of Justice of Corrientes does not end here, since not only does it regulate the law but also sets itself up as the implementing authority for verification and examination of trade union activities. According to the complainants, the justice service has not been affected in its work, bearing in mind that only a part of the judicial community is represented by SITRAJ, it being the responsibility of the magistrates and officials, within whose power it lies, to provide the information that the court requires.
.The complainants state that, as a consequence of the above situation, they have requested the intervention of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security of the nation, through a complaint lodged with the Corrientes office and another with the central office, in the interests of putting an end to the arbitrariness and serious violation of freedom of association on the part of the Higher Court of Justice. This resulted in the opening of file No. ---, in which the conflict is described in detail and in which the aforementioned Ministry states that the matter falls outside the scope of its competence inasmuch as it has to do with a case of unfair practice under the terms of section  of ActNo. , calling for recourse to judicial channels, in which matter it would be prepared to act as a mediator? In this regard, the Higher Court of Justice of the province of Corrientes refuses to recognize the mandatory conciliation procedure provided for in section  of Act No. , maintaining that those regulations do not apply to conflicts arising within the provincial territory, or to accept the mediation offer by the Corrientes office of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which is not mandatory. It is for this reason, with all internal procedures at the national, administrative and judicial levels having been exhausted, that the complainants have seen fit to lodge the present complaint, having regard to the legal considerations that are set forth below.
.According to the complainants, various situations have arisen that amount to a serious violation of internationally-recognized principles ?incorporated into Argentinas domestic legislation ?designed to guarantee freedom of association.
.The complainant organizations allege that the Higher Court of Justice, in issuing Decision No. (), is seeking to regulate aspects of trade union rights (timing and arrangements for the holding of extraordinary assemblies and the corresponding quorum) that lie wholly outside its sphere of competence as a public authority. The complainants assert that there can be absolutely no disputing the fact that the strike, as a form of direct action aimed at bringing about certain changes in the employers behaviour ?changes that can involve either adopting new behaviour or dropping an existing one ?is protected under the Constitution and constitutes a legitimate right in the sphere of labour relations. This constitutional right is exercised as a means of demanding the right to a decent wage, based on the family expenditure level, while at the same time the exercise of that right places a burden, to a greater or lesser extent, on the party against whom it is directed.
.At the national level, the right to strike is enshrined in Act No. , known as the Labour Organization Act, which regulates the right to strike in such a way as to lend greater effectiveness to the constitutional guarantee in keeping with the interests of the State, ensuring the essential values of social coexistence, while setting limits on that regulation, which is confined to essential services and is subject to the principles and criteria established by the ILO in that regard and incorporated into Argentine law. The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security is the authority with the competence to exercise such regulation at its discretion and the only entity capable of determining the legitimacy or otherwise of the strike, not having declared it to be unlawful in the present case, while the Higher Court of Justice has no authority to determine the legitimacy of the strike or, even more to the point, to regulate it.
.In its communication dated  January , SITRAJ raises objections to new decisions relating to sick leave arrangements, and to the administrative rule of procedure for the judgment of breaches of discipline on the part of magistrates, officials and employees of the judiciary. The complainant organization adds that, on  November, criminal charges relating to fraud were unexpectedly brought against the general secretary of SITRAJ, MrJuan Carlos Gonzlez, for a matter going back to . The complaint was lodged by an employee not associated with the entity, and the proceedings were anything but usual, it having been stated that the intention was to intimidate the unions leadership. The complaint was dismissed owing to the absence of any crime.
.The complainant organization insists that the behaviour on the part of the Higher Court of Justice and the text of Decision No. (), which amounts quite simply to a negation of the right to strike, concealing the wrongful persecution being carried out through the obvious abuse, overuse or misuse of power, since authority is being exercised for a stated purpose (ensuring an adequate justice service), while the true purpose lies elsewhere, namely in the restriction of freedom of association involving interference in the unions activities and the imposition of different regulations and a supervisory body other than the one provided for in Act No. .
.In its communication dated  July , SITRAJ adds that the Higher Court of Justice of the province of Corrientes, not content merely to have adopted Decision No.  of October , which rules out the right to strike, has gone still further in its efforts to cut back on freedom of association by interfering in the activities of the union of judicial workers, imposing different regulations and a supervisory body other than the one provided for in Act No. .
.SITRAJ adds that on  February , by judicial Decision No. , the Higher Court of Justice of the province of Corrientes rejected the appeal for reconsideration submitted by SITRAJ in regard to Decision No. () and confirmed each and every one of the factual and legal grounds for the existence of Decision No. ()? This judicial decision amounts to a restatement of the reasonings already expressed, using different nuances and words, in Decision No. , seeking to justify the unjustifiable, namely curtailment of the right to strike and interference in the internal affairs of a trade union, in other words causing injury by its efforts to confer legitimacy on a curtailment of the rights that are recognized and protected under section bis of the National Constitution. This lengthy decision fails to take account of the fundamental fact that the right to strike?is the very last tool to which a union has recourse when all other avenues have been exhausted, and that SITRAJ has only ever made use of it in this way. Nor does it say anything about SITRAJ various requests received by the Higher Court of Justice, which was not even prepared to receive the new members of the executive committee, despite the requests made to that end, which have remained unanswered. SITRAJ wonders how the Court can expect to comply with its duty to engage in prior dialogue?if it never grants an audience.
.SITRAJ states that on  March , the Higher Court of Justice rendered Decision No. ,",-1,2007,Argentina
183,"item , which withdrew the trade union privileges enjoyed by three members of the executive committee (general secretary, deputy secretary and treasurer), spuriously basing its action on section  of the Act on Trade Union Associations (No. ). Furthermore, in the operative part of item , the Court resolved to lift the suspension provided for under Decision No. /(), solely with respect to section , first part (hitherto suspended), which modified the current section , and granted entitlement to leave without pay while maliciously not implementing the second part by which trade union leave is granted. SITRAJ sees this as evidence of patent animosity towards the members of its executive committee and as an attempt to weaken SITRAJ as a part of its ongoing curtailment of the rights of workers who are constantly being subjugated by the Higher Court of Justice. This then completes the curtailment of freedom of association, since the SITRAJ representatives are able to perform their representative duties only during the three hours of leave that are granted to them as employees of the judiciary.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government emphasizes that the acts to which the complaint refers are those of an independent authority (the judiciary) of a provincial government (that of the province of Corrientes), and that by virtue of the federal form of government and principle of independence of authorities, the national Government must proceed with the greatest caution and the utmost respect for these constitutional principles. It is for this reason that the complaint was transferred to the Higher Court of Justice of the province of Corrientes, which presented its observations in regard to the case in question. The Government adds that, over and above those observations by the Higher Court of Justice, whose report is attached, in the present case it is necessary to abide by the relevant decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, namely that officials working in the administration of justice and the judiciary are officials who exercise authority in the name of the State and whose right to strike could thus be subject to restrictions, such as its suspension or even prohibition? and that staff in the judiciary should be considered as public servants exercising authority in the name of the State and, as a result, the authorities may suspend the exercise of the right to strike of this staff? The Government points out that at no time in the case in question was the right to strike prohibited or suspended, but that the minimum measures were adopted to ensure that the judiciary would be able to maintain an emergency service during the period of the strike.
.In his report, the President of the Higher Court of Justice of the province of Corrientes states that the decisive circumstances resulting in the decision to establish a framework for the right to strike of judicial employees and harmonize the exercise of that right such as to ensure that the essential rights of individuals are not undermined, by maintaining non-postponable services pertaining to their liberty and to public safety, stem from considerations both legislative, i.e. the absence of any procedure at the provincial level for handling strikes by judicial employees, and factual, including: (a) the exercise of that right in  by judicial employees; who on several occasions and with varying scope took the concerted decision to pursue direct action and then to maintain it, abandoning their duties after having signed the daily timesheets. In its report of  February , the staffing and leave division of the Corrientes judicial authority stated that employee participation had been recorded in the stoppages arranged by SITRAJ on  and  June; ,  and  July; , ,  and  August; , , , , , , , ,  and  September; , , , , , , , , , ,  and  October , making a total of  days; and (b) the difficulties reported by the Supreme Council comprising the law societies of Corrientes, Goya, Santo Tom, Curuz Cuata and Paso de los Libres on account of the negative effects produced by the repeated action taken by the union, in the absence of conciliation.
.The report states that such events gave rise to serious discussion, given the importance in such circumstances, and perhaps all the more so because of them, to find a way through that accommodated the various interests while ensuring that one sectors pursuit of its specific aims does not undermine the rights of any other sector. For these reasons, and given the existence of regulations at the national level (Decree No. /) in regard to the provisions of section  of Act No.  (relating to the adoption of direct action in the context of activities that may be considered essential services) ?which was deemed to be inapplicable to labour conflicts arising on provincial territory through the express application of the provisions of articles ,  and  of the National Constitution, in the same way as it was deemed impossible for the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security to interfere in conflicts involving employees of the judicial authority of the province of Corrientes (a lack of jurisdiction not discussed by that Ministry when it learned of the situation from SITRAJ) ?it was decided to adopt measures aimed at establishing a framework for the exercise of the right to strike.
.The report goes on to state that, as was the case when the decision was rendered in regard to the appeal for revocation lodged by SITRAJ against the provisions of Decision No./(), the competence of the Supreme Court of Justice to act in the way that it did has constitutional and legal backing since, under the framework established by articles () and  of the Provincial Constitution, the duties of this body include issuing decisions and regulations for the purpose of giving effect to the Constitution and organizational act on the courts, and exercising oversight in regard to the administration of justice. The word oversight?signifies ultimate oversight of a branch? this constituting an intrinsic duty of the Higher Courts or Courts of Justice in order to govern?the judiciary. This implies decentralized legislation, distribution and implementation as institutional guarantees or safeguards for adequate fulfilment of the role that the Constitution assigns to this authority and clearly refers to the entitys decentralized competence, separate from the central administration, whereby the judiciary is responsible for determining its own decision-making powers and administering its own activities.
.Within this framework, the provinces Supreme Court is responsible for administering its own organization, bearing in mind that the administrative judicial machinery of the judiciary raises very delicate issues in regard to the management and use of the human, technological and financial resources assigned to enable it to perform its basic and essential functions, and in the exercise of those rights and in the aspect pertaining to the effective provision of the justice service, for which the Higher Court of Justice is the main custodian and responsible entity (being empowered to issue decisions for the purpose of improving its services and to exercise oversight in regard to all employees of the provinces justice administration, in application of the duties and authority accorded to it by the Provincial Constitution for the effective consolidation of its work), it is logical and reasonable, when faced with the situation referred to in point  of the contested decision, as in the case of the concerted adoption by judicial employees in , on various occasions and with varying scope, of ongoing direct action whereby they abandoned their duties after signing the daily timesheets, that the Court should have taken appropriate measures to balance the interests at stake; on the one hand, the need to ensure the uninterrupted provision of the justice service, seen as an essential service for the community and, on the other hand, the need to ensure respect for the fundamental right to strike. The balance to be achieved, then, is between the aforementioned interest of the community at large and the right of workers to take direct action.
.Let it be recalled that the justice service entrusted to this provincial state authority constitutes a function in its own right that is essential and cannot be delegated and whose implementation and efficient provision fall chiefly to the Higher Court of Justice, which is the reason why these internal measures were adopted in order to adapt the constitutional exercise of the right to strike in such a way as to avoid situations that could result in the possible disruption or degradation of the service. The principles of efficiency, effectiveness and uninterrupted service provision are of particular significance when it comes to organization of the justice service, on account of the exclusivity of the public functions concerned; hence the emphasis on the absolute need to ensure their provision. In short, the competence in question stems from the implicit authority conferred by the preambular parts of both constitutions, national and provincial, to strengthen the justice system?or safeguard its",2,2007,Argentina
184,"administration, as well as from the aforementioned legal and constitutional authority which confers its management on the Higher Court of Justice. The judiciary has a non-repealable mission to guarantee the essential rights of individuals, sanctioning behaviours which harm those rights and ordering that any such unjust harm be redressed, it being essential to ensure the adequate and uninterrupted operation of its various organs in order to guarantee peaceful and healthy coexistence and the maintenance of citizens?rights.
.It is precisely because the right to strike is not an absolute right but a relative one, subject to the reasonable limits laid down in the corresponding regulations, as prescribed in articles  and  of the National Constitution, that it is open to regulation. Such regulation must flow not only from an act but also from the entity whose responsibility it is to provide the justice service. It was within this context that it was decided to establish a framework for (rather than prohibit) the exercise of direct action, while focusing less on the internal organization of the union or decisions taken by it. In short, whether we are looking at autonomous or delegated regulations, the provinces Higher Court of Justice, as head of the judicial authority, acted within the bounds of its competence when issuing the decision in question.
.The President of the Higher Court of Justice notes in this connection that under point  of the operative part of the decision in question, recourse to direct action must be preceded by an explanation from the union of the labour-related reasons for the conflict, together with any suggestions it may have in that regard, the aim of this being to find a rapid and effective means of resolving the complaints. The need for rapidity is obvious, in order not to hinder the normal functioning of the justice service and to foster the search for consensus solutions in the specific matter of conflicts.
.Where the decision by SITRAJ to take direct action liable to result in suspension, interruption or paralysis of any part of the service is concerned, point  of the operative part requires the establishment of rules regarding the means by and form in which this is to be communicated to the court, whereby the period of notice must be reasonable, namely five days before the stoppage or strike is due to begin. The reason for this is common knowledge; as the chief authority, the Higher Court of Justice must notify each of its offices in the capital and elsewhere in the province of the unions decision so that they can take the measures necessary to ensure an uninterrupted service. This period of notice is absolutely essential in order to avoid situations such as the calling of a stoppage just one day after the Higher Court of Justice is informed of that action. By way of illustration, it can be seen from file No. S-- that SITRAJ, on  June , informed the President of the Court that action would be taken as from  a.m. on  June , with the signing of timesheets and withdrawal from the workplace without allowing for continuity of the service to be duly safeguarded or for news of the action to be communicated to other courts and to members of the Public Prosecutors office.
.The union is also required to provide, together with its communication regarding the planned stoppage, a copy of the executive committees call to assembly, of the agreement and resolution and of the ad hoc book or list recording the attendance of members at the assembly in question, in addition to which point  stipulates that the minimum services to be maintained during the period of the conflict shall be established. In regard to such services, there are already decisions of the Court, formulated differently to the current one, which specified the manner in which these were to be organized. With respect to the requirement as to the submission of a copy of the executive committees call to assembly, of the agreement and resolution and of the ad hoc book or list recording the attendance of members at the extraordinary assembly convened solely for the purpose of discussing the taking of direct action, in no way does this imply interference in the union or its internal affairs.
.If the unions own statute, in sections (j),  and others, regulates the arrangements for giving notice of such a meeting, then requesting the union to provide a copy to the Court when it announces its decision and to specify the days on which the strike is to be held, responds, as the Higher Court of Justice states, to the basic principle of law whereby anyone calling for the adoption of a given situation must provide due grounds therefore. This requirement has everything to do with transparency and with the execution of the strike in due form and good faith, and can in no way be interpreted as undermining the rights of the appellant union or restricting the right to freedom of association. It is, moreover, a minimum requirement in the face of a decision to take strike action, which, as everyone knows, can be taken only as a final, extreme measure, whence the requirements laid down in the unions own statute for taking such a decision.
.In conclusion, none of the measures that have been ordered undermine, infringe or impair the right to strike or the right to freedom of association of the unions members, nor do they constitute an unfair practice or restrict the unions right to agree on direct action, which it can do subject to respect for the aforementioned conditions. Finally, the foreseen consequences also become irreproachable since the possibility of pursuing a declaration of lawfulness or unlawfulness is clearly unquestionable in regard to the exercise of the right to strike. Then, the whole question of remuneration for duties not performed, in addition to the reasons already set forth in the contested decision, is a principle that has repeatedly been supported by the Higher Court of Justice of the nation.
.The reasons which led the union to decide in favour of direct action are specified in the notifications received by the Higher Court of Justice. These refer specifically to: () salary adjustment:  per cent as at June ; and () disagreement: (a) with the sums being disbursed by the judiciary for the division of IT and buildings infrastructure; (b) regarding the advancement of lower-ranking employees; (c) regarding the Act on Independence; and (d)with the docking of salaries for days of work stoppage, among other things.
.The question of the budget/wage review and financial independence formed the main grounds for the demands made by the judicial employees, triggering the various strikes held in . It is essential that attention be drawn to the following in the interests of clarifying the matter, which is inextricably linked with the budget. The budget for the expenditure and resources of the judiciary for  was drawn up in accordance with strict prudential standards laid down by the General Budget Directorate of the province of Corrientes (files Nos --, -- and --), having regard to the financial cap imposed by the nation vis--vis the province, pursuant to the Act on Fiscal Responsibility, No. , and with due consideration at all times being shown for upcoming projects and tasks, such as the implementation of  new legal offices, staff strengthening in those offices experiencing a serious human resources deficit, continuation of the computerization plan and of the buildings and equipment infrastructure policy, all of these goals being closely and indissociably linked in the interests of achieving the Courts prime objective of ensuring the effective administration of justice, with priority being given to the improvement of working conditions for judicial employees.
.An initial presentation to the Provincial Executive of the budget for , in the amount of ,, Argentina pesos (ARS), provided for a salary increase of  per cent for judiciary employees. However, following application of the financial cap imposed by the nation on provincial budgets, the credits allocated for salary increases were reduced by per cent. The budget ultimately approved, by Act No. , was in the amount of ARS,,, the reductions made having been ARS,, under item  (staff costs), ARS,, under item  (consumer goods), and ARS,, under item (fixed assets). It is to be noted that the body in charge of the financial administration system has the constitutional authority to modify the amounts proposed by the Judiciary. Despite the decision by the Higher Court of Justice to ratify the initial amount of ARS,,, the provincial legislative power, pursuant to the Act on Fiscal Responsibility, No. , which requires that the national and provincial governments maintain a balanced budget, was obliged to reduce the amounts proposed.
.Also affected by the imposed reduction ?although to a lesser extent ?were capital investments. It was stated at the time that the decision signalled the intention to respect the state policy in regard to the judiciary and the provisions of the Act on Fiscal Responsibility. Within the",3,2007,Argentina
185,"described framework, the Higher Court of Justice granted a salary increase of  per cent by Decision No. /, with retroactive effect to  February , prior to the approval of and in response to the  budget, as authorized by the body in charge of the States financial administration system. Subsequently, Extraordinary Agreement No. / provided for a nominal increase of  per cent as from  August , representing an effective improvement of . per cent accumulated over the period in question, following approval of the Budget Act (), No. , and reorganization of the budgetary resources.
.It is to be noted that the judiciary shares in the provinces budget within the so-called central administration. SITRAJ demanded  per cent in order to be on a nominal footing with the increases granted by the executive to its employees, that is:  per cent under Decree No. / plus  per cent under Decree No. /, less the  per cent granted under Decision No. /. By way of illustration, it is to be recalled that from September  to the present, justice administration employees saw an increase in the actual purchasing power of their salaries in the order of  per cent, while over the same period the provincial executive merely confined itself to reviewing the slender basic incomes of the other employees of the central administration.
.The President of the Higher Court of Justice considers it necessary to point out that, under the constitution of the province of Corrientes, the budget for expenditure and resources of the judiciary is calculated by the executive on the basis of the preliminary draft drawn up by it and is approved by the legislature. Therefore, although the judiciary has full financial independence it does not have the constitutional powers to establish its budget. Thereafter, the economic and financial opportunities to grant salary increases depend solely on the financial resources legally available. Along the same lines, the fulfilment or otherwise of the rules established under Provincial Act No. , which sets a minimum of . per cent of the provinces general budget, is not the concern of the judicial authority but of the other authorities, and since the provinces general budget constitutes an act, it must be understood as modifying the former.
.As regards the use that is made of the budget, although the salary question is an essential one, it is at the same time but one aspect of the many requirements to be met. The administration of justice could not be effective without an adequate infrastructure, computer facilities or logistical organization to support the work of the courts. In this regard, the Judiciary currently (in ) allocates . per cent of its budget to staff costs, leaving only . per cent for goods and services and fixed assets.
.Where staff numbers are concerned, these have also increased. In , there were ,employees, including judges and judicial officials, that figure having risen to ,posts by . On the question of infrastructure, the judiciarys architecture unit set itself the objective to implement during  a number of premises projects necessitated by the creation and/or expansion of a number of judicial offices and their functions. Priority was given to the implementation of works designed to provide accommodation for the new functions, as well as to repair and maintenance work on the various premises in the capital and provinces, with objectives being proposed in line with available budgetary resources and the plan of works established at the beginning of the year. As regards the computerization programme, the IT Division, through its various units, has been a constant tool for implementation of the Higher Court of Justices decisions and institutional policies, as reflected in a series of measures: purchasing of the latest technology; updating of the corresponding regulations; ongoing user training; and strengthening of technical specialists.
.In the area of human resources, it is worth pointing out that work has been stepped up, through the judicial school, on the ongoing training, retraining and upgrading of judges, officials and employees. Work has been done on the functional structure of the courts, providing them with more staff and, above all, creating a balance between those having the same level of competence but different staffing levels. Access to all levels of the administration of justice was provided through open public competitions, with the application, perhaps for the first time in this province, of the constitutional provisions (article  of the Provincial Constitution) whereby employment in the public service shall be granted through the system of merit? The report also refers to investment in a vehicle fleet and to the creation of the Institute of Forensic Medicine (judicial morgue, criminal investigation laboratories, refrigeration equipment, etc.).
.Finally, the President of the Higher Court of Justice states that every effort has been made and continues to be made to ensure full protection of staff salaries in the various structures and at all the hierarchical levels, in the context of budgetary restrictions and of the economic situation currently being faced by the whole of Argentine society, with the relevant demands being addressed to other authorities within the framework of institutional dialogue, without this in any way implying the calling into question of this authoritys independence. Had the claim by SITRAJ been allowed and had this led to the award of a salary increase over and above the authorized budgetary items, that independence would have been placed in serious jeopardy, since it would then be a matter for the executive to decide whether or not to release the budgetary credits necessary to cover the resulting additional expenditure.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainants object to the decision by the Higher Court of Justice of the province of Corrientes to dock pay corresponding to two days of the work stoppage called by SITRAJ in June , and at least a further  days for stoppages in July, August and September , the stoppages having been called in protest against the absence of any response to the calls for salary increases and against the subsequent decision to render Decision No.  of  October , which regulates ?in a unilateral and arbitrary manner according to the complainants ?the right to strike within the sector (according to the complainants, the decision in question takes no account of the mandatory conciliation procedure, makes it obligatory to inform the judicial authority of the reasons for the conflict, which must be of a labour-related nature, imposes a five-day notice period ahead of the direct action, etc.). The complainants further allege that, with the aim of intimidating the SITRAJ leadership, criminal charges for the alleged crime of fraud were brought against its general secretary and subsequently dismissed, and that by Decision No.  of  March , the trade union privileges enjoyed by three SITRAJ leaders were withdrawn for the purpose of weakening the complainant organization.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that, in general terms, the Government states that officials working in the administration of justice are officials who exercise authority in the name of the State and whose right to strike could thus be subject to restrictions or even prohibition, but observes that in the present case the right to strike has at no time been prohibited or suspended but that minimum measures were taken to ensure that the judiciary could operate on an emergency basis under strike conditions. The Committee further notes the report of the Higher Court of Justice of the province of Corrientes, in which it is stated that: () the decisive circumstances resulting in the decision to establish a framework for the right to strike of judicial employees and harmonize the exercise of that right such as to ensure that the essential rights of individuals are not undermined stem from: (a) the exercise of that right during  days in , when employees of the judiciary joined stoppages ?abandoning their duties after signing the daily timesheets ?arranged by SITRAJ; and (b) the concern and call for conciliation on the part of the Supreme Council, comprising various law societies, in regard to the negative effects produced by the direct action taken by SITRAJ; () given the existence of regulations at the national level relating to cases of direct action in the context of activities that may be considered essential services (which was deemed to be inapplicable to labour conflicts arising on provincial territory), it was decided to adopt measures aimed at establishing a framework for the exercise of the right to strike; () the competence of the Supreme Court of Justice to act by adopting the disputed measure has constitutional and legal backing; ()the justice service constitutes a function in its own right that is essential and cannot be delegated and whose implementation and efficient provision fall chiefly to the Higher Court of Justice, which is the reason why internal measures were adopted in order to adapt the constitutional exercise of the right to strike; () the judiciary has a non-repealable mission to guarantee the essential rights of individuals,",-1,2007,Argentina
186,"sanctioning behaviours which harm those rights and ordering that any such unjust harm be redressed, it being essential to ensure the adequate and uninterrupted operation of its various organs in order to guarantee peaceful and healthy coexistence and the maintenance of citizens?rights; ()in this context it was decided to establish a framework for, and not to prohibit, the exercise of direct action; and () the reasons which led SITRAJ to decide in favour of direct action had to do with the salary adjustment and with disagreement as to the allocation of funds for the division of IT and buildings infrastructure, the advancement of lower-ranking employees, the Act on Independence and the docking of salaries for days of work stoppage. According to the report by the President of the Higher Court of Justice, every effort has been made and continues to be made to ensure full protection of staff salaries in the various structures and at all the hierarchical levels, in the context of budgetary restrictions and of the economic situation currently being faced by Argentine society.
.Regarding the disputed decision by the Higher Court of Justice of the province of Corrientes to dock pay corresponding to two days of the work stoppage called by SITRAJ in June , and at least a further days for stoppages in July, August and September , the stoppages having been called in protest against the absence of any response to the calls for salary increases, the Committee recalls that is has pointed out on various occasions that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, fifth edition, , para. ]. This being the case, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.Regarding the disputed Decision No.  of  October  ?adopted, according to the complainants, in a unilateral and arbitrary manner ?which regulates the right to strike in the judicial sector in the province of Corrientes, the Committee, while recalling, as it has done on previous occasions in respect of other cases relating to Argentina, that officials working in the administration of justice and the judiciary are officials who exercise authority in the name of the State and whose right to strike could thus be subject to restrictions, such as its suspension or even prohibition [see th Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. ; and st Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. ] observes that judicial workers enjoy the right to strike.
.Regarding the allegation as to the unilateral nature of Decision No.  issued by the Higher Court of Justice of the province of Corrientes, which regulates the right to strike within the sector, the Committee observes that neither the Government nor the provinces supreme judicial authority have denied this allegation. In this respect, the Committee recalls the importance it attaches to the promotion of dialogue and consultations on matters of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative occupational organizations of the sector involved [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee expects that in future the authorities will endeavour to ensure compliance with this principle and to promote collective bargaining, including on wages.
.The Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the allegations, presented in , that: () with the aim of intimidating the SITRAJ leadership, criminal charges for the alleged crime of fraud were brought against its general secretary and subsequently dismissed and requests it to institute an investigation to determine whether these charges had an anti-union intimidation or discrimination motive; and () by Decision No.  of  March  the trade union privileges enjoyed by three SITRAJ leaders were withdrawn for the purpose of weakening the complainant organization.
.Finally, in respect of the declaration of illegality in relation to the strike, that according to the complainant organization lies within the power of the Minister of Labour, Employment and Social Security, the Committee recalls that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the Government but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expects that in future the authorities will endeavour to ensure compliance with the principle of the importance of dialogue and consultations on matters of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative occupational organizations of the sector involved and to promote collective bargaining, including on wages.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the allegations, presented in , that with the aim of intimidating the SITRAJ leadership, criminal charges for the alleged crime of fraud were brought against its general secretary and subsequently dismissed and requests it to establish an investigation to determine whether these charges had an anti-union intimidation or discrimination motive. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations relating to the allegations that by Decision No.  of  March , the trade union privileges enjoyed by three SITRAJ leaders were withdrawn for the purpose of weakening the complainant organization.",-1,2007,Argentina
187,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the ATE dated October . The ATE presented further allegations in a communication dated May . The Government submitted its observations in a communication dated October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of October , the Association of State Workers (ATE) presented a complaint against the Government of Argentina concerning the violation of ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and  as a result of the violation of the right of collective bargaining for national civil servants. The ATE states that it is a first-level trade union with official trade union status (No. ), operates throughout the territory of Argentina, and is affiliated to the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA), a third-level trade union organization registered under No. .. The ATE sets out the constitutional and legal provisions that guarantee trade unions the right to collective bargaining and freedom of association as a fundamental right. The ATE alleges that, despite this formal protection of the right to collective bargaining, the Government, during collective wage talks with civil servants, practised discrimination, and obstructed and ultimately abandoned collective bargaining, in flagrant violation of ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and .
.Specifically, the ATE states that, in the context of open collective bargaining between the Government, as employer, and the National Civil Servants?Union (UPCN) and the ATE, representing employees, a collective labour agreement for the national civil service was signed on  December  and later approved by Decree No. /, which contains provisions relating to the negotiation of sectoral collective agreements within the overall framework of the general collective agreement.
.With regard to collective wage bargaining, the collective labour agreement (Decree No./) provides that: The staff members remuneration shall comprise a base amount, an amount reflecting his or her grade or equivalent, plus any additional payments, supplements, bonuses and incentive payments that correspond to his or her category, in accordance with the regulations laid down in the sectoral agreements ...?(section ). In other words, pay is subject to sectoral bargaining on the basis of the wage standards and structure outlined in the general collective labour agreement. Furthermore, in order to ensure that pay levels can still be negotiated to reflect current inflation and the consequent decline in real wages, the agreement allows for a six-monthly review, so that amendments can be made to the text of the agreement without terminating it (section(e)).
.Therefore, although the general collective agreement was signed in December , the parties called for a pay review in May  and May . In this regard, the ATE has always argued that the starting point of any such review must be the minimum wage provided for in the Constitution and defined in section  of the Employment Contracts Act (Act No. ), that is, the amount needed to ensure that all workers and their families have access to adequate food, decent housing, education, clothing, health care, recreation, transportation, holidays and social security. In other words, the starting point for any wage negotiations must be the minimum amount provided for by law and by the Constitution, which was estimated in December  at , pesos, as had been stated by the CTA in the National Wage Council.
.According to the ATE, the first stage in a wage negotiation process should be joint meetings aimed at reaching a negotiated agreement on the wage review. However, on April , the Government, represented by the President of Argentina, and the UPCN, as a representative union, held an official press conference at Government House announcing a  per cent wage increase for civil servants, to be implemented in the form of a  per cent increase with effect from June  and a  per cent increase with effect from August the same year. In other words, without engaging in a bargaining process and without consulting the ATE, which is a signatory to the general collective agreement and a member of the general negotiating committee, the Government, having consulted only one of the parties (the UPCN), announced a wage increase.
.According to the ATE, it is clear that this wage increase was imposed because on April , two days after the  per cent increase was announced in the press, it was invited to attend a meeting at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, where it was expected to sign a document outlining the wage increase and thereby endorse the wage deal that had been imposed. At the meeting, after the ATE stated its objections to and rejection of the Governments position, the Ministry of Labour refused to allow the ATEs position to be reflected in the record of the meeting, which had to be set out in a separate document. It is clear that there was no collective wage bargaining for  in the national public sector, and that this  per cent wage increase for civil servants was quite simply imposed by the Government.
.The ATE, reiterating that collective bargaining must be free and that the starting point for negotiations should be the minimum wage established by law and by the Constitution, adds that with the onset of  and the need to carry out a wage review for that year, the ATE and the civil servants were once again denied their right to negotiate freely. Adopting the same approach as in , the President of Argentina and the Secretary-General of the UPCN, among other unions, on  April  announced a . per cent wage increase for civil servants, to be implemented in the form of a  per cent increase effective as from June  and a further . per cent increase effective as from August. Once again, without any form of bargaining and without the signatories to the general collective agreement being invited to negotiate a fair wage increase for civil servants, the . per cent increase was imposed following its announcement in the media on  April , as the attached documentation makes clear.
.In this regard, a week after that announcement was made, on  May , the parties were called to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security to sign a document accepting the increase which had been announced a few days earlier. The ATE reiterated its rejection of the procedure adopted by the Government but, as at the  meeting, was denied the opportunity to place its views on record and had to set out its position in a separate document.
.According to the ATE, the position adopted by the Government constitutes a systematic violation of freedom of association and collective bargaining. First, there has been a denial of the right to free collective bargaining. Second, there has been an absence of formal collective bargaining, an agreement being reached informally with only one of the unions concerned, which violates the principle of bargaining in good faith and discriminates against one of the representative unions. Third, there has been no sectoral collective bargaining, which means that sectors have been unable to discuss and negotiate the most favourable wage conditions.
.As has been noted, the practice systematically adopted by the Government of Argentina in these two sets of pay negotiations for civil servants has been as follows: (a) to announce the wage increase for civil servants in the media; (b) to call a meeting of the general negotiating committee to rubber stamp?the announced increase; and (c) to call on meetings of the sectoral negotiating committees to implement the increase. No in-depth analysis is required to conclude that there is de facto an absence of collective wage bargaining in the public sector.
.There is indeed a de facto denial of the right to collective wage bargaining, and hence there is no suitable negotiation forum in which the parties could express their views on the wage increase for the year in question. Instead, wage increases previously announced in the media have been imposed arbitrarily and without justification, in violation of the employees?right to negotiate. This is how the Government has fixed the wage ceilings for  and , without giving civil servants the opportunity to discuss collectively the wage policies that affect them.
.The ATE considers this to be quite simply a refusal to allow collective wage bargaining for civil servants, as well as being a violation of the duty to negotiate in good faith. The ATE believes that, as the ILO has stated, the principle of bargaining in good faith involves recognizing representative organizations, making every effort to reach an agreement, engaging in genuine and constructive negotiations, avoiding unjustified delays in the negotiations, and respecting commitments undertaken, taking into account the results of negotiations made in good faith. The Government, as the employer, decided to exclude the ATE from the agreements, which constitutes discriminatory treatment. Indeed, the employer, rather than holding negotiations in accordance with",0,2007,Argentina
188,"the principle of representation that it itself acknowledged in the general negotiating committee for the general collective agreement No. /, bypassed the ATE and chose instead to deal with another union. Although the collective agreement provides that both the ATE and UPCN should be involved in the negotiation of any wage agreements for the national civil service, the wage increases were announced with the consent of only one of the parties. In this regard, the Government, as the employer, circumvented the general negotiating committee by agreeing on an inadequate wage increase with another trade union without consulting the ATE or the workers, which constitutes discrimination.
.The ATE indicates that, following the media announcements and a meeting of the general negotiating committee at which the announced increase was imposed without the ATE having any opportunity to negotiate or even to place its views on record, the Government convened sectoral negotiating committees with a view to concluding similar agreements and pursuing its economic policy. The meetings of the sectoral negotiating committees were all held at the same time, on  May  and  May , and at no time was the ATE given the opportunity to express its views. Collective bargaining in the civil service sectors has been blocked as a result of the imposition of a wage by the general negotiating committee which held no discussion or debate, something which constitutes a violation of the internationally recognized right to collective bargaining.
.The ATE adds that attention should also be given to the action of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which, far from acting as an impartial body, endorsed the irregular actions of the employer (the Government). According to the ATE, the implementing authority complied with the Governments instructions, in other words, it did not convene joint wage negotiations until after the increase had been announced in the media and did not allow the ATE to put on record its views and its rejection of the agreement, thereby preventing free collective bargaining. The ATE considers that this situation is a result of the approach taken by the employer in making its offers, setting dates, issuing threats and carrying out specific functions that belong to the capacity of the impartial body?responsible for facilitating talks. The Minister of Labour is, administratively speaking, an employee of the central Government and as such is bound to respect the hierarchical principle that prevails in administrative law. This in itself shows that it is inadequate to negotiate with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which in such matters is both judge and jury.
.The Ministry of Labour is not an independent body, as its actions have shown. There is clearly no spirit of negotiation and the Ministry has failed to provide an opportunity to negotiate freely. The ATE considers the complicity of the Ministry of Labour in that it had a role to play in the Governments bad faith, by forcing a workers?organization to accept imposed conditions without any further opportunity for discussion.
.In its communication of May , the ATE alleges that on  April , the Government, represented by the President of Argentina, and the UPCN, as a representative union, held an official press conference at Government House announcing a . per cent pay increase for civil servants, to be implemented in the form of a  per cent increase with effect from June , and a . per cent increase with effect from August. On that occasion, the increase was not only announced but approved in the record of a meeting to which the ATE was not even invited. In other words, once again, without engaging in a bargaining process and without consulting the ATE, which is a signatory to the general collective agreement and a member of the general negotiating committee, the Government, in consultation with only one of the parties (the UPCN), announced a wage increase for the national civil service.
.According to the ATE, this compounds the discriminatory attitude demonstrated by the implementation of wage increases for national civil servants in  and , and reflects a deteriorating situation in terms of violation of collective bargaining, discrimination and the imposition of a wage increase, in so far as an official document was signed at Government House without consulting the ATE and without any negotiation.
.The ATE emphasizes that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, far from acting as an impartial body, endorsed the irregular actions of the Government employer in the approach it has taken in recent years. Lastly, the complainant organization points out that, on  May , the ATE was called upon to endorse the increase which had already been agreed with another trade union one week earlier, and was again denied the opportunity to place on record its rejection of the increase and had to do so in a separate document.
.In its communication of  October , the Government indicated that workers in the public administration had opted for trade union pluralism, which means the coexistence of different representative bodies with official trade union status. The ATE, established in , with official trade union status (No. ), and the UPCN, established in  with official trade union status (No. ), are first-level trade union organizations to which all public sector workers at national, provincial, municipal and territorial levels, and throughout the whole of Argentina, are affiliated.
.Trade union pluralism in the public sector was formalized in resolution No.  of October  adopted by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which adopted the principle of trade union pluralism regarding representativeness on the basis of the provisions contained in sections  and  of Act No.  relating to collective bargaining and in the light of the historical context of worker representation, thus allowing a trade union to be granted official trade union status even if an existing union with official trade union status already operates in the same area, activity or category. Both organizations have exercised their rights to collective bargaining which are derived from their status as official trade unions.
.The Government notes that the level of representativeness was determined using the criteria laid down in Convention No. , a fact never disputed by the complainant organization. It should therefore be understood that both entities had established their representative status in an objective manner, as required by the ILO, and had at all times respected the principle of freedom of association. Moreover, in certain sectors or national bodies, as well as provincial or municipal public sector bodies, different trade unions can perform similar functions, so that there are sometimes more than two unions with official trade union status. In view of this fact, the collective bargaining system in the national public sector envisages a general or framework agreement incorporating sectoral agreements, the negotiating committees including representatives of sectoral unions as well as national trade unions with official trade union status.
.This means that the general collective agreement is signed by the ATE and UPCN on the trade union side, but collective bargaining for each sectoral collective agreement (under the terms of the general agreement) involves the organizations with official trade union status that are active in that field. The signatories of the Collective Bargaining Convention No./ are the State, the UPCN and the ATE. The collective agreement in question was concluded following difficult talks between the workers and the employer which were then reflected in the various documents contained in files / and /. Discussions between the parties were free and open. In addition, collective bargaining in the national public administration is guided above all by the provisions of Convention No..
.The Government denies that it is the task of the negotiating committee merely to approve official announcements. In fact, Argentine legislation envisages, as the first step to initiating sectoral collective bargaining, the establishment of the bargaining committee by which authorized representatives are appointed to participate in collective talks. It should be noted that legislation does not stipulate the number of representatives, which means that the number of members is determined by the parties involved (section  of Act ). The Government points out that the ILO has not objected to bodies of this kind provided that, whatever the system adopted, its main objective is to foster, by all possible means, free and voluntary collective bargaining involving all parties. The negotiating committee was set up precisely with the aim of facilitating collective bargaining between the social partners in a free and voluntary manner.
.The Government states that, as further proof of total collective independence and trade union pluralism in the public sector, section  of Act No.  stipulates that ?the representation of public employees will be undertaken by trade union associations, unions or federations with official trade union status and a national mandate, in accordance with section  ? However, in relation to the most representative trade union bodies, it stipulates that if ?.. there is a lack of consensus between the trade unions with collective bargaining rights in relation to the collective bargaining committee, the Ministry of",-1,2007,Argentina
189,"Labour and Social Security shall determine, in accordance with the relevant regulations, the percentage of votes that corresponds to each party. To this end, it shall take into account the number of paid-up members belonging to each association in the corresponding sector? For their part, the legislative regulations clearly state that if more than one trade union association with official trade union status and national remit is represented on the collective bargaining committee for the general collective agreement, the number of votes corresponding to each of these associations shall be proportional to the number of paid-up union members in the public sector?
.The Government adds that in this case, the representativeness of the two organizations was compared on the basis of the lists of paid-up members provided by the organizations themselves. The UPCN was shown to be the more representative union. The data were obtained in an objective manner, as required by the ILO, and the matter of representativeness has not been contested.
.The Government states that, in the light of the above and after the formal opening of negotiations, numerous meetings were held and all were chaired by the appointed official. The Government categorically denies that the ATE did not participate in subsequent meetings. The trade union organization in question had the right to be heard and to state its position under article  of the national Constitution, as the records of subsequent meetings show. The truth is that the ATE is less representative than the UPCN and has filed this complaint under false pretences. The collective agreement for public sector employees was concluded within the framework of, with respect for and in compliance with, the relevant legislation. The process complied with both national labour law and the ILOs recommendations.
.The Government also states that it is aware of and abides by its obligation to comply with Conventions Nos , ,  and , and that the legislation in force supports and defends the collective independence of the social partners participating in collective bargaining. Furthermore, Act No. , which governs the system of employment in the public sector, provides that, through an agreement between the parties, the legislative provisions may be adapted to the sectors of the public administration which present specific characteristics in terms of collective bargaining, as laid down in Act No. . That is to say, the complainant organization is signatory to sectoral agreements in the negotiation and approval of which it was fully involved. According to the Government, the complainants allegations are unfounded, as it participated at all stages of the collective bargaining process and was able to express its own position. This procedure has never been challenged, either in relation to the issue of representativeness or the building of consensus. At any event, the complainant failed to win support for its own position during negotiations under the normal conditions of freedom and independence enjoyed by the various representative unions in the sectors.
.The ATE always declared its position at the start of collective negotiations. The Government denies that there was any de facto denial of collective bargaining, or that there was any attempt to circumvent discussions. It therefore considers that the allegation of a de facto denial of collective bargaining must be rejected.
.The Government adds that the complainant organization filed its complaint following the announcement of a  per cent wage increase for civil servants, to be implemented in the form of a  per cent increase effective as of June  and a  per cent increase effective as of August the same year. The announcement was made on  April  by the highest official authorities and members of the trade union organization which had signed the agreement. The Government states that the ATE was invited to all the meetings of the bargaining committee, as the record of the meeting of  April  shows. The Government, as the employer, and the UPCN and ATE, all signatories to collective agreement No. /, were present at the Labour Ministry. The Government, as the employer, made an offer to these two official trade union organizations. The UPCN accepted the offer, while the ATE of its own free will rejected it.
.However, internal matters concerning trade union representation and the reasons given by one or other organization for differences between their negotiating strategies are not the Governments concern. What has been acknowledged by the Government is the fact that an organization representing a majority accepted the offer. According to the Government, the complainant organization is trying to involve the Government in an internal union matter by filing an international complaint. The Government informed the complainant organization that an agreement had been approved by the majority, which meant that it complied with the law, as section  of Act No.  states that: Representation of public sector employees shall be carried out by trade union associations, unions or federations with official trade union status and national remit, under the terms of section . If there is no consensus between trade unions with collective bargaining rights regarding the membership of the negotiating committee, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security shall define, in accordance with the regulations, the percentage of votes appropriate to each party. To this end, it shall take into account the number of paid-up members belonging to each association in the relevant sector.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Government states that it was necessary, from a legal point of view, to finalize the records of meetings and have them approved by the majority in order to avoid confusing the employers when it came to applying them. This was the reason for requesting that the minority organization (the complainant) place its opinions on record in a separate document. As a result, section  of Act No.  was invoked in response to the complainants challenge but there was never any final closure and no discriminatory attitude.
.The Government states that the ATE participated in every joint meeting called by the Ministry of Labour. As the records state, Mr Eduardo De Gennaro, Mr Leopoldo Gonzlez, Dr Matas Cremonte and other representatives of the ATE took part in the joint meetings. The trade union representatives were not coerced into signing the agreement, and the result was wholly the product of direct negotiations between the parties. The right to collective bargaining and freedom of expression was thus respected, as the complainant organization always expressed its opinion, and the allegation concerning a lack of freedom of association is unfounded, as the Ministry of Labour never interfered in the activities and internal affairs of the ATE. The ATE was never excluded from meetings falling under the remit of the respective negotiating committee, and the minutes of those meetings, which mention the trade union organization in question, are evidence of this.
.According to the Government, the statements concerning the wage increases in  are not true. With regard to the complainants statement that the starting point for any wage negotiations must be the minimum amount provided for by law and by the Constitution, which was estimated in December  at , pesos? the Government states that, under section  of Act No. , the National Council for Employment, Productivity and the Minimum Adjustable Wage is a tripartite body presided over by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. The Councils rules of procedure are laid down in Decree No. / and section  of Decree No. /. Section  stipulates that, once the debate has ended, the president must propose a vote or votes on the matter at hand. Voting cannot be repeated on the same issue during the same session, except when it is authorized by more than  per cent of the council members present. All council resolutions must be approved by two-thirds of the  council members.
.The Government states that on  July  the Council was convened and, following tripartite negotiations, the minimum salary was then set, with effect from  August , at  pesos for workers on monthly contracts who work with the statutory working hours stipulated in section  of Act No. , except under the specific circumstances stipulated in section  of that law, which established an appropriate proportion of salary payable, and . pesos per hour for workers on daily contracts. From  October , the respective amounts increased to  pesos for workers on monthly contracts and .pesos per hour for workers on daily contracts. From  December , the rates were pesos for monthly workers and . pesos per hour for daily workers. In line with resolution  of  July , the minimum wage was fixed from  August  at ,pesos for monthly workers and . pesos per hour for workers on daily contracts, and from  December  the monthly and daily rates were at , pesos and . pesos per hour respectively.
.The Government points out that the primary criterion used to establish the minimum wage is that of reasonableness? That is what is laid down in section , according to which pay is established by the",4,2007,Argentina
190,"Council taking into account the data regarding the socioeconomic situation, the objectives of the institution, and extent to which the two can be reasonably matched? Section  has to be interpreted in the light of section  of ActNo. , which stipulates that workers are guaranteed a minimum wage which will allow them to address their basic needs in terms of food, accommodation and leisure. The Government believes that the ATEs statement that the starting point for wage negotiations must be , pesos from December , does not comply with the legislation. The pay increase must also meet the criterion of reasonableness. By contrast, the ATEs statement is a dogmatic assertion and is not accompanied by any documentary evidence to support its claims or the amount stated as a minimum. According to the Government, when the complainant organization states, regarding the sectoral wage negotiations, that the Government convened sectoral negotiating committees with a view to concluding similar agreements? this constitutes bad faith, as it abandons the principle of reasonableness which is the product of tripartite dialogue.
.The Government rejects the claim that an agreement was imposed during sectoral collective bargaining in the public administration. In May , the complainant organization itself requested that the collective bargaining process continue, and the Government consented in accordance with the principles of freedom of association. The ATE requested that sectoral negotiations begin in order to guarantee the right to collective bargaining for all the workers involved, and negotiations are now under way with the Ministry. Although this process was not immediately implemented in all sectors, given the scope of the negotiations, it does address operational issues. As a result, the ATE actively participated in concluding a number of specific sectoral agreements, including the following: National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA), Decree No. / of June; Seafarers Decree No. / of  June ; National Parks Administration (Guarda parques) Decree No. / of June , Receiver General of Argentina (SIGEN) Decree No. / of  June , National Institute of Industrial Technology (INTI) Decree / of  June , National Commission for Space Activities Decree No./ of  June , National Administrative Profession System (SINAPA) Decree No. / of  May ; Orchestras, Choirs and Ballet of the National Ministry of Culture, Decree No. / of June , National Service for Agrifood Sanitary Inspection and Quality (SENASA), Decree No. / of June ; Professionals in Hospitals and Nursing Centres and Research and Production Institutes of the Ministry of Health, Decree No. / of  June ; National Institute of Agricultural and Livestock Technology (INTA) Decree  of  June ; Civilian Staff and Management in the Armed Security Forces (UPECIFA) Decree No. / of July ; the  APEN grades, Decree No. / of  June . It should be made clear that the Labour Ministry resolution /, which approved the abovementioned agreements in section , reads as follows: inform the Permanent Bicameral Commission of the Honourable National Congress? and also enables the legislature to take action in the event of any irregularities.
.According to the Government, it is difficult to understand the attitude of the complainant organization and its reasons for filing a complaint, and the Government categorically denies the ATEs allegations regarding the violation of freedom of association, as it used its right to vote and expressed its opinion in all joint meetings that took place. In addition to making its position clear on the matter of wage increases raised during the debate, its rejection of the proposal was recorded in the minutes drafted at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security.
.Finally, the Government states that: () collective bargaining is promoted in the public sector by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which convenes the signatory organizations, in this case the UPCN and the ATE, with a view to establishing a negotiating committee for the purpose of initiating sectoral collective bargaining; ()the Government recognizes the ATE as a party authorized to sign collective agreements, with the right to be heard, the right to a reasoned decision and the right to put forward proposals, which, in the case of the wage increases, did not meet the criterion of reasonableness? () trade union representation is allowed in the public sector in accordance with the principles of freedom of association; () if, during the discussions, the complainant organization was unable to impose its view, then this is a matter to be resolved with the other trade union body and every effort should be made to find a common position; () the minimum wage is established by means of a tripartite system involving all sectors, whereby each party is able to exercise its rights and the majority view takes precedence; and () the criticism regarding the lack of an impartial body is not pertinent to the complaint, which concerns decisions made by bodies which have led to a bipartite or tripartite agreement which fails to satisfy a minority; nothing has occurred here that would justify the intervention of an impartial body.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that despite being a signatory, together with the UPCN, to the collective labour agreement for the national civil service, which provides that collective wage bargaining is subject to sectoral bargaining, no such negotiations have taken place. In addition, the ATE alleges that representatives of the Government and the UPCN held meetings and jointly announced wage increases (apparently for all public service employees) for the years ,  and , without the participation of the ATE.
.In this regard, the Committee notes the Governments statements to the effect that: () in the public administration, workers opted for trade union pluralism, that is, the coexistence of different trade union bodies with official trade union status (the ATE and UPCN); ()regarding the issue of wage increases, the ATE was invited to attend all the meetings of the joint negotiating committee, as is clear from the record of the meeting held on  April ; () the meeting in question was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Labour, UPCN and ATE, and the representatives of the Government made an offer which was accepted by the UPCN ?the most representative organization ?but rejected by the ATE; () during the meetings the trade union representatives were not coerced into signing the agreement and the outcome was entirely the product of direct negotiations between the parties; () the ATE was never excluded from the meetings, and the claim that any agreement was imposed during the negotiations is not true; and () in May , the ATE requested that collective negotiations begin and the Ministry of Labour has consented. Although the process may not have been immediately implemented in all sectors, given the scope of the negotiations, it does address operational issues (the Government mentions more than ten collective agreements that were concluded in  with the participation of the ATE).
.Under the circumstances, given the clarifications provided by the Government, and having observed that, in any event, sectoral collective bargaining is indeed taking place in the public administration with the participation of the ATE, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,2007,Argentina
191,".The Committee last examined this case, in connection with the dismissal of the leader of the Association of Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration of Salta (ATAP), Ms Marina del Valle Guanca, and the transfer of three other ATAP leaders, at its November  meeting. On that occasion, it was still awaiting the additional information which the Government had indicated that it intended to obtain concerning the alleged anti union transfers of three ATAP leaders. The Committee also requested the Government to send without delay its observations concerning the ATAPs allegations relating to obstacles and delays in the handling of a penal complaint against the authorities of the provinces Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare concerning the check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues [see th Report, paras ?].
.In communications dated  January and  March , the ATAP states that it has filed a penal complaint in this case and requested that the Governor of Salta province, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the Secretary-General for Governance, and the judges of the Salta Court of Justice be prosecuted for anti-trade union discrimination, failure to comply with international treaties, and abuse of authority and violation of the duties of public servants.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government forwarded a report, transmitted by the General Directorate for Revenues, in which it is stated that: () the decision ordering the reinstatement of the union leader, Ms Marina del Valle Guanca, was overturned by the Salta Court of Justice and Ms del Valle Guanca filed an extraordinary appeal before the Salta Supreme Court; that appeal is currently pending before the provincial Court of Justice, which will determine whether it will be allowed; () the alleged transfers of three trade union leaders are in fact not transfers but simply internal rotations within the agency (General Directorate for Revenues), with no change to either the employment status or the salaries of the agents concerned; and () the General Directorate for Revenues has no jurisdiction over the matter of union dues.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee requests the Government: () to keep it informed of the progress made in the proceedings relating to the extraordinary appeal filed by the ATAP in connection with the dismissal of the union leader, Ms Marina del Valle Guanca; () to send its observations without delay on the ATAPs allegations concerning the obstacles and delays in the handling of the penal complaint against the provincial authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in connection with the check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues; and () to keep it informed of the progress made with regard to the criminal complaint filed by the ATAP against the Governor of Salta province, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the Secretary General for Governance, and the judges of the Salta Court of Justice on the grounds of anti-trade union discrimination, failure to comply with international treaties, and abuse of authority and violation of the duties of public servants.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting, and on that occasion requested the Government to take the necessary steps without delay to initiate an inquiry into the alleged transfer from their workplace of three leaders of the Association of Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration of Salta (ATAP) who were permanent staff members of the General Tax Directorate of the province of Salta: namely, Sergio Martn Zamboni, finance secretary; Ftima Elisabeth Gramajo, third substitute member; and Walter Rodolfo Alderete, second regular member of the electoral board; and, should it be found that the three were transferred on anti-union grounds, to take steps to ensure their reinstatement in their former posts. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed in that regard. The Committee further noted that the ATAP alleged that there had been obstacles and delays in the handling of a penal complaint against the authorities of the provinces Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare concerning the checkoff code for the deduction of trade union dues, and requested the Government to send its observations on the matter [see th Report, paras ?].
.In a communication of March , the Government states that the General Tax Directorate of the province informed it that Sergio Martn Zamboni is employed in the financial administration service of the treasury unit; Ftima Elisabeth Gramajo was appointed in  by Decree No. / as coordinator of the Undersecretariat for Native Peoples under the Ministry of Human Development; this appointment was revoked by Decree No. / and she returned to the General Tax Directorate; and Walter Rodolfo Alderete is employed in the financial administration service pursuant to Decree No. / and is currently working in the tax audit subprogramme under Rotation Memorandum No./. The Government points out that this information does not indicate that the persons concerned were transferred on anti-union grounds, but shows that since they entered the service they have been employed in the same public administration ?the General Tax Directorate ?which is still the case. The Government adds that, notwithstanding this information, further information will be requested from the provincial administration concerning the complaint presented.
.The Committee takes note of this information and looks forward to receiving the additional information which the Government indicates that it intends to obtain concerning the alleged anti-union transfers of three ATAP leaders. The Committee also requests the Government to send without delay its observations concerning the ATAPs allegations relating to obstacles and delays in the handling of a penal complaint against the authorities of the provinces Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare concerning the checkoff code for the deduction of trade union dues.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting, when it made the following recommendations [see st Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee expects that the decree on reinstatement without loss of pay of the trade union leader of the Association of Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration of Salta (ATAP), Ms Marina del Valle Guanca, will be adopted without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) As to the alleged transfer from their workplace of three ATAP leaders who were permanent members of staff at the General Tax Directorate of the Province, Sergio Martn Zamboni, finance secretary, Ftima Elizabeth Gramajo, third substitute member, and Walter Rodolfo Alderete, second regular member of the electoral board, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that an investigation is carried out into the matter without delay and, should it be found that the three were transferred on anti-union grounds, to take steps to ensure their immediate reinstatement in their former posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take steps in order to facilitate an agreement between ATAP and the relevant authorities of the province of Salta on the deduction of trade union dues from members?wages. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In communications dated  and  April , the complainant organization states that: ()an appeal was lodged by the executive authority of the province of Salta against the reinstatement of trade union leader Marina del Valle Guanca and that the Court of Justice of Salta upheld the appeal and reversed the decision of the court of first instance; and ()no steps have been taken to carry out the investigation into the alleged anti-union transfers requested by the Committee. ATAP further alleges that there have been obstacles and delays in the handling of a penal complaint against the authorities of the provinces Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare concerning the check-off code for the deduction of trade union dues.
.The Committee takes note of the information supplied by the complainant organization and requests the Government to send its observations on the matter, to take the necessary steps without delay to initiate an inquiry into the alleged transfer from their workplace of three ATAP leaders who were permanent staff members of the General Tax Directorate of the province of Salta, namely, Sergio Martn Zamboni, finance secretary, Ftima Elizabeth Gramajo, third substitute member, and Walter Rodolfo Alderete, second regular member of the electoral board, and, should it be found that the three were transferred on anti-union grounds, to take steps to ensure their immediate reinstatement in their former posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the Association of Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration of Salta (ATAP) dated  March . ATAP sent additional information in a communication dated  November  and further allegations in a communication dated  April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  March and  November ,",-1,2007,Argentina
192,"and  April , ATAP states that it obtained legal personality and/or trade union registration on  July  through resolution No. / of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security of the Republic of Argentina. During the electoral process organized on  January , in the light of the broad terms of section  of Act No.  and section  of Regulatory Decree No. /, the electoral board of the association informed the executive of the Province of Salta that a Celeste-Rojo?list was to be submitted in the electoral and voting process that ATAP would be holding on  January  to comply with the rules.
.With that process completed, on  February  the trade union, through the Territorial Agency of Salta, informed the competent body, the Trade Union Directorate of the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security in due time and in accordance with procedure that it had completed its electoral process as the rules required, and enclosed supporting documentation. On  February , it formally notified in detail to the executive (the Governor of the Province of Salta) the composition of its new management committee and audit committee, whose legal mandate was to run from January  to  January .
.On  February , ATAP informed, among other bodies of the provincial public administration, the Secretariat for Medical Assistance and Social Welfare which reports directly to the Governor of the Province, that Ms Marina del Valle Guanca had been appointed to the post of second substitute member of ATAPs audit committee. ATAP recounts that, after about two years working as an intern in which she engaged in moonlighting, on  March , through Decree No. /, she was appointed by the executive of the Province of Salta to an administrative post? On  June , she was made Head of the Operational Procurement Unit of the Financial Administrative Service?of the abovementioned Secretariat. On  January , through Decree No. /, the executive of the Province appointed her as from  December , to a Group T, subgroup , level , rank IV function, which is specific to posts involving the management, supervision or assessment of staff and/or tasks?
.In February , Ms Marina del Valle Guanca was notified, while taking her annual leave entitlement, that she was to be relocated?from the Secretariat for Medical Assistance and Social Welfare to the Administrative Secretariat Division of the Directorate of Archives of the Province, where she would take up a technical post?
.The complainant states that, on  February , Ms Marina del Valle Guanca sought a review of that decision. On  March , having received no reply and the time limits prescribed in section  of Act No.  on Administrative Procedures having expired, she formally requested the executive to issue a prompt ruling on the matter. To date she has received no reply.
.ATAP alleges that, regardless of whether the post is a technical or an administrative one, the so-called relocation?of Ms Marina del Valle Guanca, constitutes a substantial and unlawful change in working conditions and a flagrant violation of freedom of association by the executive of the Province of Salta, which was prompted by her trade union activity and not the needs of the service, the apparent justification in Decree No. /.
.In fact, the transfer, or relocation? is linked to her membership of the audit committee of ATAPs management committee.
.The complainant organization considers that, since there was no prior judicial order to remove the trade union immunity of trade union leader Ms Marina del Valle Guanca, Decree No. / is unlawful, being seriously flawed because it violates the guarantees established in favour of trade union leaders under ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and, which have all been ratified by Argentina and which are currently in force in the country.
.In its communication of  November , ATAP alleges that on  April  the executive of the Province of Salta notified Ms Marina del Valle Guanca of Decree No. of  April  dismissing her. ATAP states that she was denied access to the case file, that she lodged an application for clarification and that on  June  she was informed that her application for review had been rejected.
.According to ATAP, her denunciation of acts of corruption, which are notorious, was another reason for Ms Marina del Valle Guancas termination, this being the more serious as at the time she was receiving medical treatment, and indeed still is. For her transfer and subsequent termination, the Province of Salta failed to seek a prior judicial order to lift MsMarina del Valle Guancas trade union protection, as required by the case law of the National Labour Court of Appeal, Court II: in a ruling of  May , in Alvarez, Maximiliano and Others v. Cencosud SA, the latter granted the right to trade union stability including to leaders of unions which were in the process of being set up and had not yet obtained trade union registration. The Office of the State Public Prosecutor also found that the trade union leader in question did not enjoy the right to prior judicial dispensation before her dismissal.
.As to the Provinces response in Guanca, Marina del Valle v. Province of Salta; Secretariat of Medical Assistance and Social Welfare in re: Trade Union Protection? File No. /, heard by the Administrative Court of First Instance, the Province of Salta explicitly acknowledges, in yet another display of bad faith, that the administrative file pertaining to the case has been removed.
.The complainant organization further alleges that, on  August , it applied to the Ministry of Finance and Public Works for a check-off code (cdigo de descuento) enabling it to deduct trade union dues, commercial and mutual loans, supplementary health insurance and financial or bank credits from its members?wages. ATAP based that application in particular on the principles of the ILOs Committee on Freedom of Association and Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.ATAP adds that, on  November , having received no answer whatsoever, it sought a prompt response to its application in the abovementioned case. On  January , having still received no answer from the Ministry of Finance and Public Works, ATAP reiterated its original application. On  February , the legal adviser of the Ministry of Finance and Public Works of the Province formally requested a photocopy of the trade union status of ATAP, stating that the aim was to allow the application in the abovementioned case to be followed up, conscious of the fact that, at provincial level, Decree No. / is still in force, section  of which allows the check-off or deduction of legally authorized trade union dues in the case of bodies with trade union status?
.ATAP stated on  February, again in connection with the same case, that it renewed its application for a check-off code. It also reaffirmed the basis in law for its application, citing the recommendations of the ILOs supervisory bodies, and a series of international standards which are contained in Argentine law and have constitutional rank as well as being included in the case law of the Supreme Court of the Nation.
.ATAP believes that the decision by the Ministry of Finance and Public Works of the Province to delay and/or refuse the grant of a check-off code violates the freedom of association provided for in ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and .
.Through resolution No. / of  March , the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare of the Province decided to: Article . Reject the application made by the Association of Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration in the light of the content of the preamble.?The preamble states, among other things, that: Pursuant to section  of Act No. , only associations with trade union status, not those which are merely registered, may deduct trade union dues.?As noted in the proceedings, the Association of Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration has only legal personality (resolution No. / of the National Ministry of Labour and Social Security).?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The complainant organization further submits that on  March  it sought review of a decision by the provincial executive, citing infringement of civil rights and violation of and/or discrimination against the freedom of association of three of its members.
.In fact, following a long period of psychological and work-related harassment by the management, the three ATAP representatives, permanent members of staff at the General Tax Directorate of the Province, Sergio Martn Zamboni, finance secretary, Ftima Elizabeth Gramajo, third substitute member and Walter Rodolfo Alderete, second regular member of the electoral board, were formally removed from their original places of work without any legal grounds whatsoever, in violation of freedom of association, through Decree No.  of  February  signed by the Ministry of Finance and Public Works, the Secretary-General of the Interior and the Governor, and published in Official Journal No.  of  February .
.On  February , ATAP formally notified the then Provincial",-1,2007,Argentina

.By its communication dated  October , the Government transmits the report of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare of the Province of Salta, in which it is indicated, in respect of Ms Marina del Valle Guancas case, that a decree on her reinstatement in her previous job is under preparation and will be communicated. Furthermore, with regard to the check-off code requested by ATAP, enabling it to deduct trade union dues, commercial and mutual loans, supplementary health insurance and financial or bank credits from its members?wages, the Government indicates that if registered trade unions have the right to deduct trade union dues from their members (section (d) of Law No. .), the administrative authority (as an employer) is not required to authorize this check-off code for such associations, unless a voluntary agreement to this effect concluded by the various parties has been duly communicated.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the Association of Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration of Salta (ATAP) alleges that the executive of the Province of Salta: () in the first instance changed the working conditions of the trade union leader, Ms Marina del Valle Guanca, who was subsequently terminated through Decree No. /, by reason of her membership of the audit committee of the ATAP management committee, and despite the fact that there was no prior judicial order to lift her trade union protection; () transferred from their workplaces three ATAP trade union leaders who were permanent members of staff at the General Tax Directorate of the Province, Sergio Martn Zamboni, finance secretary, Ftima Elizabeth Gramajo, third substitute member and Walter Rodolfo Alderete, second regular member of the electoral board. Furthermore, the Committee observes that, two years after ATAP had applied for a check-off code to enable it to deduct the trade union dues of its members, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare of the Province rejected that request, in violation of the principles of freedom of association.
.With regard to the allegation that the executive of the Province of Salta changed, in the first instance, the working conditions of the trade union leaders, Ms Marina del Valle Guanca, and finally dismissed her though Decree No. /, because of her membership of the audit committee of the ATAP management committee, despite the fact that no prior judicial order had been issued to lift her trade union protection, the Committee notes with interest the Governments indication that a decree on her reinstatement in her previous job is under preparation and will be communicated. In these circumstances, the Committee expects that the decree on reinstatement without loss of pay of the trade union leader Ms Marina del Valle Guanca will be adopted without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.As to the alleged transfer from their workplace of three ATAP leaders who were permanent members of staff at the General Tax Directorate of the Province, Sergio Martn Zamboni, finance secretary, Ftima Elizabeth Gramajo, third substitute member and Walter Rodolfo Alderete, second regular member of the electoral board, the Committee notes that the Government did not provide its observations and requests it to ensure that an investigation is carried out into the matter without delay and, should it be found that the three were transferred on anti-union grounds, to take steps to ensure their immediate reinstatement in their former posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.As to the allegation that, in violation of the principles of freedom of association, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare of the Province rejected the application made by ATAP two years ago for a check-off code to enable it to deduct the trade union dues of its members, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, if registered trade unions have the right to deduct trade union dues from their members (section (d) of Law No. .), the administrative authority (as an employer) is not required to authorize this check-off code for such associations, unless a voluntary agreement to this effect concluded by the various parties has been duly communicated. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to take steps in order to facilitate an agreement between ATAP and the relevant authorities of the Province of Salta on the deduction of trade union dues from members?wages.

194,".The present complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of State Workers (ATE) dated  September .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the ATE states that it is presenting a complaint against the Government of Argentina for violating ILO Convention No.  through anti-union discrimination and reprisals by the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development, a body subordinate to the Cabinet Office. The ATE states that the present complaint concerns the following violations: (a) the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development has systematically violated the principle of good faith in bargaining by discriminating against one trade union organization signatory to the collective labour agreement (CLA); and (b)there have been tendencies to persecute and take reprisals against representatives of the workers of that organization.
.The complainant organization states that it has carried out trade union activities at the Department in question for a long time, even when this Department was under the authority of the Ministry for Social Development, the Ministry of Health and, as now, the Directorate of the Ministers?Cabinet. Thus, on  October , an electoral process took place to elect the internal board of the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development. The mandate of this body ran from  October  until  October . On  November , the ATEs executive council for Buenos Aires notified the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development of the results of the electoral process, with the names of the representatives elected by workers at the organization in question. The same notification was sent to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security on December  (No. ..).
.The ATE states that, in this context and in the face of excessive hiring of workers outside the legal mechanisms established by CLA No. / (to which the ATE is signatory), and given that this excessive hiring of short-term contract workers was being used to bypass not only salary mechanisms but also, and above all, the employment stability of public officials, the internal board of trade union representatives demanded that such workers be regularized. In this context, and given the knowledge that the employer, through its representative, had held a meeting on  February  with the National Civil Servants?Union (UPCN) to address matters pertaining to the CLA, the ATE sent a letter dated  February , as follows:Buenos Aires, February . ?In the name of and representing the National Executive Board of the Association of State Workers (ATE), we are writing to you because it has come to our attention that the ATE was excluded from participating in the meeting held on February of this year under the auspices of the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development, which involved only one of the trade union bodies eligible for the purpose. The agreement signed on  February implies a commitment between the Secretary of State for the Environment and Sustainable Development and only one of the sectors representative associations, while the Department has refused to reply to our organizations innumerable salary claims. The attitude assumed constitutes unfair practice under the terms of section  of the National Law on Trade Union Associations, No. . In view of the above, given that the ATE is one of the representative bodies signatory to the collective labour agreement (CLA) endorsed by Decree No. /, and as the conduct displayed threatens the guarantee to democratize labour relations, as well as the principle of freedom of association enshrined in our national Constitution and international treaties of constitutional rank (ILO Conventions Nos  and ), we demand that such conduct ceases on pain of a complaint being raised under Acts Nos  and , and before the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The ATE states that, notwithstanding the above, the internal board of the ATE on  March  presented a petition to the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development requesting an interview in order to present the relevant trade union complaints. This request was based on individual claims and the Department therefore refused to hear the internal boards representation. Faced with the ATEs trade union actions, the authorities behaved in an anti-union and discriminatory manner, refusing to talk to the organization and exacting reprisals against its representatives.
.The ATE alleges that the stance taken by the State has been to order the transfer of two representatives and relieve a third one of his functions, and to discriminate against the ATE by holding meetings within the framework of CLA No. / with only one representative trade union body. In fact, the employer ordered the transfer of Ms Patricia Hebe Bez Rocha and representative Mr Matas Javier Osterc, and relieved the organizations general delegate, Ms Alicia Rodrguez, of her functions.
.Having become aware of this subjugation, the ATE sent a letter to Dr Picolotti on March , as follows:Buenos Aires, March . ?In the name of and representing the National Council of Management of the Association of State Workers, we are writing to you because it has come to our attention that changes have been ordered to the working conditions of our representative Patricia Hebe Bez Rocha, identity card No. .., who performs her duties in the organization which you head. In that regard, as you are aware (notification from the council of management dated  November ), Ms Bez Rocha was elected on  October  as spokesperson for this associations internal board within the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development and, consequently, your actions violate the legal protection established under sections  and  of Act No. , section  of Act No. , articlebis of the Constitution, as well as international treaties and ILO Conventions Nos  and . In view of all the above, we demand that, within not more than  hours, you revoke the changes in working conditions of the above employee, reinstate her in her post and desist from this anti-union and persecuting attitude, on pain of the appropriate legal action, a complaint to the ILO and an action for disloyal practices. You have been duly notified.
.To the transfer and persecution of ATE representatives can be added the discriminatory attitude shown by holding meetings with only one of the trade union bodies in the sector signatory to the CLA, despite repeated requests from the complainant that a solution be found to the problems of workers existing in the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development. The ATE alleges that, on  July , the State, as the employer, held a meeting with the UPCN, without even inviting the ATE, in order to move forward on the requests that the ATE had previously made, and also on matters relating to the CLA, to which both trade union organizations are signatory. Consequently, on  July  a letter was sent to the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development as follows:Buenos Aires, July . ?In the name of and representing the National Council of Management of the Association of State Workers (ATE), we are writing to you because it has come to our attention that our organization was excluded from participating in the meeting held on  July  under the auspices of the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development, which involved only one of the trade union bodies eligible for the purpose. In fact, the document signed on  July shows an agreement between the Department and one trade union concerning matters relating to working conditions and CLA No. / at the Department, while our organization has been refused replies to the innumerable labour-related requests it has made. The attitude assumed constitutes unfair practice under the terms of section  of the National Law on Trade Union Associations, No.  and is one more piece of behaviour that demonstrates the discrimination occurring against our organization within the Department. In view of the above, given that the ATE is one of the signatory representative bodies to the CLA endorsed by Decree No. /, and as the conduct you have displayed threatens the guarantee to democratize labour relations, as well as the principle of freedom of association enshrined in our national Constitution and international treaties of constitutional rank (ILO Conventions Nos  and ), we demand that you cease such conduct on pain of a complaint being raised under Acts Nos  and , and before the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The ATE states, however, that not only has the Department remained silent in the face of this request, but on  August  another meeting was held with the UPCN behind the ATEs back. In summary, the Argentine State, through the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development, has systematically violated the fundamental collective and trade union rights of workers.

195,"Environment and Sustainable Development can be seen from various angles, but taken together they show clear anti-union activity because the employer is the same in all cases. First, there have been reprisals against workers?representatives for participating in trade union action and defending the rights of their peers, that is to say, discrimination on the grounds of participation in a trade union. Second, the employer has adopted a reluctant attitude towards bargaining and has violated collective labour principles, which constitutes discrimination and bad faith in bargaining.
.According to the ATE, workers and representatives who complained that staff were being hired outside the legal mechanisms of the CLA and that the stability of employment of civil servants was being violated, were persecuted, being subjected to transfers, being relieved of duties, and being subjected to non-payment of salaries, discrimination and violence in the workplace, among other irregularities in the Department.
.Three representatives of the ATE internal board, Ms Bez Rocha, Mr Osterc and MsRodrguez, have suffered the consequences of pursuing trade union activities in the form of being transferred or relieved of their duties despite enjoying trade union immunity. It should be noted, with respect to Ms Bez Rocha, that a reinstatement action was brought (Bez Rocha, Patricia Hebe v. Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development, complaints, summary proceedings? which resulted in a reinstatement ruling and an acknowledgement that the Department had violated current trade union laws and that there had been unlawful practices in the process of hiring the staff concerned. Nevertheless, the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development continued to persecute and mistreat the other representatives (and the union in general) and to relieve them of their duties.
.The complainant organization alleges bad faith in bargaining on the part of the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development, which has systematically refused to negotiate with the ATE regarding complaints and the actual circumstances of workers in the organization. Thus, on  February , it held a meeting with representatives of only the UPCN, evidence of this being the letter sent by the ATE on  February . Regardless of the request sent, after exacting reprisals against ATE representatives, the Department again met with the UPCN to address matters relating to the sectoral CLA, signing an agreement on  July . In the face of these new acts of discrimination, the ATE sent a letter on  July  requesting that the Department refrain from negotiating with only one of the parties as this constituted discrimination. The Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development, ignoring the ATEs request, met again with the UPCN on  August .
.The ATE states that this attitude is contrary to the principle of good faith in bargaining established in Act No.  concerning collective labour agreements between the national civil service and its employees, section  of which states: The parties shall be obliged to bargain in good faith. This principle places upon the parties the following rights and obligations ?(b) to hold meetings that may be necessary in appropriate locations and with appropriate frequency and regularity ?(e) to make efforts to reach agreements that take into account the diverse circumstances involved.?It is the understanding of the ATE that the actions of the administration in refusing to bargain collectively within the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development and in taking decisions unilaterally constitute an unfair practice which is reflected not only in its refusal to bargain collectively with a trade union association eligible to do so, but also in its delaying tactics which have the effect of obstructing the bargaining process; in that respect the conduct of the State, as the employer, in the bargaining process shows a clear attitude of bad faith contrary to the spirit of the domestic and international legislation mentioned above.
.In its communication of  July , the Government denies that the administration has persecuted and exacted reprisals against workers?representatives of the complainant organization. The Government states, with regard to Ms Bez Rocha, that she initiated legal action, as recounted in Bez Rocha, Patricia Hebe v. Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development, complaints, summary proceedings?(judicial proceedings No./), and also applied for interim measures of protection (Case No./, Bez Rocha, Patricia Hebe v. Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development, constitutional protection?, citing the fact that her working conditions had been altered, and claiming protection under sections ,  and  of Trade Union Act No. . Rulings have been given in both cases. The Government states, furthermore, that a legal ruling exists which was given after the case had been heard, in accordance with the procedure established in law. During the case, the plaintiff was represented by the ATEs own lawyers, exercising the rights accorded to her in law. As a result, the Government considers it unreasonable and without basis in fact or in law to present a complaint to the ILO, given that the national legal system has already dealt with the case.
.With regard to Mr Osterc and Ms Rodrguez, the Government states that they have never been transferred or relieved of their duties. This is confirmed by the service certificates presented by their superiors in charge of the areas for which they were hired, and by the contracts they signed. Neither their contracts nor their services were interrupted throughout  and the same situation has continued this year.
.The Government adds that it is important to highlight the open channel of communication that has always existed between the ATE and the human resources unit of the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development. The Departments human resources unit has always dealt with all formal and informal requests made to the administration to deal with all aspects considered important, even those which were not within the competence of the Department, which were referred to the relevant departments, for example national parity with regard to salary increases and moving staff onto permanent contracts. The Department has not maintained silence in the face of the ATEs requests, as can been seen from the reply sent to the ATE in a letter dated  March , in which the Department denied that it had engaged in unfair practice or infringed the principles of freedom of association. The same letter also made it clear that various meetings had been held with the organization in question at which the Department responded to all concerns raised.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant alleges that, after the internal board of ATE representatives began to submit complaints of excessive hiring of short-term contract workers by the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development without respecting the legal mechanisms established by the collective labour agreement, the authorities responsible for that Department: () held meetings with the UPCN to address matters relating to the collective agreement without inviting the ATE or responding to its salary claims, although the ATE is party to the collective agreement endorsed by Decree No. /; and () decided, as part of a campaign of reprisals and persecution, to transfer trade union representatives Ms Patricia Hebe Bez Rocha (who won a legal action for reinstatement) and Mr Matas Javier Osterc, and to relieve trade union representative Ms Alicia Rodrguez of her duties.
.With regard to the allegations of anti-union discrimination against three ATE leaders (transfer and subsequent reinstatement of Ms Bez Rocha, transfer of Mr Osterc and decision to relieve Ms Rodrguez of her duties), the Committee takes note of the Governments statements to the effect that: () in the case of trade union leader Ms Bez Rocha, the judicial authorities issued a ruling ordering her reinstatement to similar duties to those she had been performing or, failing that, to other duties compatible with her new situation, with payment of wages due; and () contrary to the complainants allegations, Mr Osterc and Ms Rodrguez have never been transferred or relieved of their duties and neither their contracts nor their services were interrupted at any point during  or, so far, in . In these circumstances, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of these allegations.
.With regard to the allegation that the authorities in the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development held meetings with the UPCN ?even signing an agreement on July  ?to address matters relating to the collective agreement, without inviting the ATE or responding to its salary claims, although the ATE is party to the collective agreement endorsed by Decree No. /, the Committee takes note of the Governments statements to the effect that: () it is important to highlight the open channel of communication that has always existed between the ATE and the human resources unit of the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development; () the Departments human resources unit has always dealt with all formal and informal requests made to the administration to deal with all aspects considered important, even those which were not within the competence of the Department, which were then referred to the relevant departments, for example national parity with regard to salary increases and moving",-1,2007,Argentina
196,"staff onto permanent contracts; and () the Department has not maintained silence in the face of the ATEs requests, as can be seen from the reply sent to the ATE in a letter dated  March , in which the Department denied that it engaged in any unfair practice or infringed the principles of freedom of association.
.In this regard, the Committee observes that, although the Government states that there is an open channel of communication with the ATE and that it has on numerous occasions met with representatives of the organization to discuss all matters considered important, it neither responds to nor denies the specific allegations that it has excluded the ATE from meetings which it held with the UPCN to address matters relating to the collective agreement in force, to which the ATE is signatory. In these circumstances, observing that the ATE has trade union personality (recognition as one of the most representative organizations which, among other benefits, grants it the right to bargain collectively) and is signatory to the collective labour agreement, in relation to which the authorities of the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development held meetings with the UPCN (which also has trade union personality), the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the ATE is not subject to discrimination when meetings are held concerning the collective agreement in force to which ATE is party.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Observing that the ATE has trade union personality (recognition as one of the most representative organizations which, among other benefits, grants it the right to bargain collectively) and is signatory to the collective labour agreement, in relation to which the authorities of the Department of the Environment and Sustainable Development held meetings with the UPCN (which also has trade union personality), the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the ATE is not subject to discrimination when meetings are held concerning the collective agreement in force to which the ATE is party.",-1,2007,Argentina
197,".The complaint is contained in communications from the General Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina (CETRA) and the Federation of Teachers of the Province of Buenos Aires (UDOCBA) dated  May and  July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege that Act No.  respecting joint negotiations for teachers in the Province of Buenos Aires provides in section  that in order to participate in negotiations, trade union organizations shall collectively represent all the teachers covered by the Teachers?Statute throughout the Province. They add that, even though no union was accredited as complying with this legal requirement, four unions and the State, as the employer, concluded an agreement, without the presence of all the unions representing teachers. According to the complainant organizations, unions are currently participating in the joint negotiations which do not comply with the requirements set out in the Act and in any case joint negotiations should not be held until a new law has been approved or all the unions representing greater or smaller proportions of teachers should participate.
.The Committee notes the Governments indications that: () it is a constitutional principle (article , indent , of the Constitution of the Province) that workers shall be guaranteed the right to negotiate their labour conditions. To this effect, Act No.  was drawn up as the first law regulating collective bargaining in the public administration at the provincial level, based on the consensus achieved between the representatives of the State and of all the unions representing workers in the public administration. The only requirement was that the unions should have legal personality. The above Act was the forerunner of Act No.  respecting joint negotiations for teachers in the Province, to which the complainant organizations refer; and () Act No.  establishes a criterion that differs from that of the Act covering the central administration, as it only accepts for the purposes of general bargaining unions whose individual and territorial action includes all teachers throughout the territory of the Province of Buenos Aires.
.The Committee further notes the Governments indications that: (i) collective bargaining in the teaching sector had its origin, albeit informal, in the round table that was held in the premises and at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour of the Province, until the approval of Act No.  of  October , and that the UDOCBA was present at all the meetings held, the purpose of which was to examine and reach agreement on the Act respecting joint negotiations for teachers, and that the approval of Act No.  formally established the machinery for collective bargaining in the sector. The UDOCBA participated actively in the first meeting and then in those held on  and  November ; (ii) the discussion concerning the issue of union representation was difficult, with very set and entrenched positions, despite the policy of persuasion followed by the Ministry of Labour, which constantly endeavoured to argue against the positions adopted by union representatives that the UDOCBA was not competent to participate in general bargaining. The Government affirms that the basic dispute is an inter-union matter and not germane to the joint negotiations themselves; (iii) the National Directorate of Culture and Education requested the Ministry of Labour of the Province to initiate general negotiations, in accordance with Act No. , as amended, and as required by Act No.  (Act respecting joint negotiations for teachers, as recently approved), and the Ministry of Labour of the Province convened all the unions with legal personality, including the UDOCBA; accordingly, the following unions were convened: the FEB, SUTEBA, UDA, AMET and the UDOCBA; (iv) the four unions that were convened, as well as the UDOCBA, have legal personality covering the whole of the Province of Buenos Aires; and (v) when the formalities had been completed for the establishment of the negotiating commission (accreditation and examination of the credentials presented for each union, number of dues-paying members of each union, etc.), and in view of the existence of more than one union with legal personality, and the discrepancies in union representation in terms of the territorial and individual scope of each union, the General Directorate of Culture and Education urged the teachers?unions to propose, in light of trade union independence and the legal scope of each union, the manner in which the representation of workers at the general level would be determined, since the State as the employer does not choose?the entity with which it negotiates.
.The Committee further notes the Governments indication that a meeting was held on November  during which the FEB and SUTEBA indicated that the representation of workers at the general level should be entrusted to their organizations, with in addition the participation of the UDA and AMET. They opposed the participation of the UDOCBA on two grounds: (a) its legal scope; and (b) the court action that it has initiated claiming that section  of Act No. , respecting joint negotiations for teachers, is unconstitutional. The Government adds that, in these circumstances, the UDOCBA withdrew from the meeting. The Government states that the non-participation of the UDOCBA in the general bargaining commission under Act No.  is an inter-union dispute, which is entirely unrelated to the General Directorate of Culture and Education in its capacity as the employer. The Committee finally notes the Governments indication that a draft amendment has been proposed to section  of Act No.  respecting joint negotiations for teachers and that it is currently before Parliament (the draft text communicated by the Government provides that the representation of teachers shall be carried out by all unions of teachers with legal personality entitling them to be active throughout the territory of the Province of Buenos Aires).
.In this respect, the Committee observes that the documentation provided by the complainant organizations consists of an agreement signed by the SUTEBA, FEB, UDA and AMET and the representatives of the State in its capacity as the employer requesting the Ministry of Labour to declare the formal establishment of joint negotiations at the general level with that representation of workers. The Committee also observes that the Government has not provided full information on the representativity in the sector of all the unions mentioned and particularly the UDOCBA. In any case, according to the information provided, all the unions concerned, including the complainant organization (UDOCBA), are trade unions with legal personality (in accordance with the Act respecting trade union associations, legal personality is granted to trade unions which, among other requirements, demonstrate membership of over  per cent of the workers whom they aim to represent and their exclusive rights include participation in collective bargaining). Under these conditions, the Committee recalls that systems based on a sole bargaining agent (the most representative) and those which include all organizations or the most representative organizations in accordance with clear pre-established criteria for the determination of the organizations entitled to bargain are both compatible with Convention No. . Nevertheless, in view of the exclusion of the UDOCBA from joint negotiations in the sector, the Committee considers that the wording of section  of Act No. is not sufficiently clear and may lead to the potentially unjustified exclusion of trade unions from bargaining, particularly taking into account the fact that the UDOCBA had hitherto been invited to participate in bargaining.
.The Committee notes with interest the information provided by the Government that draft legislation has been submitted to the legislature to amend section  of Act No.  respecting joint negotiations for teachers. It notes the indication in the introductory paragraphs that the draft is guided by an essential precept of any democratic republic: the broadest possible participation of the actors in the area in which labour guidelines are to be agreed upon?and the provision that for the purposes of collective bargaining, representation shall be exercised by all teachers?unions whose legal personality entitles them to be active in the territory of the Province of Buenos Aires? The Committee expects that the draft legislation will be adopted in the very near future and that in the meantime the Government will take further measures to reconcile the interests of the unions concerned by the joint negotiations in the sector. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the legal action taken by the UDOCBA claiming that section  of Act No.  is unconstitutional.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Noting with interest the Governments indication that draft legislation has been submitted to the legislature of the Province to amend section  of Act No.  respecting joint negotiations for teachers, the Committee expects",5,2007,Argentina
198,"that the legislation will be adopted in the very near future and that, in the meantime, the Government will take measures to reconcile the interests of the unions concerned by the joint negotiations in the sector.

199,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of State Workers (ATE) and the Central of Argentinean Workers (CTA) of April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of April , the CTA and the ATE allege that the decision of the Ministry of Education of the Province of Salta to replace striking teachers with substitute teachers is in violation of Convention No. . The complainants indicate that article bis of the Argentine Constitution guarantees the right to strike as a fundamental right of trade unions. The second indent of article , paragraph , accords constitutional status to a series of international human rights treaties, including the  New York Covenants, thereby granting the same status to Convention No.  (Article , paragraph , of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and Article , paragraph, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights further specifies that States Parties undertake to ensure the right to strike (Article , paragraph (d)). This circle of protection for freedom of association is completed by the first indent of article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the Nation, which grants legal precedence to other international treaties, including ILO Conventions. Moreover, the Constitution of the Province of Salta guarantees all workers the exercise of the right to strike (articles (),  and ). The complainants indicate that, despite all the provisions formally protecting the right to strike, the Minister of Education of the Province of Salta, through resolution No. /, ordered the replacement of all teachers who had joined the strike called by the Association of State Workers. According to the complainants, this resolution is intended to crush the effectiveness of the strike and illegally discriminate against workers for participating in the strike by means of their replacement.
.The complainants observe that, on  February , the Ministry of Education of the Province of Salta was informed of the teaching sectors concerns over the recovery of their basic wage level. On  February , having received no reply to the previous letter requesting a salary increase, the ATE declared a state of alert and permanent mobilization and stated that, in the absence of a favourable response, direct action would be taken. The same letter was sent to the Provincial Directorate-General of Labour of the Province of Salta on the same date. Finally, and in the complete absence of any response, the ATE Provincial Board put into effect its declaration that direct action would be taken by declaring a stoppage and mobilization for an indefinite period as of  March . The same letter was sent to the Minister of Education.
.The complainants explain that the protest measures were very intensive, with the participation of the majority of workers in the sector and that, as a result, the administration took action to undermine the effectiveness of the measures and to intimidate the workers who participated in them. They allege that the measures taken included secret investigations of the strikers and persons connected with them, as well as the union leaders involved in the collective dispute. The investigations were allegedly carried out by the Salta police. A blacklist?was drawn up on the basis of reports from the above investigations, containing the names of workers who participated actively in the union action. In this context, the Minister of Education for the Province of Salta issued resolution No. / of  March , in which it was decided to replace?the striking teachers with substitute teachers, which is a clear manoeuvre to crush and destroy the strike.
.The complainants transcribe the provisions of the resolution which are as follows: Section  ?Authorize the General Directorates of General Basic Education and Initial Education, Polimodal Education, Special Schemes and Higher Education to cover the teaching functions currently not being fulfilled due to the withdrawal of their staff as a result of their involvement in the protest action, thereby jeopardizing the effective and continuous provision of the service, and consequently being under the obligation to provide coverage in accordance with the Points Scales until the return of the above to their habitual functions on a regular basis. Section  ?The staff members designated under these specific circumstances shall effectively discharge the service in practice, ceasing to do so upon the return of the staff responsible for such functions. Section  ?It shall be the responsibility of the administrative team and/or the Supervisor to adopt the appropriate procedure to give effect to the above provisions.?The resolution was implemented in institutions under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education of the Province of Salta as from  March .
.According to the complainants, it should be emphasized that the court ruling that the Minister invoked as the basis?for the above resolution nowhere orders the replacement of striking workers, but that education should be guaranteed. What is more, it does not support the claim of amparo (protection of constitutional rights) in relation to the replacement of strikers. Accordingly, if it is interpreted correctly, the Minister has violated the court ruling which she says and claims to be following, thereby aggravating the violation of freedom of association as, in full knowledge that such a measure cannot be taken, she intentionally did so to break the work stoppage. Moreover, on  April  the administration announced in the daily newspaper with the biggest circulation that a joint resolution, Nos  and , had been issued under the terms of which teachers who returned to work on the first working day of April ( April ) and undertook to discharge their functions effectively and without interruption (that is, renouncing the right to strike), would have their wages for the strike days paid in instalments. While this is a much less coercive act by the Ministry, with the intention of persuading?or inducing?the strikers to end the stoppage, it is also an act of discrimination as those who refuse to end the strike will have their wages deducted in full. These are the acts that led to the presentation of the present complaint.
.According to the complainants, this is a manoeuvre by the government of the Province of Salta, through the Ministry of Education and the Salta police, to weaken, obstruct and undermine the effectiveness of the strike. The replacement of the strikers was intended solely to intimidate and discipline state workers in general. The complainants emphasize that, although it is true that some limitations may be imposed on the exercise of the right to strike, especially in relation to public employees as, a priori, certain categories in the public sector could be classified as essential services (although under Argentine law this classification is confined to specific activities that do not include public employment in general), such considerations go beyond the context of the present case. In this respect, the provincial State does not refer to any restriction or difficulty related to this issue, but simply confines itself to penalties which discriminate against those who took part in the strike. The complainants consider that this demonstrates a clear violation of freedom of association by the Province of Salta, which penalized workers for participating in a strike, replacing them with substitute teachers to break the strike, in violation of Articles  and  of Convention No. .
.In its communication of  January , the Government indicates that, as the complainants are challenging the action of a provincial government, it should be recalled that under the federal system of government the provinces are free to take the action that they consider appropriate in terms of managing their respective provincial administrations, without interference by the national Government. In that regard, and as this case concerns resolution No.  of the Ministry of Education of Salta, which authorizes the use of substitute teachers to cover the duties of the teachers on strike for an indefinite period of time, the Government notes that the dispute was resolved by voluntary conciliation between the government of the Province of Salta and the union representatives of the teachers on  and  April , with classes recommencing in schools on  April as a result of the cessation of the protest action. Under the terms of the agreement, it was envisaged that effect would not be given to resolutions Nos ,  and  of the Ministry of Education and the related administrative measures, and a proposal was made for a wage increase and the payment of strike days, with the recuperation of the classes that had been lost. Finally, the Government observes that the disputed provincial resolution was not given effect and that the grounds that gave rise to this freedom of association case no longer exist, with the result that the matter has therefore been resolved.
.The Committee notes that in the",0,2007,Argentina
200,"present case the complainant organizations challenge resolution No. / of  March of the Ministry of Education of the Province of Salta, which envisaged the replacement of all the teachers who participated in the work stoppage and mobilization for an indefinite period as of  March . The complainants indicate that the work stoppage was decided upon in view of the absence of a reply by the authorities of the Ministry of Education of the Province to the communication that they sent on  February expressing the concern of teachers to recover the level of their basic wage and requesting a wage increase. The Committee also notes the serious allegations of the complainant organizations that the resolution was intended to undermine the effectiveness of the stoppage (they add that, in this respect, under the terms of resolutions Nos  and , workers who returned to work on the first working day of the month of April and who undertook to discharge their functions effectively and without interruption would, if they had participated in the stoppage, be paid the strike days in instalments): the resolutions were also intended to intimidate workers who participated in the strike (according to the complainants, in particular the police of the Province had undertaken secret investigations on the strikers and a blacklist was drawn up containing the names and number of strikers, based on the reports of the investigations).
.The Committee notes the Governments indications that: () the dispute was resolved through voluntary conciliation between the government of the Province of Salta and the union representatives of the teachers on  and  April , with classes recommencing on  April as a result of the lifting of the protest action; and () under the terms of the agreement, it was envisaged that effect would not be given to resolutions Nos ,  and  of the Ministry of Education and the related administrative measures, combined with a proposed wage increase and the payment of the strike days, with the recuperation of the classes that had been lost.
.Taking into account the information on the agreement that was reached, under the terms of which effect was not given to the administration measures and penalties were not imposed for participation in the strike, the Committee will not proceed with its examination of the allegations made in the present case. The Committee nevertheless feels it is necessary to recall the principle that the hiring of workers to break a strike in a sector which cannot be regarded as an essential sector in the strict sense of the term, and hence one in which strikes might be forbidden, constitutes a serious violation of freedom of association?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ], and the importance of the principle that workers who exercise their right to strike peacefully should not be subject to intimidation of any type.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that the present case does not call for further examination.",3,2007,Argentina
201,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) of April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  April , the CTA and the CTERA report a situation of unusual severity, with adverse effects not only on the education workers in Neuqun Province that belong to the Association of Education Workers of Neuqun (ATEN), a trade union that forms part of the CTERA, but also on all workers in Argentina, which is the reason for submitting the complaint.
.The complainants refer to the police repression against education workers in the abovementioned province on  April , which resulted in the murder of teacher Carlos Fuentealba. According to the complainants, in addition to the violation of the right to life as a result of the crime committed because of the political decision by the Governor of the province to suppress the mobilization of teachers, as a result of the extreme violence that has been reported, the teachers of Neuqun Province have been denied the right to strike. Furthermore, the issuance by the provincial authorities of Decree No.  on educational emergency? dated  April  and published in the Official Gazette of the Province No., specifically provides for the appointment of teachers on an interim basis until the end of the strike called by ATEN, a first level trade union affiliated to CTERA.
.The complainants indicate that, in accordance with the statutes of the CTA and the CTERA, which have been duly registered with the National Ministry of Labour, and with the specific provisions of Act No.  on trade union associations, trade unions are guaranteed, in terms of collective freedom of association, the right to formulate their own action plans and to carry out any lawful activity to defend the interests of workers. In particular, they may exercise the right to bargain collectively, the right to participate, the right to strike and the right to take other forms of legitimate trade union action?(article(d) of Act No. ). In addition, the National Constitution provides that: Trade unions are guaranteed the right to enter into collective agreements, the right to have recourse to conciliation and arbitration and the right to strike?(section bis, second paragraph). It is clear that, according to the Constitution, the first step is to negotiate, reach agreement, restore balance, correct inequities and ensure bargaining parity between unions and employers through the introduction of legislation negotiated as part of a collective agreement; the next step is to establish dispute prevention mechanisms based on conciliation and voluntary arbitration (although the Constitution does not indicate whether this should be a government activity); and the final step, as a last resort, is to use union power to exercise the right to strike. The complainants indicate that the Constitution does not set any limits or conditions in this regard.
.The complainants indicate that the right to strike may be invoked and exercised even though there is no regulatory act passed by Congress governing this right, because exercising the right to strike does not require legislative regulation. Section bis of the National Constitution is complemented by the recognition of the constitutional status of human rights declarations and treaties provided for under section .. Of the human rights instruments, only the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights explicitly refers to the right to strike (article .(d)). Nevertheless, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the American Convention on Human Rights encompass the right to freedom of association as part of the right to strike. There are no ILO Conventions or Recommendations specifically governing the right to strike, but the right is seen as being implicit in the right to freedom of association enshrined in Convention No. .
.The complainants state that education is not an essential service and that the resolutions, decisions and opinions of the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association, as demonstrated in its handling of case No. , have established that education is not an essential service?
.The complainants are of the view that the indiscriminate repression of education workers which led to the murder of Mr Carlos Fuentealba and the abovementioned Decree by the authorities of Neuqun Province declaring a state of emergency?in the provinces education system and establishing a mechanism that clearly prevents teachers from exercising their right to strike are totally unacceptable. It is manifestly inappropriate and no less than absurd to try to claim that education is an essential service just when a measure of direct action is taken, when a demonstration is organized or when any sort of action is taken in protest against what teachers are experiencing, and what makes matters worse is that the behaviour of the Neuqun authorities is dangerously centred on the infamous victim blaming?theory in so far as explicit reference is made to the intention to make educators fully responsible for ensuring the provision of the service.
.The complainants indicate that section bis of the National Constitution clearly guarantees the establishment of free and democratic trade union organizations on mere registration in a special register. The section adds that: Trade unions are guaranteed the right to enter into collective agreements, the right to have recourse to conciliation and arbitration and the right to strike ?Likewise, under section (d) of Act No. , as mentioned above, as well as under section  of the same act, all trade unions have the right to formulate their own action plans and the right to represent the collective interests of all workers who are within the scope of union activity, whether or not they are union members. Decree No. / issued by the authorities of the province in question is directly aimed at preventing the legitimate enjoyment of the right to strike and at the same time involves an absolute refusal to enter into collective negotiations with the representative trade union regarding the working conditions of the education workers.
.Finally, the complainants state that the absurd police repression that resulted in the murder of teacher Carlos Fuentealba and Decree No.  of  April  on educational emergency issued by the authorities of Neuqun Province are illegal and violate freedom of association because they undermine the most fundamental of all rights, namely the right to life, and the right to strike of all workers.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that the complaint filed by the CTA and the CTERA is related to the dispute that ATEN entered into with the provincial authorities, which resulted in the pointless death of teacher Carlos Fuentealba. According to the Government, the situation warrants a thorough and detailed description of the events, which date from  February , when the trade union ATEN sent a note to the provincial authorities ?the Ministry of Education in particular ?calling for the launch of negotiations. At the outset, the Government firmly denies that any action was taken to restrict the freedom of association of the trade union organizations that staged the dispute in question.
.According to the Government, the unions used their rights under section bis of the National Constitution, which governs union activities and the enjoyment of the right to strike. They exercised, in the following order, the exclusive rights of trade unions, as provided for under article  of Act No. : ?a) to defend and represent the individual and collective interests of workers in dealings with the State and the employers; (b) to participate in the activities of institutions involved in planning and inspection, in accordance with the respective provisions; (c) to participate in collective negotiations and to monitor compliance with labour and social security regulations; (d) to collaborate with the State in examining and resolving workers?problems; (e) to establish earmarked funds which shall enjoy the same rights as cooperatives and mutual funds; and (f) to administer their own social welfare activities and, as appropriate, to participate in the administration of those undertaken pursuant to law or to collective labour agreements? It is the question of the enjoyment of these rights that prompted the series of events described below.
.On  February , the union sent a note to the provincial authorities, in response to which the provinces Minister of Education invited the union on  February to attend a hearing in order to give fair consideration to the list of issues raised by ATEN. The following issues were discussed: () information regarding the municipal infrastructure; () wage scale increases, in response to a call for a pay rise to , pesos; () fixed cash bonuses; () the complainant trade union ATEN indicated that it supported the strike to be held on ",5,2007,Argentina
202,"March for an unspecified duration if agreement was not reached. From the list of issues raised by ATEN, workers were offered: () the standardization of non-remunerative bonus elements in the basic wage; () the elimination of performance-based benefits (for ATEN, presenteeism?, instead making such benefits an element of the basic wage; () a further guarantee of a wage increase of no less than  pesos for those who already earned the minimum amount; () a commitment to instruct the Neuqun Social Security Institute to make the necessary arrangements to increase the variable percentage of the teachers?retirement allowance; () the establishment of a working group on granting contract staff regular staff status and on social programming in the education sector (non-teaching staff); () with regard to wages, the amount offered reached and exceeded the fixed national levels, the base amount offered being , pesos.
.The Government indicates that a wage agreement was effectively not reached. This prevented the provincial Government from pursuing a timely dialogue, without prejudice to the industrial action being taken by ATEN at the time. Nevertheless, another working group was established with finance officials from the Neuqun provincial authorities to find a solution to the wage claims raised during the dispute. While the negotiations were under way, the union took direct action which involved: () the non-initiation of the academic year; () the blocking of bridges; () the setting up of road blocks without warning in various parts of the province to cut off towns far from the provincial capital and to prevent commercial activity in the productive sector; () demonstrations in towns; and () threats of further action.
.The Government adds that the situation described above prevented the normal progression of the academic year, which meant that children were prevented from attending school in a normal and regular way. This situation led to numerous complaints from parents, causing unrest among civil society. Subsequently, faced with the impossibility of continuing the negotiations, the provincial Government proceeded to issue a compulsory conciliation order with the aim of restoring the pre-dispute status quo, so that education workers could return to their normal and regular jobs and so that dialogue could be resumed with the trade union in a climate of social peace. Although the application of Act No.  on compulsory conciliation was rejected by the union, the provincial authorities nevertheless agreed to increase the pay of new teachers to , pesos, with due account to the geographical location concerned. This proposal was also rejected. It should be noted that the conciliation process provides an opportunity for settlement and rapprochement and that, by exercising their autonomy and by making mutual concessions, it is the parties themselves that reach an agreement that should in theory reconcile their underlying differences. In such circumstances, it is unacceptable for the parties involved to be subjected to measures which restrict their freedom of negotiation. The power to request compulsory conciliation for a limited period is vested exclusively in the State for the purposes of ensuring social peace, and in no way can it be considered to be a violation of the principles of freedom of association because it will always be established for a limited period.
.According to the Government, it is of paramount importance to stress that schools in the Republic of Argentina not only provide a natural environment for educating children but also play a very important social role, as in many respects they exert a cohesive influence on various sectors of society, in particular in view of the fact that Neuqun Province occupies a vast territory, which means that many children have to travel many miles, often in adverse weather conditions, in order to attend school. Many publicly run schools in the Republic of Argentina therefore provide children with breakfast and lunch, which means that school attendance is of the utmost importance because the State provides additional support to families, taking into account that there are certain pockets of poverty in the region.
.The Government states that, because the trade unions felt unsatisfied with the proposals by the provincial authorities, they decided to take direct action, leading to the occupation of the bridges linking the cities of Cipolletti and Neuqun. On  April , a road block was set up on national road No. , at Arroyito, where there is an intersection of the roads leading to the tourist areas of southern Argentina (Bariloche, Villa La Angostura, Caviahue, El Bolsn and San Martn de los Andes, among others). When they heard about this measure, the Neuqun provincial authorities announced that they would not allow such a blockage and the demonstrators were requested to carry out their protest in the area of the Carancho bridge, in order to provide road users with an alternative route. This request was ignored by the protesters, who at that point included not only teachers but members of different trade unions and political associations. The police force was then called in to enter into dialogue with the union authorities to prevent the demonstrators from blocking the abovementioned road and thus to protect the rights of third parties who had nothing to do with the matter in question to the freedom of movement (a freedom which is protected by the Constitution). No agreement was reached. It was at this point that the police proceeded to clear the way to enable the free movement of the vehicles that had been brought to a standstill. Minutes later, teacher Carlos Fuentealba was unfortunately killed when a tear gas canister was fired. The provincial authorities have since identified those responsible and reports have been prepared leading to the dismissal from the Neuqun police of the perpetrators of the unfortunate event, who have subsequently been handed over to justice. With regard to the legal proceedings, the judge responsible for the case has indicated that the citizen Jos Daro Poblete was detained after questioning on  April  and, after a court hearing on  April of the same year, on the basis of a final decision.
.The contested Decree No.  declares a state of educational emergency throughout the province. It gives the Neuqun Province Education Council the power to appoint the interim managers and teaching staff needed in the various schools for the purpose of providing and guaranteeing an educational service and provides that such staff will be appointed until the situation returns to normal. This decision by the provincial authorities is in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Even though the education system is not considered to be an essential service, a crisis situation began to emerge when the academic year failed to begin, leading to unrest among parents and society as a whole. Thus, section  of the Decree in question that is being challenged by trade unions stipulates that the staff mentioned in section  will be appointed until the educational service returns to normal? Consequently, the claim that the Decree in question restricts freedom of association is categorically rejected, not only because the Decree was prepared in the spirit of the Committees recommendations, but also because the workers hired to provide replacement services for the strikers were recruited on an interim basis, as has been stated unequivocally. Significantly, the right to strike was not violated because the strike took place for the entire period called for by the union (two months) and wages are being paid to date for the days not worked as a result of participation in the strike, in accordance with an order by the board of the Neuqun Province Education Council, which is a tripartite body responsible for the implementation of the abovementioned Decree.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainants allege that Mr Carlos Fuentealba was killed on  April  during a demonstration by education workers in Neuqun Province which was suppressed by the police, and object to Decree No.  of April  on educational emergency, issued by the authorities of Neuqun Province, authorizing the appointment of teachers on an interim basis until the end of the strike called by ATEN.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the murder of teacher Mr Carlos Fuentealba, on  April , during a demonstration of education workers in Neuqun Province which was suppressed by the police, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: ()in the context of a dispute between ATEN and the authorities of the province in question, trade unions decided to take direct action which led to the occupation of bridges linking two cities and on  April  the establishment of a road block on national road No. , where there is an intersection of the roads leading to the tourist areas of southern Argentina; () the provincial authorities announced that they would not allow such a blockage and requested the demonstrators to carry out their protest in the area of the Carancho bridge, in order to provide road users with an alternative",3,2007,Argentina
203,"route; () the request was ignored by the protesters and consequently members of the police force were called in to enter into dialogue with the union authorities to prevent the demonstrators from blocking the road; () no agreement was reached and the police proceeded to clear the way to enable the free movement of vehicles; minutes later, teacher Carlos Fuentealba was killed when a tear gas canister was fired; () the provincial authorities identified those responsible and reports have been prepared leading to the dismissal of the perpetrators from the Neuqun police force, who have been handed over to justice; () as part of the legal proceedings, Mr Jos Daro Poblete was detained and tried.
.The Committee deeply regrets the death of the teacher, Mr Carlos Fuentealba, after a tear gas canister was fired by the police, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings against the person accused of causing his death. Likewise, the Committee recalls that it has underlined on numerous occasions that, although trade union rights include the right to organize public demonstrations, the prohibition of demonstrations on the public highway in the busiest parts of a city, when it is feared that disturbances might occur, does not constitute an infringement of trade union rights, and the authorities should strive to reach agreement with the organizers of the demonstration to enable it to be held in some other place where there would be no fear of disturbances?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , fifth edition, para. ]. The Committee notes in this respect that the Government tried to dissuade the demonstrators from setting up a road block and that only after they had refused did the Government send in the police force to enable the movement of vehicles. Nevertheless, taking into account the tragic consequences in this specific case, the Committee recalls that the authorities should resort to the use of force only in situations where law and order is seriously threatened. The intervention of the forces of order should be in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence when controlling demonstrations which might result in a disturbance of the peace.?[see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. At the same time, the Committee emphasizes that trade union organizations should conduct themselves responsibly and respect the peaceful manner in which the right of assembly should be exercised. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the above principles are respected and to give instructions to its security forces to this effect, so as to ensure proportionality and balance in the use of force and avoid any excesses.
.With regard to the contested Decree No.  of  April  on educational emergency issued by the authorities of Neuqun Province, authorizing the appointment of teachers on an interim basis until the end of the strike called by the Association of Education Workers of Neuqun (ATEN), the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () this Decree declared a state of educational emergency throughout the province, gave the Neuqun Province Education Council the power to appoint the management and education workers needed in the various schools for the purpose of providing and guaranteeing an educational service and provided that such staff would be appointed until the situation returned to normal; () this decision by the authorities is in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; () even though the education system is not considered to be an essential service, a crisis situation began to emerge when the academic year failed to begin, leading to unrest among parents and society as a whole; the Decree in question does not violate freedom of association, not only because it was drawn up in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee but also because the staff who were going to provide replacement services for the strikers were hired on an interim basis; and () the right to strike was not violated because the strike took place for the entire period called for by the union (two months) and wages are being paid to date for the days not worked as a result of participation in the strike, in accordance with an order by the board of the Neuqun Province Education Council, which is a tripartite body responsible for the implementation of the abovementioned Decree.
.The Committee recalls that, on numerous occasions, it has emphasized that the education sector does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term and that the hiring of workers to break a strike in a sector which cannot be regarded as an essential sector in the strict sense of the term, and hence one in which strikes might be forbidden, constitutes a serious violation of freedom of association?[see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls that it has also indicated that minimum services may be established in the education sector, in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strikes of long duration?[see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In the present case, the Committee observes that the Government has not supplied information on the number of workers replacing the workers on strike and has not denied that this measure was the result of a decree adopted without consultation with the trade unions concerned. In these circumstances, the Committee expects that, in the future, in the event of a dispute in the education sector in Argentina involving a strike of long duration, priority will be given to the establishment of minimum services, in full consultation with the social partners concerned, and that the appointment by the authorities, without consultations with the trade unions concerned, of staff to replace the striking workers will be avoided.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply regrets the killing by the police of the teacher, MrCarlos Fuentealba, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings against the person accused of his murder.(b) The Committee recalls that the authorities should resort to the use of force only in situations where law and order is seriously threatened. The intervention of the forces of order should be in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence when controlling demonstrations which might result in a disturbance of peace. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that this principle is respected and emphasizes that trade union organizations should conduct themselves responsibly and respect the peaceful manner in which the right of assembly should be exercised. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the above principles are respected and to give instructions to its security forces to this effect, so as to ensure proportionality and balance in the use of force and avoid any excesses.(c) The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that the right to strike is respected and expects that, in the future, in the event of a dispute in the education sector in Argentina involving a strike of long duration, priority will be given to the establishment of minimum services, in full consultation with the social partners concerned, and that the appointment by the authorities without consultations with the trade unions concerned of staff to replace the striking workers will be avoided.",-1,2007,Argentina
204,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras?] and on that occasion formulated the following recommendations:(a)	With regard to the forced entry by unidentified individuals at the offices of the Director of the CTAs legal service in February  and at the headquarters of the CTA in the federal capital in March , with the theft of computers, and (at the office of the Director of the legal service) of fax equipment, the Committee expects that the investigation to which the Government refers will be concluded in the near future and will make it possible to identify and punish those responsible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b)	With regard to the allegation that stones were thrown at the residence of MrAlejandro Garzn, General Secretary of the Provincial Executive Council of the ATE in Santa Cruz, and he and his family received telephone death threats, the Committee, noting the ATEs statements to the effect that it has made a formal complaint to the police, requests the Government to inform it of the action taken in connection with this complaint and the outcome of the investigations, stating in particular whether or not those responsible have been identified and punished.
.In its communication of  April , the Government indicates, in relation to the complaint presented by the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) concerning the forced entry by unidentified individuals into the offices of the Director of the CTAs legal service, that the Investigating Prosecutors Office No.  has reported that the case, involving unknown perpetrators, has been under examination by the Criminal Investigations Department since  November .
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee expects that the investigation into the forced entry by unidentified individuals into the offices of the Director of the CTAs legal service and the theft of computer equipment will be concluded without delay and that those responsible will be identified, tried and punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard as well as in relation to the investigations concerning: () the entry of unidentified persons into the headquarters of the CTA in the federal capital in March ; and () the allegation that stones were thrown at the residence of Mr Alejandro Garzn, the General Secretary of the Provincial Executive Council of ATE in Santa Cruz, and that he and his family received telephone death threats.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) dated April . The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) associated itself to the complaint in a communication dated  April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of April , the CTA states that as part of a campaign of intimidatory action directed at certain organizations connected with the defence of human rights in general and trade union rights in particular, on Sunday  February  a number of unidentified individuals broke into the offices of Dr Horacio Meguira, Director of the national legal service of the CTA. They went directly to Dr Meguiras own office and, significantly, did not bother to take any valuables but confined themselves to taking his computer and the fax machine which contained in its memory details of all calls sent and received. It is clear from the nature of what was taken ?the fax equipment and a number of documents ?that this was no ordinary robbery but something which must objectively be viewed as deliberate intimidation directed against members of the CTA. In the light of this, the CTA sought to instigate a judicial investigation into the crime. The case is being examined by the Criminal Investigation Department No. .
.The complainant organization adds that during the weekend of  and  March , the CTA headquarters in the federal capital, located at Carlos Calvo , were robbed of computers, although other valuables and money were not touched. According to the CTA, the modus operandi in this case bears a close resemblance to the one adopted by the individuals who broke into the offices of Dr Meguira. The CTA states that a report has been made to the police and interviews have been sought with the heads of security and human rights within the Buenos Aires municipal administration.
.Lastly, the CTA alleges that in the early morning of  March , stones were thrown at the home of Mr Alejandro Garzn, the general secretary of the Santa Cruz provincial executive council of the ATE, and both he and his family received telephone threats from unidentified individuals who said that they were going to attack him or his family. A complaint was made to the police, and the National Executive Council of the ATE has sent out letters making it clear that the national and Santa Cruz provincial authorities are responsible for the personal safety of Alejandro Garzn and his family, and of any other workers who exercise their constitutional right to strike, demonstrate and express themselves. The CTA considers that the alleged acts constitute intimidation and harassment carried out with the intention of restricting or obstructing the exercise of trade union rights by union bodies, union officials and the workers they represent.
.In its communication of  October , the Government, referring to the case of MrGarzn, denies that the alleged facts are in any way linked with the provincial authorities or that there can be even the suspicion of restrictions on trade union activities in the province. The Government emphasizes that the Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Security of the province has not been faced with any court summons, nor have the local offices from the province interior. The Government indicates that the complainant organization does not refer to the place where the complaint was lodged, which has made it difficult to trace. The Government also states that on  May , a conciliation hearing took place at the headquarters of the Deputy Minister for Labour and Social Security of Santa Cruz Province, attended by the ATE in the person of Mr Alejandro Garzn. An agreement was concluded recognizing the arrears of wages due during the dispute, and the workers undertook to refrain from further coercive action until such time as the joint meetings with the provincial government were concluded.
.The Government states that, as regards the incidents alleged to have occurred in the offices of Dr Miguera and at the CTA premises, the investigating attorney has carried out all the necessary procedures in connection with the complaint and that currently new elements are expected to come to light which should make it possible to identify those responsible for the acts in question. The Government states that it will keep the ILO informed of any progress made in the judicial investigation, to the extent that this is allowed under criminal proceedings.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that against a background of intimidation, unidentified individuals entered the offices of the director of the CTA legal service in February  and the headquarters of the CTA in the federal capital in March, appropriating only computers and, in the directors office, a fax machine. The complainant organization also alleges that the residence of the General Secretary of the provincial executive council of ATE in Santa Cruz, Mr Alejandro Garzn was attacked with stones and he and his family received telephone death threats.
.As regards the forced entry by unidentified individuals into the office of the director of the CTAs legal service in February  and of the national headquarters of the CTA in March, with the theft of computers and, in the directors office, of a fax machine, the Committee takes note of the Governments information that the investigating attorney has carried out all the necessary procedures in connection with the case, and new elements are expected to come to light which should make it possible to identify those responsible for the acts in question. The Committee recalls that the inviolability of trade union premises is a civil liberty which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. Under these circumstances the Committee, while deploring the alleged acts, expects that the investigation to which the Government refers will be concluded soon and will make it possible to identify and punish those responsible for the acts in question. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.As regards the allegation that the residence of Mr Alejandro Garzn, the General Secretary of the Santa Cruz Executive Council of ATE, was attacked with stones and that he and his family received telephone death threats, the Committee takes note of the Governments denial that the alleged acts have anything to do with the",1,2007,Argentina
205,"provincial authorities, or that there could be any suspicion of restrictions on freedom of association in the province. The Committee also takes note of the Governments statements to the effect that: () the Department of Labour and Social Security in the province has not been the subject of any legal complaints, nor have the local offices of the province interior; () the complainant organization does not refer to the place where the complaint was lodged, which has made it difficult to trace; () on  May , a conciliation hearing took place at the headquarters of the Department of Labour and Social Security of Santa Cruz Province, attended by the ATE in the person of Mr Alejandro Garzn. An agreement was concluded acknowledging the arrears of wages that had fallen due during the dispute, and the workers undertook to refrain from further coercive action until such time as joint meetings with the provincial government were concluded. Given the claim by the ATE that it lodged a formal complaint with the police, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the action taken in connection with this complaint and the outcome of the investigations, stating in particular whether or not those responsible have been identified and punished.
.In general, the Committee recalls that a climate of violence, coercion and threats of any type aimed at trade union leaders and their families does not encourage the free exercise and full enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in Conventions Nos  and . All States have the undeniable duty to promote and defend a social climate where respect of the law reigns as the only way of guaranteeing respect for and protection of life.?[see Digest, op. cit., para. ].

206,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of State Workers (ATE) dated  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  March , ATE alleges that the authorities of the Unified Autarchic Provincial Social Security Institute (IPAUSS) decided to transfer workers from the Ushuaia branch office, in the Province of Tierra del Fuego, to the Buenos Aires office, whose workers were engaged in a strike.
.The complainant states that, on  December , IPAUSS was informed of the decision taken by an assembly of the workers at its Buenos Aires branch to cease work until certain conflicts were resolved. This direct action was also communicated to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. ATE states that the demands being made were in response to systematic irregularities within the Institute that had been reported to its president. In particular, ATE rejected the removal and replacement of Ms Zalazar as head of the IPAUSS Buenos Aires office, as well as the appointment to the post of interim coordinator of persons from outside the institution, considering as it did that those posts should be filled by in-house staff with adequate competencies in the area of institutional management.
.ATE states that the direct actions were undertaken by a majority of the workers in the sector and that, by way of a response, the Institutes authorities have taken measures aimed at reducing the effectiveness of the actions and intimidating the workers. ATE alleges that the IPAUSS authorities decided, within the framework of those measures, to transfer workers serving with the Ushuaia and Ro Grande branch, in the Province of Tierra del Fuego, to the Buenos Aires branch, with a view to undermining the strike (from the documentation sent by ATE it emerges that ten workers were transferred between December  and January , for periods of up to five days and on different dates). ATE asserts that the replacement of striking workers is a violation of freedom of association.
.In its communication of  September , the Government outlines the alleged facts as follows:
.As regards the appointment of the interim coordinator of IPAUSS, the Government states that, in line with the information sent by the Undersecretariat of Labour of the province in question, within the framework of the duties conferred under Act No.  and Act No. and its implementing Decree No. /, it is the board of directors of IPAUSS that has the authority to appoint staff at the policy-making level, the so-called cabinet staff?and their concordantes, i.e. the team of public officials who work in association with them. Both the branch and the institutions coordination unit fall into this category, being officials to whom the right of stability at the cabinet level does not extend.
.Concerning the specific reference to Ms Zalazar, the Government states that it is important to note that she has been working from  to the present as a staff member holding various posts of different categories, up until the adoption of provision No. / appointing her a delegate in Buenos Aires. In line with the organizational structure of IPAUSS, the category of delegate forms part of the cabinet staff. This category of official is not covered by the principle of job stability, in line with what is outlined in the previous paragraph. The post in question is of a political nature, with the official expressing opinions on behalf of the State. Therefore, when the official is replaced in the post and ceases to perform the function, he/she automatically returns to his/her regular category, i.e.to his/her permanent position among the regular staff. It is in this situation that MsZalazar currently finds herself, being fully active in the post that corresponds to her length of service and level of promotion, it being emphasized that no obstacles have ever been put in the way of her administrative career, as has been shown.
.The Government states that the administrative acts that are being challenged, which are covered by the abovementioned acts, in no way constitute a violation of freedom of association and do not conceal any attempt to undermine the direct action taken by the union. The Government points out that the direct action lasted for over  days. In regard to the services to be provided to the participants, IPAUSS sent the minutes of a meeting held on  March , in which a Commission for the Audit and Internal Management of IPAUSS was set up through presidency provision No. /. This document deals fundamentally with the unions serious accusation regarding the shortcomings on the part of the companies responsible for providing services under the medical coverage in question, with the agreement to set up a commission for the audit and internal management of IPAUSS.
.Regarding the allegation that the IPAUSS authorities ordered the transfer of workers serving in the Ushuaia and Ro Grande branch to the Buenos Aires branch with a view to undermining the strike being carried out by the workers in the provincial branch, the Government states that by Territorial Act No.  of , the Social Services Institute of the National Territory of Tierra del Fuego, AeIAS (ISST), was established with the main objective of providing medical services to the staff of the Territorys Central Administration and Government; autarchic and/or decentralized entities; territorial legislature; municipalities, retirees and pensioners of the Territorial Social Security Institute, as well as the close family members of the aforementioned categories. Also, Territorial Act No.  of  provided for the establishment of the Territorial Social Security Institute. In , the National Territory of Tierra del Fuego acquired the status of province, and Act No.  of  was passed, establishing IPAUSS. In , Provincial Act No. , through the merging of the two institutes, laid down in its article  the purpose of the institution: the management and administration of the entire retirement pension and social services system covering the staff of the three authorities of the provincial state, its municipalities and town councils, autarchic and decentralized entities and companies with majority state ownership, according to their type, pursuant to article  of Act No. , IPAUSS has its registered office in the provincial capital, Ushuaia, with branches in the city of Ro Grande and the autonomous city of Buenos Aires; and an office in the capital of the Province of Crdoba. It is clear from the foregoing that IPAUSS encompasses a considerable number of participants, both active and retired, many of whom live in different administrative areas of the Republic of Argentina. The total number of participants is in the order of ,, of which , live outside the province.
.The Government points out that the existence of the aforementioned branches and offices, remote from the original headquarters, justifies the secondment of permanent staff for the purpose of handling administrative or social security-related matters, all of which is in the interests of the close relationship that exists between the tasks and responsibilities associated with the coverage and health of those concerned. In the specific case at hand, the transfers that were ordered took place in the context of a particular set of circumstances brought about by direct action on the part of the workers from the Buenos Aires branch. The Government emphasizes that Provincial Act No. , in its articles  and , lays down rules for the assignment of services, whereby officials and employees of the institution are sent on assignment?to carry out specifically assigned tasks. In this particular case, the tasks carried out at the central office in the city of Buenos Aires to which the staff in question were assigned neither discredit them ?as it is argued ?nor turn them into some kind of expatriates, inasmuch as the institutions workforce is a single body. The Government states that the transfers on assignment?were of short duration (no longer than five days) and not large scale, but rather on an alternating basis, the aim being to ensure the continuity and constancy of the Institutes priority functions in the interests of guaranteeing the health service that it has an obligation to provide to its participants.
.The Government concludes by emphasizing that, to avoid falling into anti-trade union conduct, the presidency of IPAUSS made the appropriate administrative approaches to the provinces Undersecretariat of Labour in order to issue a decision as to the lawfulness or otherwise of the direct action being taken, no sanction having thus far been imposed on those having taken part in it. In other words, the free exercise of trade union rights has been respected since the assigned workers belong to the Institutes workforce, and the duration of the assignments is clearly recorded in the acts being challenged. In short, credence cannot be given to any of the points raised in regard to alleged actions running counter to freedom of association; all of the",-1,2007,Argentina
207,"measures taken by the board of directors were taken in the exercise of its duties and within the bounds of the legal framework by which it is governed, with the sole aim of guaranteeing the service, without intimidating the workers participating in the direct action or seeking to undermine the effectiveness of that action.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that the authorities of IPAUSS decided to transfer workers in the service of the Ushuaia and Ro Grande branch, in the Province of Tierra del Fuego, to the Buenos Aires branch in order to undermine the strike being conducted by the latters workers (according to the complainants, the strike had been called in response to systematic irregularities within the Institute, including the removal of the head of the Buenos Aires branch and appointment of staff from outside the institution).
.The Committee notes, in relation to the grounds for the strike, that the Government: ()has sent detailed information explaining the reasons for the decision that Ms Zalazar, who had been appointed delegate and formed part of the cabinet staff, should cease carrying out those duties and return to her regular post within the permanent staff; and ()has reported that the IPAUSS authorities and the representatives of the workers from the Buenos Aires branch came to an agreement on  March  for resolving the conflict, with the establishment of a commission, to include workers?representatives, for the audit and internal management of IPAUSS. The Committee notes with interest that the conflict has been resolved.
.With regard to the alleged transfers of workers in service with the Ushuaia and Ro Grande branch to the Buenos Aires branch with a view to undermining the strike being conducted by the workers of the latter branch, the Committee notes the Government's information that: () the purpose of IPAUSS is the management and administration of the entire retirement pension and social services system covering the staff of the provincial state, its municipalities and town councils, autarchic and decentralized entities and companies with a majority state ownership; () the existence of branches and offices remote from the original headquarters justifies the secondment of staff for the purpose of handling administrative or social security related matters; () the transfers were ordered within the context of a particular set of circumstances brought about by direct action which had lasted for over  days; and () the duration of the transfers did not exceed five days, and they were not large scale but alternating, the aim being to ensure the continuity and constancy of the Institutes priority functions in the interests of guaranteeing the health service that it has an obligation to provide to its participants. In this respect, the Committee is of the view that in the specific circumstances of this case, social security is a service in which it might be necessary to consult with the parties on the establishment of a minimum service, particularly in the event of a lengthy strike, as the Government points out. The Committee recalls that a certain minimum service may be requested in the event of strikes whose scope and duration would cause an acute national crisis, but in this case, the trade union organizations should be able to participate, along with employers and the public authorities, in defining the minimum service [Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. There would thus appear to be no grounds for complaint in regard to the transfers for a short period of time of a small number (ten) of workers to which the complainant organization objects. In these conditions, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,2007,Argentina
208,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Education Workers of Ro Negro (UNTER) and the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) of December .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of December , the UNTER and the CTERA reported that, in , teachers in Ro Negro Province, through their trade union representatives, had called for the introduction of vouchers as part of their basic pay and for equal treatment to other workers (private teachers and other workers employed by a private enterprise) with respect to family allowances. They had also requested a wage review. According to the complainant organization, while the authorities of Ro Negro Province had always recognized the legitimacy of the teachers?claim, they did not acknowledge that the teachers?situation definitely needed to be improved. In September , a four-day work stoppage was held calling for a wage review and, on  October , more than , teachers protested in the city of Cipolletti in Ro Negro Province. The Governor of Ro Negro publicly announced his decision to withhold any action until after the legislative elections on  October. This announcement coincided with the call by the trade union UNTER for an open-ended work stoppage.
.The complainants add that, as the election period had passed without any proposals being made, many trade union leaders began to remind the Governor of the need for dialogue. The Ombudsperson urged the Governor of the Province to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the people of Ro Negro enjoyed the right to education. Furthermore, she invited various sectors of the educational community to participate in round-table discussions or mediation forums that might be held to reach a swift settlement to the dispute with the teachers?union UNTER. The Bishop of Viedma also became involved. Furthermore, the trade union leaders held a meeting with the legislators in an attempt to initiate dialogue.
.The complainants indicate that, while the stoppage was under way, the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Province called on retired teachers to give classes and that a representative of the UNTER requested the Minister for Labour of the Province to refrain from implementing the intended measure of calling on retired teachers to give classes. On November , the teachers of Ro Negro demonstrated in the city of Viedma. After an impressive demonstration involving some , teachers, the Ministry of Labour of the Province ordered compulsory conciliation on  November .
.On  November , the Minister of Labour publicly defended the implementation of wage deductions corresponding to the days of work stoppage. On  November, after the issuance of the compulsory conciliation order, the Governor indicated that sanctions would be imposed on the trade union and on the teachers who did not immediately accept the conciliation process?for failure to fulfil their duty as public officials. When the trade union indicated that it accepted the compulsory conciliation order and ended the industrial action, the Government used deductions as a retaliatory measure against the workers and in order to prevent similar action in the future, advancing pay to teachers without prior reference to the information sheets that are submitted between the th and the last day of each month.
.The complainants indicate that, on  November , the governors and head teachers of educational establishments in the zone of Choele Choel publicly expressed their views, indicating that the wage deduction was not only illegal but was also a form of harassment? It was so indiscriminate that, by way of example, they cited the case of a head teacher who had been on leave at the time of the work stoppage and yet had been subjected to a deduction amounting to  per cent of her salary. This feeling of harassment was criticized at management level in several areas. In some places, head teachers were informed that the deducted money would be reimbursed if they reported the staff members who had participated in the work stoppage in the schools under their charge.
.The complainant organizations state that the direct action taken by the education workers was legitimate and was at no point declared illegal. Nevertheless, the systematic and persistent approach taken by the provincial officials towards the workers?enjoyment of their right to strike involved threatening the workers in an attempt to instil fear into them permanently and pitting them against each other in an attempt to divide the trade union. The non-payment of wages was used as a form of punishment to prevent the enjoyment of the right to petition and the right to strike, both of which are constitutional rights.
.The complainant organizations indicate that article  of Act No.  provides: A compulsory conciliation order implies for parties the immediate cessation of any direct action that may have been organized, restoring the conditions that prevailed the day prior to the initiation of the dispute or the day prior to the events that caused the action.?All sanctions should have been lifted, restoring the conditions that had prevailed the day prior to the start of the dispute. However, the Government decided to implement the deductions without limitation or respect for the situation of the workers. The deductions were applied to all teachers, regardless of whether or not they had worked, been on leave or participated in the stoppage. Article  of the abovementioned Act provides: In any conciliation process brought before this body, the parties are obliged to negotiate in good faith. This involves, among other issues, holding hearings during established times, exchanging whatever information is needed for the most effective analysis of the issues under consideration and making every effort to reach mutually acceptable agreements, without hindering in any way the work of the body or the advancement of the negotiations.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The complainant organizations consider that examination of the described events reveals a serious violation of constitutional rights and furthermore highlights the biased position of the Ministry of Labour, which communicated in the media its decision to proceed to dock the pay of the teachers for exercising their right to strike and their right of petition. The Ministry confirmed its decision to dock pay at the time the compulsory conciliation order was announced. There is no question that these decisions and announcements were made by a body that is part of the employer government. It is clearly unable to retain the impartiality and neutrality which should supposedly be a characteristic of the body responsible for the conciliation process. The Government has not taken any steps to establish an impartial court to settle such collective disputes and has become both judge and party to the case, defending actions that are clearly and blatantly unconstitutional.
.According to the complainants, docking pay for the days of the strike was used as a form of punishment. Just as it is possible to use salaries to reward certain behaviour, in this case they were used to sanction those who exercised the right to petition and to strike and there is only one way to remedy such conduct, and that is to reimburse the deducted sums of money. The situation and reasons behind these deductions and the context in which they were made demonstrate that they were a punishment and that the intention was to punish. This damage is irreparable given that salaries are a source of sustenance. In this case, the perception that wages were docked for days not worked?is unfounded, considering that there are so many examples of teachers who were on sick leave and head teachers who went to work but had their pay docked for not reporting those who had participated in the strike, as well as teachers on a low wage, all of whom had to suffer for a month without receiving any pay at all.
.The complainants emphasize that the administrative authority was liable or at fault for the cause of the claim, as it knows that salaries cannot contain non-remunerative elements, which was one of the demands of the trade union, and that it is unfair under the terms of the National Constitution that education workers should be remunerated in different ways for the same work. The difference in family allowances is clearly marked between workers in public education and those in private education, with teachers in the public sector receiving much lower allowances. The requested redistribution of income is an imperative of social justice and essential for increasing equality. Furthermore, the provincial government is responsible for prolonging the work stoppage, as its decision not to hold talks led to the open-ended work stoppage, which it thought would simply collapse in the course of time. This was the basis of its policy of doing nothing and of the impossibility of dialogue which characterized its conduct.
.The complainant organizations allege that the attitude of the provincial authorities is damaging to the principle of legality and violates the right to collective",5,2006,Argentina
209,"bargaining by ordering as a punishment unlimited wage deductions from the workers who exercised their right to petition and their right to strike as well as from those workers who refused to report their colleagues who participated in the strike.
.In its communication of  October , the Government provided the following account of the events leading up to this case: () the teachers of Ro Negro Province requested the introduction of grocery and/or food vouchers as part of their basic pay and equal treatment to other workers in the private sector in respect of wage improvements; () with respect to the demands of the trade unions and, in the absence of a government response, the organizations in question decided to proceed with the direct action, consisting of a four-day work stoppage; () the Ombudsperson intervened, urging the Governor of the Province to take the necessary measures to ensure that all the people of Ro Negro enjoyed the right to education; () while the work stoppage was under way, the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Province announced that retired teachers were being called on to give classes; () on  November , a demonstration was held in the city of Viedma amid leaks that the provincial authorities would not acknowledge the outstanding wages relating to the work stoppage; () on  November , the Ministry of Labour of the Province issued a compulsory conciliation order; () the trade union indicated that it accepted the issuance of Act No.  on compulsory conciliation and therefore cancelled the direct action that was being taken.
.With regard to the alleged facts, the Government highlights the following: () the complainant organizations proceeded with the direct action, without any type of restriction in that respect from the provincial government, with the exception of the deduction of pay for the days not worked; () subsequent to these measures, a negotiating committee was established and the social partners agreed in the context of a negotiating process that the provincial authorities should acknowledge and/or reimburse any pay that had been deducted for days not worked.
.The Government adds that legislation in a large number of countries provides that all conciliation and mediation processes must be exhausted before a strike can be called. The spirit of these provisions is compatible with Article  of Convention No. , which is aimed at encouraging the full development and utilization of machinery for the voluntary negotiation of collective agreements. Trade union organizations should call for the initiation of negotiations before, rather than after, taking direct action to avoid disrupting the start of the academic year, giving some consideration to the implications of preventing children from attending school.
.The Government reports that, following lengthy negotiations in the context of the joint committee that was established to that effect, preliminary agreements were reached with regard to the views presented by the parties and also with regard to a list of issues to be pursued by the joint members. It is worth pointing out that the joint discussions did not focus solely on the issue of salaries but on a range of issues linked to the educational policy of Ro Negro Province, such as wage policy, the occupational health department, family allowances, the issuance of certificates of service, the presentation of training projects, opportunities for recruitment and promotion, the school calendar and compliance with Act No.  on student tickets. The joint negotiations were held in accordance with the provisions of Convention No. . As a result of the negotiations, the Ministry of Labour of the Province decided to give official status to the agreements that had been reached in a joint accord of  February  and also in joint accords of  February  (on wage policy, the occupational health department, family allowances, certificates of service, training, educational projects and the municipal infrastructure of educational establishments);  April  (on the provision of compensation vouchers, the new Family Allowances Act, municipal maintenance and construction work, school transport in Ro Colorado and teacher mobility); and  December  (on increasing wages by introducing a  dollar bonus, on a non-remunerative basis). Furthermore, it was in this context that resolution No. / was issued, establishing leave of absence for union members standing as candidates in the executive elections of the Union of Education Workers of Ro Negro. The social partners have taken Convention No.  into consideration, in the sense that collective bargaining is the most suitable way of handling differences between disputing parties and that, through such meetings, solutions will be found that will benefit not only those who are directly involved but also society as a whole.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations in the present case state that, after the teachers of Ro Negro Province had carried out a four-day work stoppage and a demonstration involving more than , people in September  calling for a wage review, the administrative authority of the Province issued a compulsory conciliation order on  November  and that, at the time when this administrative measure had been implemented, the provincial government proceeded to dock pay for the days of the work stoppage in an act of reprisal and intimidation.
.First of all, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () the trade union organizations took direct action without any type of restriction, with the exception of the deduction of pay for the days not worked; and () subsequently, a negotiating committee was established between the social partners and it was agreed in the context of a negotiating process that the provincial authorities should acknowledge and/or reimburse any pay that had been deducted for days not worked by the teachers. The Committee notes with interest that the dispute was resolved and that the parties reached agreement on the various issues mentioned by the Government (wage policy, occupational health, family allowances, school transport, etc.).
.Although the dispute has been resolved, the Committee observes that it has recently had to examine various cases relating to Argentinas public sector, involving objections to orders by the provincial authority for compulsory conciliation between the parties to a dispute, when the provincial authority is a party to the dispute. In this respect, once again the Committee reiterates that it is necessary to entrust the decision of initiating the conciliation procedure in collective disputes to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute [see th Report, Case No. , para. ; th Report, Case No. , para. ; th Report, Case No. , para. ; and nd Report, Case No. , para. ] and requests the Government to take measures in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee reiterates that it is necessary to entrust the decision of initiating the conciliation procedure in collective disputes, in particular in the public sector, to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute and requests the Government to take measures in that regard.",3,2006,Argentina

.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations dispute resolution No. -ST dated  April  issued by the Office of the Under-Secretary for Labour of San Juan Province declaring the direct action of the staff of the Social Welfare Fund to be illegal (ordering the cessation of the direct action or the application of appropriate sanctions ?including the removal of trade union status) and resolution No.  of  May  issued by the Social Welfare Fund ordering deductions corresponding to the days of work stoppage from the salaries of employees who participated in the industrial action (according to the complainants, on  April , the Executive Council of ATE San Juan decided on behalf of the workers of the Social Welfare Fund, to carry out a work stoppage with respect to wage claims on ,  and ,  and  April  and the National Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the Director of the Social Welfare Fund were informed of that decision ?the relevant communications are attached to the complaint ?this decision was adopted in the face of the indifference to and lack of interest in providing a response and an opportunity for discussion).
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government: () the complainants did not inform the ministerial office of the San Juan Province of the dispute and therefore did not enter into dialogue and avoided the opportunity to achieve a negotiated settlement with the provincial authorities; () the direct action (work stoppage) was taken without consultation, without warning and without any prior claim by the complainants; () the provincial authorities were entitled to take action in what was an emergency situation caused by sudden action in a body responsible for safeguarding human life, safety and health, (according to the Government, the Social Welfare Fund is involved in designing housing schemes, providing medical and healthcare assistance to pensioners in the province and offering credit, etc., all aimed at a social segment of the population in emergency situations, meaning that a restriction could be placed on the strike); () all the complainants?communications were sent to the national jurisdiction (the Committee understands this to mean national administrative authority), preventing the province from being a necessary party in the dialogue; and () the declaration of the illegality of the work stoppage is valid, as there is no question about whether or not there is an independent body to make such a declaration, by virtue of the fact that the provincial authorities are not recognized as being the employer.
.With regard to the notification of the dispute, the Committee observes from the documentation provided by the complainant organizations, that the dispute had been notified to the Social Welfare Fund (the direct employer of the striking workers) and the regional representative of the National Ministry of Labour itself. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that no national or provincial authority tried to mediate with or conciliate the parties during the five-day strike in question.
.In any case, with regard to the declaration that the stoppage of activities by workers of the Social Welfare Fund was illegal, which subsequently led to the decision of the Fund authorities to dock the workers?salaries for the days of work stoppage, the Committee regrets that it must recall that, on many occasions ?including in connection with a case relating to Argentina [see th Report, Case No. , para. ] ?it has emphasized that the declaration of illegality of actions such as strikes should not be a matter for the Government but for an independent body that enjoys the confidence of both parties. Under these circumstances, the Committee expects that the Government will respect this principle in the future.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets the declaration of illegality of the work stoppage by the workers of the Social Welfare Fund of San Juan Province, on the basis of a decision made by a non-independent body.(b) For this reason, the Committee questions the decision by the Fund authorities to dock the salaries of the workers for the days of work stoppage on the basis of a declaration of illegality by a non-independent organ.(c) The Committee emphasizes that the declaration of illegality of actions such as strikes should not be a matter for the Government but for an independent body that enjoys the confidence of both parties and expects that the Government will respect this principle in the future.",0,2006,Argentina

.In a communication dated  October , the Government sent a copy of a draft decree containing provisions to reject the appeal to a higher administrative authority lodged by the Central of Argentinean Workers (CTA) against Resolution No.  of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security of  July .
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee recalls that, when considering this case at its meeting in June , it noted that, according to the complainant organization, administrative Resolution No. / challenged new articles and  of the statutes with regard to the trade union classification adopted and the scope of membership (in particular, article  allowed both employed and unemployed workers, as well as those receiving social security benefits, to join the CTA and any of the organizations affiliated to it). On that occasion, the Committee recalled that it had, in the past, pronounced itself with regard to similar allegations presented by the CTA in relation to the refusal of the Government to proceed with its trade union registration, based on the fact that it was a third-level trade union body which had certain special characteristics in its structure as regards its representation, whereby provision was made for direct affiliation by individual persons ?including retired and unemployed persons ?contrary to the provisions of the Act on trade union associations [see th Report, Case No. , paras ?]. It also recalled that organizations of employers and workers should have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  and considered that the prohibition of the direct affiliation of certain persons to federations and confederations was contrary to freedom of association principles and that it was for the organizations themselves to determine what the rules relating to their membership should be. In these circumstances, the Committee once again urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the statutes of the CTA are fully approved and to keep it informed in this respect.

222,".The Committee last examined its case at its March  meeting [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, paras ?] and, on that occasion, noting that the documentation the Government had attached to its reply showed that the Provincial Education Council (CPE) of Neuqun province had adopted a new resolution (record No. -/) declaring resolution No.  of  null and void, removing from resolution No.  of  the obligation to inform on those participating in stoppages, and recognizing that the directors of establishments or anyone in charge thereof may, in the context of protest days, freely exercise the right to strike without any sanction whatsoever, the Committee noted with interest the new resolution of the CPE and requested the Government to report on the implementation of the resolution.
.In a communication of  November , the Government states that, first of all, it should be pointed out that the document referred to in the Committees recommendation is not, strictly speaking, a resolution (record No. -/), rather it is a draft resolution prepared by the representatives of the Educational Workers?Association of Neuqun (ATEN) members of the deliberative body of the CPE, which did not receive the number of votes required to become a legal provision. Therefore, the draft resolution attached to the file before this body, and which is referred to in the recommendation, is merely an initiative of the representatives of the trade union, who, in turn, belong to the group presenting the complaint to the ILO. The said draft has not been approved by the aforementioned body, it has not received the majority support of members that is required if a draft resolution is to become a legal provision, neither was it assigned a resolution number nor did it undergo the relevant process of formalization and therefore it does not fulfil the minimum legal requirements.
.The Government states that article  of Act No. / establishes that:The Provincial Education Council shall be composed: (a) of a chairperson and two committee members, one belonging to the primary education branch and another to one of the other branches of education, appointed by the executive authority; (b) of two committee members directly elected by active teaching staff, one of whom shall belong to the primary education branch and another to one of the other branches of education; (c) of a committee member representing the consejeros escolares (education councillors), elected at a joint meeting of all the members of the said councils from among those members by a simple majority.The Government states that, through their representatives, trade union organizations have the opportunity to propose, evaluate, examine and finally decide on educational and management matters brought to their attention. Thus, on  February , the deliberative body, at the suggestion of those of its members representing the trade union organization, addressed the issue in question, but despite doing so, the majority vote necessary to declare resolution No.  of  null and void (removing from resolution No.  of  the obligation to inform on those participating in stoppages, and recognizing that the directors of establishments or anyone in charge thereof may, in the context of protest days, freely exercise the right to strike without any sanction whatsoever) was not achieved. Thus, as the issue in question was not addressed in a way that met with the requirements established by law, this party is able to state that the procedure carried out did not give rise to a valid act of the administration.
.With a view to the Committee issuing another opinion, the Government states that the recommendation it made is based on a provision that, in the eyes of the province, is null and void, and it should be pointed out that, to date, the facts and legislation in place when the complaint lodged by the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) and ATEN was contested have not changed, and resolution No. / is still currently in full force. Furthermore, the Government states that there are administrative proceedings pending regarding non-compliance with resolution No. /. Finally, it should be pointed out that the original reason for establishing resolution No. / was to prioritize the right to work of those workers who do not support industrial action and fundamentally to safeguard the social function of schools within the current economic and socio-cultural context of the province, taking into account the operation of school dinner halls, on which a large proportion of the children in this district depend for food and the consequent need for school directors to keep their schools open in order to provide this service.
.The Committee notes this information, in particular, the fact that the resolution (record No. -/) was merely a draft resolution, which was not approved. The Committee recalls that the complainant organizations had objected to resolutions Nos  of  and  of , adopted by the Provisional Education Council (CPE) of Neuqun province, because they considered that these resolutions prohibit the directors of educational establishments in the province from exercising the right to strike by requiring them to be present at the establishment whenever protest days are taking place, while at the same time requiring them to draw up a list of those members of staff who participate in a stoppage [see th Report, para. ]. The Committee recalls its statement to the effect that While the Committee has found that the education sector does not constitute an essential service, it has held that principals and vice-principals can have their right to strike restricted or even prohibited.?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee also stresses that it has emphasized the fact that essential services or civil service workers deprived of the right to strike should benefit from appropriate guarantees designed to safeguard their interests. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether the workers affected by the resolutions in question can have recourse to conciliation or arbitration procedures that have the confidence of all the parties, in order to protect their interests.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed regarding the judicial procedure under way against resolution No. /, to which it refers in its reply.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Noting that the documentation that the Government attaches to its reply shows that the Provincial Education Council (CPE) of Neuqun province adopted a new resolution (record No. -/) declaring resolution  of  null and void, removing from resolution  of  the obligation to inform on those participating in stoppages, and recognizing that the directors of establishments or anyone in charge thereof may, in the context of protest days, freely exercise the right to strike without any sanction whatsoever (see in annex hereto the full text of the new resolution), the Committee notes with interest the new resolution of the CPE and requests the Government to report on the implementation of the resolution.",3,2005,Argentina
223,".The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in March  [see th Report, paras. -]. The complainants alleged violations of the right to collective bargaining and to strike of education workers in the public sector of the province of Buenos Aires. The Committee expressed the hope that the Government would enact shortly the Decree that was in the process of adoption with a view to implementing the provisions of article  of Act No. , on collective labour disputes, which, in its final paragraph, stipulates that the National Executive, in conjunction with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and after consultation with the employers?and workers?organizations, will enact this article within a period of  days, in accordance with the principles of the International Labour Organization?
.In communications dated  March and  April , the Government reported that on  March , Decree No. / was published, regulating article  of Act No.  on collective labour disputes (the Government encloses a copy of the aforementioned Decree).
.The Committee notes that article  of Decree No.  provides that the committee established under article , paragraph , of Act No.  will be named the Guarantees Commission and pursuant to article  of the Decree will be mandated, inter alia, to ?advise the implementing authority on fixing minimum services, in the event that the parties have not reached an agreement to this effect or that the agreements are insufficient, in order to reconcile the exercise of the right to strike with the other rights recognized by the National Constitution, in accordance with the procedure set out in the present document? The Committee is of the opinion that the new system represents an improvement over the previous one, in that the Guarantees Commission advising the administrative authority includes representatives of workers?and employers?organizations, as well as other independent members. Nevertheless, the final decision on the fixing of minimum services still rests with the administrative authority. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on the practical application of the new provision and specifically, to supply information on the number of cases in which the administrative authority has modified the terms of rulings on minimum services issued by the Guarantees Commission.

224,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras?]. On that occasion it expressed the hope that the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza would issue a ruling in the near future with regard to the proceedings for constitutional protection (amparo) proceedings instituted by the Association of State Workers (ATE) concerning contested Ruling No./, in which the Under-Secretariat of Labour and Social Security of Mendoza province had declared the industrial action (assembly at the workplace) carried out by the workers of Godoy Cruz municipality on June  to be illegal, and also with regard to the alleged penalty of warnings issued to  workers who had participated in the industrial action of  June , which had been declared illegal by the administrative authority of Mendoza province.
.In a communication dated  September , the Government stated that the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza province rejected the appeal for review filed by the union in the case Association of State Workers (ATE) v. the Municipality of Godoy Cruz regarding amparo?
.The Committee notes this information, particularly the points in the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza to the effect that: () the appeal for amparo was lodged after expiry of the applicable deadline ?five months after the industrial action ?and the mayors decision was to issue a warning without any deduction of pay, which did not entail any immediate threat for those penalized; () the party bringing the action appealed and went through the other normal judicial and administrative channels in order to obtain recognition and full protection of the right to freedom of association, which it considers to have been violated; and () as an exceptional means of protection, amparo, in common with the other normal legal remedies, is subject to rules regarding its admissibility, including time limits. The Committee invites the complainant to keep it informed, if it so wishes, of the outcome of any legal action it has taken through ordinary channels in relation to this matter.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting and, on that occasion, emphasizing that a period of almost two years for the issuing of a decision on amparo proceedings (proceedings relating to the protection of constitutional rights) concerning issues relative to trade union rights was too long, had indicated that it expected the judicial authorities to issue a ruling in the near future with regard to the amparo proceedings initiated by the Association of State Workers (ATE) concerning contested ruling No./, in which the Undersecretariat of Labour and Social Security of Mendoza Province had declared the industrial action (assembly at the workplace) carried out by the workers of Godoy Cruz municipality on  June  to be illegal, and also with regard to the alleged sanction of issuing warnings to  workers who had participated in the industrial action of  June , which had been declared illegal by the administrative authority of Mendoza Province [see th Report, paras ?].
.In a communication dated  September , the Government indicated that, on September , the First Labour Chamber of the first judicial district of Mendoza Province had rejected the application for amparo proceedings filed by the trade union in the case Association of State Workers (ATE) versus the municipality of Godoy Cruz regarding amparo? The Government also indicated that the trade union which had filed the application for amparo proceedings had appealed against this ruling, which had been referred to the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza.
.The Committee takes note of this information, expresses the hope that the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza will issue a ruling in the near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision that is handed down in this regard.
.The Government sent its observations in communications of  February and  August .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Emphasizing that a period of almost two years for the issuing of a decision on amparo proceedings concerning issues relative to trade union rights is too long, the Committee expects that the judicial authorities will issue a ruling in the near future with regard to the amparo proceedings initiated by the ATE concerning contested ruling No. /, in which the Undersecretariat of Labour and Social Security of Mendoza Province declared the industrial action (assembly at the workplace) carried out by the workers of Godoy Cruz municipality on  June  to be illegal, as well as the alleged sanction of issuing warnings to  workers who had participated in the industrial action of  June , which was declared illegal by the administrative authority of Mendoza Province. Recalling that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the Government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties concerned, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these amparo proceedings.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the disputed ruling No. / of the Undersecretariat of Labour and Social Security of Mendoza Province according to which the direct action (assembly at the workplace) of  June  by workers of Godoy Cruz municipality was illegal, the Committee recalls that responsibility for declaring illegal an action in support of claims, including strike action and equivalent measures such as permanent assemblies, should not lie with the government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the trade union amparo proceedings initiated by the ATE and currently under examination by the judicial authorities of the Province.(b) As regards the alleged sanction of warnings issued to  workers who had participated in the direct action carried out on  June  and declared illegal by the administrative authority of Mendoza Province, the Committee, noting that the amparo proceedings initiated by the ATE regarding the declaration of illegality also cover this issue, requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of those proceedings.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that in future, if a provincial authority considers it necessary to impose a minimum level of service in refuse collection, which in the specific circumstances of this case cannot be considered essential in the strict sense of the term, it consults the workers?and employers?organizations concerned.(d) As regards the new allegations presented in a communication of May  concerning acts of anti-union discrimination against workers who took part in the direct action carried out in May  in Misiones Province, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.",-1,2004,Argentina
225,".The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting and on that occasion made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:While regretting the significant delay in initiating collective negotiations, the Committee takes due note of the Governments statement that the collective negotiations requested by the UPCN have now begun. The Committee expects that the negotiations will lead to the resolution of the issues at hand in the very near future.As to the cases referred to by the UPCN with regard to which the State had supposedly taken unilateral decisions, which should have been the object of collective bargaining, the Committee trusts that the Government and the UPCN will be able to find a solution to these problems, within the framework of the Standing Committee for Labour Relations envisaged in article  of collective labour agreement No. / of  March .With regard to the allegation related to the possible unilateral decision by the State to introduce a wage increase of  pesos for public sector workers earning less than , pesos, the Committee expects that any decision relative to wage changes in the public sector will be subject to prior consultation with the workers?organizations concerned.
.In its communication of  August , the Government refers to the Committees recommendation in which it stated that it trusted that wage increases in the public sector will be subject to prior consultation with the workers?organizations concerned and had attached Act No.  of  July , which approves the Act of Agreement between representatives of the State and the trade union organizations UPCN and ATE, under which, in the framework of equality of collective bargaining in the public sector, a decision was reached jointly on wage increases for workers in the public administration.
.The Committee notes this information with interest.
.The complaint appears in communications from the National Civil Servants?Union dated  May and  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the UPCN states that, with the approval of Law No.  of , collective bargaining was definitively adopted as the regulatory instrument regarding employer-worker relations within the public sector, in accordance with the terms of international Conventions Nos.  and , as ratified by Argentina. The said Law establishes a wide framework for negotiation, given that it has to cover all labour issues which come under employment relations, including matters related to wages. Article  of the Law envisages collective bargaining, both at a general and a sectoral level, as well as establishing the nature of the bargaining committees.
.The complainant organization states that, based on these legal provisions, the representative trade unions of the sector agreed to negotiate collectively concerning working conditions. This resulted in the signing of a collective labour agreement identified by the Decree recognizing it, No. /, which was only signed by the State as employer and the UPCN. It should be pointed out that, from April , another sectoral representative trade union was included in the agreement, the Association of State Workers (ATE). Despite this, on  January , the UPCN formally requested the Minister of Labour, Employment and Social Security to open collective negotiations at a sectoral level, by virtue of the terms of the first title of the aforementioned public sector Collective Labour Agreement No. / and Law No.  (article ); this request was never processed, and thus, on  March , the same public servant was requested to settle the matter quickly and make an announcement regarding negotiations. The deadline for the announcement regarding negotiations was  May , and the silence on the part of the administration concerning this last request therefore constitutes a refusal on the part of the administration to engage in collective bargaining. The negotiation of the sectoral agreements envisaged in Annex II of Collective Agreement No. / has not taken place, neither have the negotiating committees been integrated, the State employer having adopted an attitude contrary to the terms of the internal and international legal regime.
.The complainant organization alleges that it has repeatedly requested that these sectoral negotiations be opened, as can be seen from the requests made to the Ministry of Labour on  February  and  January  and to the Sub-secretariat of Public Administration in July . No response has been forthcoming from the State as employer. The UPCN believes that the States failure to engage in collective bargaining at the sectoral level, despite repeated requests to that effect, confirms its unwillingness to arrive at an equitable agreement on working conditions in the public sector and that this constitutes a flagrant violation of the principle of good faith which should rule worker-employer relations according to collective labour law. It also contradicts the spirit of negotiations which the ILO Conventions try to reinforce, as well as national standards in force on the issue.
.The UPCN adds that the State as employer has clearly not complied with the legal obligation to enter into a collective bargaining process. The latter has not assumed its reciprocal duties and takes unilateral decisions on issues which should be resolved through collective bargaining, violating constitutional principles and standards and resulting in damage to the very nature of public employment and, consequently, to those employees represented by the UPCN. More specifically, the complainant organization refers to the following cases in which unilateral decisions were taken by the authorities regarding issues which should have been resolved through a process of collective bargaining:?resolution SSGP No. /. Published in Official Bulletin No.  of  November , modifying resolution SSGP No. /, unilaterally establishes the composition of a consultation committee for the national training system, in violation of the rules on proportional representation set out under article  of Law No.  and Chapter X of Law No. , which creates the Standing Fund for Training and Labour Re-qualification. The latter has, so far, not begun its work. The decision was formally contested on  December ;?draft General Regulation on recruitment in posts included within the executive hierarchical scale, submitted by the Sub-secretariat of Public Administration, is also aimed at unilaterally dealing with issues which pertain to collective bargaining, in clear violation of the procedure for recruitment in key posts within the National Administrative Profession System (SINAPA). This draft Regulation was contested on  December ;?the National Institute of Agricultural and Livestock Technology (INTA): this body carried out the selection of candidates for executive posts, without involving the UPCN as monitor, ultimately refusing to recognize the primacy of the collective agreement. This case was taken before the Standing Committee for Labour Relations (COPAR) (envisaged in article  of Collective Labour Agreement No. / of  December );?National Parks Administration: Resolution No. / contravened the rights confirmed in the Collective Labour Agreement, in attempting to incorporate changes to the personnel entry and selection mechanisms concerning the corps of national park guards, a process involving altering the rights and duties established in the hierarchical scale which has been approved through Decree PEN No. /. This issue should clearly be dealt with through collective bargaining and cannot be decided on unilaterally by the State as employer. This case was denounced before COPAR on  November ; and?resolution SSGP No. / and Decree No. / which are in violation of the trade union representativity regime envisaged in article  of Law No.  and Decree No. /, unilaterally incorporating a trade union organization into the scope of negotiations without that organization having signed the respective collective agreement. The UPCN states that it requested that the regulation in question be revoked.
.Finally, the complainant organization states that the State as employer recently announced, at a press conference to the representatives of the mass media, that public workers being paid less than  pesos would supposedly benefit from a wage increase of up to  pesos (the National Executive has still not published any provision regulating or giving force of law to this decision). This is a clear breach of the collective bargaining process, given that at the same time that this unilateral announcement was being made (without prior consultation), the UPCN was in close contact with certain sectors of the Government, with a view to reaching an agreement on the adjustment of the wages of workers in the sector concerned. It should not be forgotten that, in Argentina, negotiations regarding public workers?hierarchical scale and wages fall within the ambit of collective bargaining and these subjects can only be modified through such a process. More concretely, the State as employer was attempting to unilaterally resolve an issue which required agreement on both sides for its settlement.
.In its communication dated  June , the UPCN states that, on  June , it yet again formally requested, this time through",-1,2004,Argentina
226,"an individual request for each sector, to order a convocation for the setting up of the bargaining committees of the sectoral collective agreements for the different hierarchical scales included in the general Collective Agreement for the national public administration No. /. This request, based on articles ,  and  of Decree No. /, regulating articles  and  of Law No. , constitutes the last possible recourse before all the avenues concerning the administrative standards and joint bodies of Argentina have been exhausted. The UPCN adds that, in accordance with the aforementioned standard, the State is obliged to enter into negotiations within  days of the presentation of all the necessary legal instruments to this effect. This legal deadline would unfailingly expire on  July .
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states, in relation to the complaint, that it has not violated Conventions Nos.  and . The Government emphasizes that, in accordance with article  of Law No. , it is the political authorities representing the State that have sole authority when it comes to convoking collective bargaining procedures, having to comply with the procedural safeguards laid down in legislation. The Government adds that, without prejudice to what has already been stated, the question is no longer relevant, given that the negotiations in question have already begun.
.The Government states that meanwhile, and with regard to the non-compliance on behalf of the State as employer mentioned by the complainant organization, it is appropriate to consider the following:(i) on  November , the Sub-secretariat of Public Administration, acting within its competence, issued resolution No. / which was published in the Official Bulletin on  November  and refers to the establishment of a consultation committee for the national training system. The UPCN appealed against the aforementioned resolution on  December , and this led to the issuing of legal opinion No. / of  December  and its immediate referral to the Legal and Technical Secretariat of the Presidential Office of the Nation for processing by that body in its capacity as the standing legal service of the Sub-secretariat. An appeal lodged by the UPCN is currently being considered;(ii) with reference to the questions regarding the draft general regulation concerning recruitment in posts included in the executive hierarchical scale, it should be pointed out that the regulation only dealt with labour matters; it should also be pointed out that a draft regulation cannot be contested, neither can related preparatory acts, reports, legal opinions and any other action which, in itself, is not sufficient to give rise to an immediate legal effect with regard to the issue; these acts cannot be contested through administrative or legal channels even though they may suffer from a legal flaw;(iii) with respect to the situation regarding the National Institute of Agricultural and Livestock Technology (INTA), the Government affirms that a representation was made before the Standing Committee for Labour Relations (COPAR), but the State as employer stated that the relevant study and consultations had been initiated, requesting the trade union organization to grant it more time in which to determine its position. The trade union acceded to this request and it was agreed that the issue would be dealt with at the next meeting of the COPAR; and(iv) as to the situation concerning the National Parks Administration, the trade unions and the Sub-secretariat of Public Administration signed an Act on  May  and a joint resolution was then issued concerning, among other things, the selection process for auxiliary park guards.
.The Government adds that without prejudice to what has already been said, during the meeting of the COPAR held on  March , the UPCN demonstrated its willingness to alter its position so that the issues at hand be better dealt with.
.As to the allegation of UPCN which calls into question both Decree No. / and resolution SSGP No. /, through which members can be integrated in the Standing Careers Committee, the Government states that there is no legal obstacle preventing the National Executive, as a part of the powers conferred upon it, from including a monitor from the Association of State Workers (ATE) in the relevant bodies.
.The Committee observes that, in the case in question, the National Civil Servants?Union (UPCN) alleges that the State refused to enter into the collective bargaining process at a sectoral level as requested by the complainant organization since February , despite the fact that, under national legislation, labour relations in the public sector, both at a general and sectoral level, should be regulated through collective bargaining. The complainant organization adds that the State has been taking unilateral decisions regarding issues which pertain to collective bargaining and gives examples of decisions which had been adopted on issues which, in its view, should have been the object of collective bargaining.
.Firstly, while regretting the significant delay in initiating the collective negotiations the Committee observes that the Government states that the collective negotiations requested by the UPCN have now begun. The Committee expects that the negotiations will lead to the resolution of the issues at hand in the very near future.
.As to the cases referred to by the UPCN with regard to which the State had supposedly taken unilateral decisions which should have been the object of collective bargaining (more specifically, with regard to resolution SSGP No. / which establishes the composition of a consultation committee for the national training system; the draft General Regulation on recruitment in posts included within the executive hierarchical scale; the selection procedure for executive posts at the National Institute of Agricultural and Livestock Technology (INTA); and changes to the personnel entry and selection mechanisms concerning the corps of national park guards), the Committee observes that the Government states that during the meeting of the Standing Committee for Labour Relations envisaged in article  of collective labour agreement No. / of  March , the UPCN demonstrated its willingness to alter its position so that the issues at hand be better dealt with. In this respect, the Committee trusts that the Government and the UPCN will be able to find a solution to these problems.
.As to resolution SSGP No. / and Decree No. / through which, according to the UPCN, a trade union organization which had not signed the respective collective agreement was unilaterally incorporated into negotiations, the Committee observes that the Government states that there is no legal obstacle preventing the National Executive, as a part of the powers conferred upon it, from including a monitor from the Association of State Workers (ATE) in the relevant bodies. The Committee also observes that the complainant organization has not specified that the aforementioned organization is not representative.
.Finally, with regard to the allegation related to the possible unilateral decision of the State to introduce a wage increase of  pesos for public sector workers earning less than , pesos, the Committee observes that the Government has not sent its observations on this matter. The Committee expects that any decisions relative to wage changes in the public sector will be subject to prior consultation with the workers?organizations concerned. The Committee recalls that Article  of Convention No.  provides that measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for negotiation of terms and conditions of employment between the public authorities concerned and public employees?organizations, or of such other methods as will allow representatives of public employees to participate in the determination of these matters.
.In light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While regretting the significant delay in initiating collective negotiations, the Committee takes due note of the Governments statement that the collective negotiations requested by the UPCN have now begun. The Committee expects that the negotiations will lead to the resolution of the issues at hand in the very near future.(b) As to the cases referred to by the UPCN with regard to which the State had supposedly taken unilateral decisions, which should have been the object of collective bargaining, the Committee trusts that the Government and the UPCN will be able to find a solution to these problems, within the framework of the Standing Committee for Labour Relations envisaged in article  of collective labour agreement No. / of  March .(c) With regard to the allegation related to the possible unilateral decision by the State to introduce a wage increase of  pesos for public sector workers earning less than , pesos, the Committee expects that any decision relative to wage changes in the public sector will be subject to prior consultation with the workers?organizations concerned.",-1,2004,Argentina

.In its communication of  June , the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Association of State Workers (ATE) objected to the decision of the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires to impose a compulsory conciliation procedure in the context of a collective dispute and the approval of this procedure by the National Ministry of Labour.
.The complainants indicate that article bis of the Constitution of Argentina guarantees trade unions the right to strike as a fundamental right. The Province of Buenos Aires quoted the Constituent Convention of  with respect to the reform of the Provincial Constitution which, inter alia, sanctioned section  stating that work is a right and a social duty: The Province recognizes the right to organize and the right of freedom of association, collective agreements, the right to strike and the guarantees of immunity for trade union representatives?and the Province guarantees public employees the right to negotiate their conditions of work and the settlement of collective disputes between the Province and public employees through an impartial body determined by law. Any act or contract which contravenes the guarantees recognized in the present subsection shall be deemed null and void.
.The complainant organizations allege that, despite the provisions relating to formal protection of the right to strike, the Province of Buenos Aires, via its Undersecretary for Labour, summoned the abovementioned primary trade unions to compulsory conciliation, thus directly curtailing the right to strike, with the Undersecretary in the role of conciliator between the parties to the dispute, despite being an official of the provincial government, which is one of the parties to the dispute. The complainants indicate that Decision No.  states as follows:In view of the dispute between the provincial executive authority of the central public administration and self-governing entities within its ambit and the employees thereof represented by the officially established representative trade union organizations of the sector and whereas: ?The Undersecretary for Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires resolves: Article : To investigate the situation defined as a collective labour dispute by opening the compulsory conciliation procedure between the provincial executive authority of the central public administration and self-governing entities within its ambit and the employees thereof represented by the officially established representative trade unions ?

.According to the complainants, the abovementioned decision of the Undersecretary for Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires prescribed compulsory conciliation with respect to the pay claim submitted by the complainant organizations. The complainants consider that if the state employer itself can prescribe as it sees fit the suspension of legitimate measures of direct action available to its dependent workers, the exercise of trade union rights, particularly the right to strike, becomes impossible in practice.
.The complainants state that tension arose in the Province of Buenos Aires from the claim for a wage increase, which had been frozen for nearly ten years, from May , as a direct consequence of the national Governments decision to award a pay increase to its employees. The complainants point out that, from the start of the dispute until the unlawful call for compulsory conciliation, the parties to the dispute held specific talks on the issue in which the provincial government proposed guidelines for wage increases. These guidelines were rejected by all participants in the negotiations and for this reason alone compulsory conciliation was imposed on the parties, in clear violation of ILO standards.
.The complainants state that the trade union rejected the call to compulsory conciliation and expressed a series of objections. None of these was taken into account; on the contrary, the Province, committing further procedural irregularities, issued a new writ on  June, with a very short deadline, containing the threat of financial penalties, clearly seeking to obstruct the complainants?legitimate right of defence.
.Finally, the complainants emphasize that, without resolving the substance of any of the submissions made, the Province of Buenos Aires evaded the proper jurisdiction for settling the dispute and took the matter to the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. The National Ministry of Labour acknowledged the Provinces action and issued Decision No. , which ends as follows: ?The Association of State Workers, the Single Union of Education Workers and the Federation of Education Workers of Buenos Aires are hereby required to comply with the rulings of the provincial labour authority having competence in the dispute with the Government of the Province of Buenos Aires, with due regard for the provisions of Act No.  on trade unions.?According to the complainants, this pronouncement is riddled with errors purely from the legal point of view. Despite the fact that it is not a judicial body, the National Ministry of Labour is concerning itself with constitutional matters. Even more serious is the fact that it is thereby interfering in the internal affairs of a federal State, the Province of Buenos Aires. Moreover, without having any authority to do so, it is determining the competence of the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires, even though this arrogated authority expressly violates local constitutional provisions, at the same time violating the Constitution of the Nation, inasmuch as article () thereof acknowledges ILO Conventions Nos.  and .
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that it is important to remember that launching a conciliation procedure allows the administrative authority to mediate between the conflicting interests and positions, helping to find a peaceful solution to the dispute, with the key contribution being made by the parties concerned. In addition, the conciliation procedure provides a forum for taking stock and bridging differences, with the parties themselves exercising their autonomy and making reciprocal concessions, thereby reaching an agreement which in principle settles the underlying differences. A procedure of this kind should not entail submission to measures which restrict the freedom of negotiation of the parties involved.
.The Government adds that in Decision No. /, to which the complainant organizations objected, the nature of the activity affected was assessed, the situation was defined as a collective dispute and consequently compulsory conciliation was prescribed, applying the principles of procedural immediacy and appropriateness, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III of Act No. . Subjecting the exercise of the right to strike to a time limit cannot be faulted where the duration of the compulsory conciliation process is reasonable and does not entail de facto neutralization of established guarantees. Consequently, the Undersecretariat of the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires, in accordance with section  of Act No.  and given the lack of any agreement or solution in the dispute between the provincial executive authority and its employees and within its own competence, ordered that the dispute should be subjected to compulsory conciliation for the purpose of reaching a peaceful agreement on the issue.
.The Government states that it should be emphasized that the intervention by the Undersecretariat was extended by the period stipulated in section  of Act No. , i.e.  days. Indeed, the Association of State Workers (ATE) was notified of Decision No. / of  June  ordering the opening of compulsory conciliation proceedings. Moreover, the dispute in question came to an end with the acceptance of the offer from the provincial executive authority on  July , as can be seen from memo No.  sent to the Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires signed by the ATE General Secretary. The Government adds that the conciliation procedure in question is not definitive, nor is it the context in which substantive decisions are taken; as stated above, it is merely a channel of negotiation in which social peace ?temporarily ?prevails. In other words, it was compulsory for the trade unions to participate in the conciliation procedure (which took place over an extremely limited period of time, as already stated), but they were in no way obliged to accept any proposed solution.
.As regards the intervention by the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security to which the complainants objected, the Government indicates that on  June  the Ministry issued Decision No. / requiring the ATE to comply with the provisions laid down by the competent provincial labour authority in the dispute with the Government of the Province of Buenos Aires, in accordance with the provisions of Act No. . The fourth whereas of the above Decision is",0,2004,Argentina
228,"particularly important inasmuch as it states:Whereas in these circumstances it should be noted that this Ministerial Office has recognized in Agreement No.  of  September  between the National Labour Secretariat and the Labour Secretariat of the Province of Buenos Aires that, in accordance with the regulations in force of the Constitution of the Nation and the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires, the National and Provincial Ministries?Acts and Act No.  ratifying the Federal Labour Pact and its provincial equivalent No. , the Government of the Province of Buenos Aires, via its Labour Secretariat, is competent not only to negotiate collectively with the trade union representatives of its own public employees and conclude the relevant collective labour agreements but also to hear and intervene in any labour disputes which arise in its territory.According to the Government, it is therefore erroneous to maintain that the National Ministry of Labour is not competent to intervene in the dispute, inasmuch as its participation abides strictly by the provisions of Act No. , for which the National Ministry of Labour is the implementing authority.
.Finally, the Government indicates that the complainants?request that anti-union?action should be ordered to cease and that the summons to compulsory conciliation issued by the executive authority of the Province of Buenos Aires should be declared null and void, becomes academic since, as stated above, the dispute in question came to an end with the offer proposed by the provincial executive authority on  July  being accepted by the trade unions, thereby fully validating the role played by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations in the present case allege that in the context of a pay claim, there has been a violation of the right to strike of state employees of the Province of Buenos Aires, guaranteed in the National Constitution and in the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires. Specifically, the complainant organizations object to: () Decision No. / of  June , whereby the Undersecretary for Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires ordered the opening of a compulsory conciliation procedure between the provincial executive authority of the central public administration and the employees thereof represented by the trade unions, and instructed the trade unions to refrain from adopting any measure that might directly or indirectly modify the functioning and/or provision of services under their responsibility and to revert to the normal and habitual performance of their duties for the period of the compulsory conciliation procedure; and () Decision No. / of the National Ministry of Labour, instructing, to the same effect as Decision No. /, the Association of State Workers (ATE), the Single Union of Education Workers and the Federation of Education Workers of Buenos Aires to comply with the rulings of the provincial labour authority having competence in the dispute with the Government of the Province of Buenos Aires.
.The Committee notes that the Government indicates that: () given the lack of any agreement or solution in the dispute between the provincial executive authority and its employees and within that authoritys competence, it was ordered that the dispute should be subjected to compulsory conciliation for the purpose of reaching a peaceful agreement on the issue; () the conciliation procedure objected to does not make decisions on substantive matters but is merely a channel of negotiation in which social peace temporarily prevails; () the conciliation procedure was extended for the period specified in law ?i.e.  days ?and, although it was compulsory for the trade unions to participate in the conciliation procedure, they were in no way obliged to accept any solution proposed therein; () the intervention by the National Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security through Decision No. / abides strictly by the provisions of Act No.  on trade unions; and () the dispute in question was resolved with the acceptance by the trade unions of the offer made by the provincial executive authority on  July .
.In this respect the Committee notes with satisfaction that the complainant organizations and the authorities of the Province of Buenos Aires reached an agreement which put an end to the dispute in question.
.The Committee observes that the present case concerns the public administration of a province and that the decision to open the conciliation procedure was adopted by the Undersecretary for Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires. The Committee recalls that legislation which provides for voluntary conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before a strike may be called cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association, provided recourse to arbitration is not compulsory and does not, in practice, prevent the calling of the strike?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , th edition, para. ]. In these particular circumstances, the Committee emphasizes that it would be desirable to entrust the decision of opening the conciliation procedure to an organ which is independent of the parties to the dispute and requests the Government to bring its law and practice into line with Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee draws the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) In the particular circumstances of this case, the Committee emphasizes that it would be desirable to entrust the decision of opening the conciliation procedure to an organ which is independent of the parties to the dispute and requests the Government to bring its law and practice into line with Conventions Nos.  and .(b) The Committee draws the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",0,2004,Argentina
229,".The Committee last examined this case relating to alleged acts of anti-union harassment of the complainant organizations assistant secretary at its meeting in June  [see nd Report, paras ?]. On that occasion the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the extraordinary appeal before the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the lifting of trade union privileges and authorization for dismissal of the trade union official, Praino Ral (in second instance, the Appeals Court upheld the ruling of the Court of First Instance rejecting the request for the lifting of his trade union privileges filed by the National Institute of Social Services).
.In a communication dated  October , the Government informs the Committee that the judicial authority has ruled that the extraordinary appeal has lapsed (in the absence of any further developments in the proceedings) and that the case is therefore closed.
.The Committee notes this information.
.The Committee last examined this case relating to alleged acts of anti-union harassment of the complainant organizations assistant secretary at its meeting in November  [see th Report, paras. -], when it made the following recommendation:The Committee recalls that no person should be discriminated against in his or her employment as a result of his or her legitimate trade union activities or membership, whether present or past. The Committee notes this information and, in particular, that the judicial authority of the second instance upheld the decision that rejected the request for the lifting of trade union privileges and authorization for dismissal filed by the National Institute of Social Services for Persons Receiving Retirement Benefits and Pensions against the trade union official Praino Ral. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of. the outcome of the extraordinary appeal filed in relation to the judicial decision of the Court of Second Instance.
.In a communication dated  November , the Government refers to events connected with this case that have already been examined by the Committee. In a communication dated  February , the Government states that the States appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice, which sought the annulment of the decision of the Appeals Court that upheld the ruling of the Court of First Instance rejecting the request for the lifting of trade union privileges filed by the National Institute of Social Services, has not yet been ruled upon. The Government also undertakes to inform the Committee of any new developments in this matter.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the extraordinary appeal now before the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the lifting of trade union privileges and authorization for dismissal of the trade union official, Praino Ral.
.The Committee examined this case relating to acts of anti-union discrimination against the complainant organizations assistant secretary at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion it made the following recommendation:Observing that: () the judicial authority rejected the National Institute of Social Services for Persons Receiving Retirement Benefits and Pensions?application for the lifting of trade union protection and the authorization of dismissal against trade union official Mr. Praino, in particular noting in the judgment acts demonstrating anti-union intentions on the part of the aforementioned Institute; and () the fact that the Institute appealed against the said ruling, the Committee requests the Government to forward a copy of the decision regarding the appeal as soon as it is rendered.
.In a communication dated  June , the complainant organization, the National Coordination of State Workers (CONATE) refers to the lawsuit National Institute of Social Services for Persons Receiving Retirement Benefits and Pensions v Praino Ral, Lifting of Trade Union Protection?currently before the Federal Court of the Republic of Argentina, and states that the decision of the Court of Second Instance confirms that of the Federal Court of First Instance which decided in favour of Ral Praina, noting anti-union discrimination and treatment against the assistant secretary of CONATE. The complainant organization states that, with the decision by the Court of Appeal not only to uphold the decision to reject the withdrawal of trade union privileges and subsequent dismissal of Mr. Praino, but also to uphold the reasons on which this decision was based, it is imperative that the Committee express an opinion on the matter, calling attention to the anti-union conduct shown, and urge the Argentinean Government to take steps to prevent such conduct occurring in situations similar to those that gave rise to the complaint.
.In communications dated  July and October , the Government states that it has been informed that the decision of the Second Instance of the Federal Court of Appeal of the City of Rosario ?Province of Santa Fe ?upheld the decision of the Court of First Instance and that the plaintiff has filed the appropriate extraordinary appeal.
.The Committee recalls that no person should be discriminated against in his or her employment as a result of his or her legitimate trade union activities or membership, whether present or past. The Committee notes this information and, in particular, that the judicial authority of the second instance upheld the decision that rejected the request for the lifting of trade union privileges and authorization for dismissal filed by the National Institute of Social Services for Persons Receiving Retirement Benefits and Pensions against the trade union official Praino Ral. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of. the outcome of the extraordinary appeal filed in relation to the judicial decision of the Court of Second Instance.
.The complaint appears in a communication from the National Coordination of State Workers (CONATE), dated May .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October and  December .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated May , the National Coordination of State Workers (CONATE) states that it is a second-grade trade union organization, made up of various trade unions, collectively known as the New State Workers?Organization (NORTE), each of which is based in their own province or municipality.
.The complainant organization alleges anti-union discrimination against its deputy secretary, Mr. Ral Blas Praino, on the part of the authorities of the National Institute of Social Services for Persons Receiving Retirement Benefits and Pensions (INSSJP), for which he has worked since , having worked as a heating engineer for the General Services Office of the Administrative Division of the PAMI  Clinic. The complainant organization alleges that the INSSJP filed a legal application with the aim of lifting the trade union protection of Mr. Ral Blas Praino and obtaining authorization for his dismissal (the complainant organization states that Argentine law establishes that when a worker is a trade union official and for up to a year after the end of his/her mandate, he/she enjoys legal protection against dismissal during that period, unless just cause?can be demonstrated in terms of labour law). The complainant organization states that Mr. Praino has been accused of having violated his duty of trust towards the INSSJP, when in reality he was on trade union leave, during which time he was working for an inspection committee representing the trade union organization known as the Association of State Workers (ATE), at the request of the latter, a request which was granted by his employer, the INSSJP.
.The complainant organization believes that it is clear that the allegations contained in this complaint are not merely a series of casual and circumstantial events but represent a process marked by hostility and discrimination, aimed at a trade union official owing to his ideological beliefs and trade union activities, which has no legal basis whatsoever and which was carried out with complete disregard for all the political and legal parameters that go to make up a republic and the rule of law. The official in question cannot possibly be dismissed on grounds of a fictive just cause, as he was on trade union leave, representing the trade union in the post conferred upon him by said body, with the consent of his employer, the INSSJP, which just so happens to answer to the Government. It is also clear to the complainant organization that the discrimination aimed at Mr. Praino is also aimed at CONATE, of which he is deputy secretary. According to CONATE, the attempt to discourage Mr. Praino in his trade union activities is disrupting the very running of the trade union organization.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that the complaint is based on the alleged dismissal from the INSSJP of Mr. Ral Blas Praino, regardless of his trade union rights. The Government further states that trade union rights consist of specific protection for trade union officials from acts of discrimination and this is regulated by articles ,  and related provisions of Law No. . This legislation guarantees workers?representatives a secure job and establishes that dismissal can only take place",2,2004,Argentina
230,"if just cause?is demonstrated and, even then, a legal ruling must be handed down, taking this protection away from the worker in question (withdrawal of immunity proceedings).
.The Government adds that, following consultation with the INSSJP concerning the allegations, it has the following to report: () the INSSJP recognizes the existence of trade union immunity in the case of Ral Praino and proceeded to request the competent judge to issue an exemption of this guarantee as established under the abovementioned article  of Law No. ; () this legal request was made with the aim of dismissing Mr. Praino with just cause and this dismissal is subject to the result of the withdrawal of immunity proceedings; () the reasons for requesting the withdrawal of Mr. Prainos immunity and proceeding to his dismissal are given by the INSSJP in the request for the lifting of trade union protection (more specifically, Mr. Praino stands accused of having participated in the conclusion and implementation of a contract, signed on  October , which was prejudicial to the INSSJPs interests. These reasons constitute irregularities in the conclusion of a contract and are in no way connected to any possible trade union activity on the part of Mr. Praino); and () the lifting of guarantees (trade union protection), envisaged under article  of Law No. , in the case of Mr. Praino and his dismissal is subject to the ruling to be issued as a consequence of the ongoing withdrawal of immunity proceedings.
.The Government states that, given the facts of the case, there has been no violation of freedom of association whatsoever, since Argentine law provides protection which ensures that trade union representatives may not be suspended or dismissed because of their trade union activities.
.In its communication dated  December , the Government sends a copy of the ruling handed down by the federal judge of Federal Court No.  of the City of Rosario, concerning Case No.  entitled National Institute of Social Services for Persons Receiving Retirement Benefits and Pensions v. Praino, Ral, Lifting of Trade Union Protection, in which the court rejects the application for the lifting of trade union protection in relation to Ral Blas Praino. Likewise, the Government states that this ruling is currently under review by the Supreme Court after an appeal filed by the PAMI Clinic, in accordance with Argentine law.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges anti-union discrimination against its deputy secretary, Mr. Ral Blas Praino, perpetrated by the INSSJP, for which he has worked since , which filed a legal request with the aim of obtaining the lifting of trade union protection in the case of Mr. Praino and authorization for his dismissal (according to the complainant organization, Mr. Praino stands accused of having committed acts that he could not possibly have committed, given that he was on trade union leave and working for an inspection committee, a post designated to him by the INSSJP and the trade union organization, ATE).
.The Committee observes that the Government attaches a copy of the request submitted by the INSSJP to the courts, in which it requests that immunity withdrawal proceedings be instigated concerning Mr. Praino, in order to proceed to his dismissal, as a part of which the trade union official in question is accused of having participated in the conclusion and implementation of a contract, signed in , which was prejudicial to the interests of the INSSJP.
.Likewise, the Committee observes that the Government sent a copy of the ruling handed down by the judicial authority of the first instance in which the judicial action regarding trade union protection brought by the INSSJP against Mr. Ral Blas Praino was rejected. The Committee observes that, in the considerations of its ruling, the judicial authority states that: () ?the lack of attention to detail of the applicants (INSSJP) approach regarding the matter in question cannot be ignored, ? () ?inevitably, one question arises: either such a lack of detail is the product of a lack of technical legal knowledge on the part of the Institutes management with regard to issues requiring special attention and dedication, and these issues did not receive such treatment or, and this is the crux of the matter, discriminatory behaviour aimed at various trade union representatives, consisting in unequal treatment in similar objective situations, ? () The response to the previous question lies in the study of the following points: the general nature of the accusations made against Mr. Praino and the lack of detail provided regarding these accusations; the lack of any proof (article  of the National Civil and Commercial Procedure (CPCCN) having been strictly applied); the contradictory decisions adopted; the chronological disparity between the events and the dismissals (five years); the incongruity of informing the court of Mr. Prainos suspension, then immediately requesting that he be suspended and then informing the court that he was carrying out his duties as normal; the unequal nature of the approach adopted in objectively similar situations, referred to previously, amongst others? and () The proof submitted so far is insufficient in this case and the different steps taken by the Institute, which will prove to be extremely costly in financial terms for the Institute, demonstrate inappropriate, inconsistent behaviour and unequal treatment of workers who find themselves in what are, basically, identical situations, and which, thus, displays the anti-union intentions that the Institute is attempting to carry out by legal means?
.In these circumstances, observing that: () the judicial authority rejected the INSSJPs application regarding trade union official, Mr. Praino, in particular noting in the judgement acts demonstrating anti-union intentions on the part of the aforementioned Institute; and () the fact that the Institute appealed against the said ruling, the Committee requests the Government to forward a copy of the decision regarding the appeal as soon as it is rendered.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Observing that: () the judicial authority rejected the INSSJPs application for the lifting of trade union protection and the authorization of dismissal against trade union official Mr. Praino, in particular noting in the judgement acts demonstrating anti-union intentions on the part of the aforementioned Institute; and () the fact that the Institute appealed against the said ruling, the Committee requests the Government to forward a copy of the decision regarding the appeal as soon as it is rendered.",2,2004,Argentina
231,".The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Given that, under the terms of section  of the Act respecting trade unions, the most representative trade union organization at the enterprise level ?the Lockheed Aircraft Argentina S.A. Workers?Union (SITLA) ?does not enjoy, inter alia, the right to collective bargaining because there is already a branch union at the workplace with official status, the Committee considers that this provision is not consistent with Article  of Convention No. , and requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the provision in question.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that SITLA can freely exercise the rights enshrined in the freedom of association and collective bargaining Conventions (Nos.  and ), ratified by Argentina.(c) The Committee notes that the legislative provision in this case has already been commented upon by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",4,2003,Argentina
232,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting and on that occasion requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the proceedings and the amparo application concerning the leaders of the Trade Union of Puntanos?Judicial Employees (SIJUPU), and to send its observations regarding the alleged lack of participation of the SIJUPU in the organization of the Judicial Training Institute [see thReport, paras ?].
.In a communication of March , the Government sent the reply of the High Court of Justice of San Luis Province, which stated that its labour policy has been borne out by the fact that, following the election of a new executive committee of the SIJUPU, there have been certain positive developments following a reciprocal proposal for dialogue, referred to by both parties ?the union and the High Court of Justice ?as the Dialogue Committee? The objective of the Committee, whose members are two ministers and trade union representatives, is to seek peaceful alternatives through dialogue, coordination of efforts, strengthening of projects and a search for solutions for all judicial employees? In that spirit, as reflected in the certified copy of the presentation made to the High Court of Justice by the SIJUPU, it has been possible to implement the following measures: reactivation of the judicial career path? changing the term length of service?to judicial status? to be acquired automatically upon promotion? attendance bonus? university degree bonus? higher education bonus? allowance for differently abled staff? limit on hours of service to the public during judicial vacation fixed at two hours less (from  a.m. to  p.m.)? and transfer of judicial employees to other departments at their request?
.In addition, it should be pointed out that the Dialogue Committee?was instrumental in enabling the peaceful, reasonable and gradual implementation of the demands put forward by the SIJUPU. The High Court of Justice adds that, in view of the above, and of the SIJUPUs endorsement of the manner in which the proposals made over the years have been handled and gradually resolved (a communication from the SIJUPU referring to the progress achieved as a result of the Dialogue Committee?is enclosed with the reply), Case No.  should be closed.
.The Committee notes this information with satisfaction.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see rd Report, paras?] and on that occasion it expressed the expectation that the appeals relating to the administrative proceedings against members of the SIJUPU executive committee and the amparo (protection of constitutional rights) application relating to the dismissal of the SIJUPU General Secretary would be settled in the very near future and requested the Government to keep it informed in that regard and to send its observations on the alleged lack of participation of SIJUPU in the organization of the Judicial Training Institute.
.In its communication of  October , SIJUPU alleges that: () it faces discrimination in that it is prevented from putting posters or announcements on the walls at the entrance to the courthouse, while the Bar Association is allowed to do so; () the administrative proceedings and the amparo application mentioned in the original complaint have not yet been settled; () SIJUPU requested a pay review and, in the absence of a response, it called a strike from  June  and the striking workers had wages deducted for nine strike days to dissuade them from exercising their constitutional right to strike; and () a  per cent pay increase was finally agreed upon, but at the time of the complaint the workers had still not received it.
.In its communication of  June , the Government indicates that, according to the relevant information that was gathered, the High Court of San Luis:?categorically denies the allegation concerning the ban on assembly and on putting up posters and indicates that the union was simply told to do these things in the places that are specifically designated for union communications. In this regard, the Court states that it has taken into consideration the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), Part III, Articles  and , in relation to the facilities to be afforded to public employees?organizations;?categorically denies the existence of irregularities (to which the complainant refers only in general terms, without identifying the specific offence) in the administrative proceedings. The Court reports that: (i) the proceedings Dr Luis Burroni ?Justice of the Peace ?San Luis concerning the application for administrative proceedings on behalf of Ms Lidia I. vila (Case No. -B-)?have been pending settlement since April this year, further to the completion of their preliminary examination and their referral to the Attorney-General, who handed down a decision on  March advising that no sanctions be applied; (ii) with regard to the case of Mr Juan Manuel Gonzlez, General Secretary, neither has any evidence been added to the submission to demonstrate that the case has not progressed in any way. In this regard, the Administrative Secretary of the High Court indicates that the case was referred to the Office of the State Prosecutor;?with regard to the mentioned orders to deduct pay for strike days, these have been issued by a court and fall beyond the competence of the High Court, as both the amparo applications that are pending decision have been brought by the same entity; and?finally, as mentioned by the complainant organization, a  per cent pay increase was agreed upon, and the Court indicates that at a meeting with the union there was a willingness to settle the disputes in a climate of collaboration and respect.
.The Committee takes note of this information. With regard to salary deductions for strike days, while the Committee notes that legal action has been taken in this regard, it recalls that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. With regard to the proceedings and the amparo application concerning the SIJUPU leaders, the Committee expects that these will conclude in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome. The Committee also asks the Government to send its observations regarding the alleged lack of participation of SIJUPU in the organization of the Judicial Training Institute. Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government confirms the complainant organizations claim that an agreement has been reached on a pay increase and that at a meeting with the trade union there was a willingness to settle the disputes in a climate of collaboration and respect.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras ?]. On that occasion, it expressed the hope that the judicial proceedings (concerning the dismissal of the General Secretary of the Trade Union of Puntanos?Judicial Employees (SIJUPU)) and/or administrative proceedings (summary proceedings against members of the SIJUPU executive committee) would be concluded in the near future and that the dialogue between the parties initiated, according to the Government, following the appointment of the new higher court authorities would continue to be consolidated.
.In a communication dated  November , the SIJUPU states that administrative proceedings instituted some two years ago against the SIJUPU executive committee members, Ms Mara Fabiana Aqun, Mr Ral Surez, Ms La Barroso and Ms Susana Muoz were riddled with irregularities and applications were therefore filed to have them declared null and statute-barred, but they have still not been settled, nor has there been a definitive ruling on the amparo (protection of constitutional rights) application filed by the SIJUPU General Secretary, Mr Juan Manuel Gonzlez in  (for having been dismissed while holding trade union immunity). Since , an application for review by the employer has been pending. The SIJUPU adds that it has been unable to participate in the organization of the Judicial Training Institute.
.The Committee expects that the appeals relating to the administrative proceedings against members of the SIJUPU executive committee and the amparo application relating to the dismissal of the SIJUPU General Secretary will be settled in the very near future. The Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and to send its observations regarding the alleged lack of participation of the SIJUPU in the organization of the Judicial Training Institute.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in June  [see nd Report, paras ?], when it regretted that the Government had not informed it of the situation with regard to the Trade Union of Puntanos?Judicial Employees?(SIJUPU) application for trade union status, and requested the Government to inform it of the ultimate outcome of the procedure.
.In a communication dated  February , the SIJUPU states that for the last three years, the trade union has suffered from discrimination, persecution and offence at the hands of the Higher Court of Justice, as demonstrated by the",2,2003,Argentina
233,"negotiating and signing of agreements with groups of employees who lack legal representation, and by notifying six trade union members, as well as members of the executive committee (who hold trade union immunity) of summary administrative proceedings against them. Ms Mara Fabiana Aqun, Mr Ral Surez, Ms La Barroso and Ms Susana Muoz, members of the SIJUPU and the executive committee, have been notified, to their astonishment, that summary administrative proceedings riddled with irregularities have been initiated against them. Given that these proceedings are beset by errors, motions have been filed to have them ruled null and statute-barred. In addition, the application for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) filed by the judicial employees of the first judicial district in  on the basis of the lack of safeguards and equal opportunities (they were not eligible for promotion) is before the Higher Court of Justice. As part of this application, two extrajudicial agreements were reached with this body, in July  and April , which could not be approved since they were not submitted to the Higher Court of Justice.
.The SIJUPU adds that the amparo application filed by the SIJUPU General Secretary, Mr Juan Manuel Gonzlez, in  (for having been dismissed while holding trade union immunity) is an additional measure, accepted by the employer with finality, but no definitive decision has been reached as to the substance, in spite of various requests made during the proceedings. A request for reconsideration made in  has yet to be heard. The SIJUPU maintains that very little has changed since the initial submission, given that the trade union continues to do its utmost to protect its members?rights, while the employer does not promote freedom of association and is a long way from complying with decisions handed down by national and international bodies in the interests of maintaining an ideal relationship with an organization which, in this case, is exercising the will of most judicial employees in the province by seeking to improve its members?quality of life. It stresses that it has achieved trade union status following a hard-fought battle lasting more than three years, during which it has had to overcome all manner of legal, administrative and bureaucratic obstacles, and that common sense should prevail when initiating effective and adult dialogue.
.In a communication dated  August , the Government states that in July , new judges were appointed to the Higher Court of Justice of San Luis Province. These appointments were the result of a significant social and political agreement, inasmuch as they marked the beginning of a process involving popular participation through a system of public hearings, similar to that adopted by the State for nominating judges to the Supreme Court. The principal issues to be heard by the Court included the trade union representation of the judicial employees, since two groups were vying for such status, posing various difficulties. This situation began to change after the Ministry of Labour granted the SIJUPU trade union status in its decision No. .
.Direct action was taken by staff belonging to both trade unions during the first year of the new Higher Court, up until the SIJUPU was recognized as a trade union. Legal proceedings were also brought in an attempt to obtain advantages or recognition by submitting all manner of complaints. These included an application for amparo with protective measures against the Higher Court itself (Judicial employees v. Higher Court of Justice (amparo)). In fact, this judicial measure brought the administrative career of the employees involved to a standstill. Records of the proceedings show that over  judges took cognizance of the case, as a result of numerous recusals after they considered that they were, for various reasons, involved or implicated in the case that led to the application for amparo being submitted. In these circumstances, an agreement was reached with the complainants whereby they were permitted to participate in staff competitions and, subsequently, to be promoted, which has since been made effective. This means that the substance of the issue and of the original complaint has been resolved.
.The Government also states that at the same time as the agreement was taking shape, the Committee of the Trade Union of Judicial Employees was meeting with the Higher Court to discuss overhauling labour conditions, the Statutes concerning judicial employees and conditions for dismissal, reaching significant agreements. The Government states that, to date, there have been no new confrontations since the new judges were appointed, while also recognizing that there are other matters that have yet to be resolved, such as those subject to judicial or administrative procedures, the resolution of which falls under the remit of those who are specifically and exclusively competent in such matters, which are not matters for the Higher Court.
.The Committee notes with interest the information supplied by the Government, and in particular that: () it was decided to grant the SIJUPU the trade union status that it had requested some years ago; () an agreement was reached with the employees who had filed applications for amparo, whereby they were permitted to participate in staff competitions, and, subsequently, to be promoted; () significant agreements have been reached between the trade union and the Court authorities; and () since the new judges were appointed to the Higher Court, there have been no new confrontations, but there are also other matters that have yet to be resolved, such as those subject to judicial or administrative procedures. In these circumstances, the Committee hopes that the judicial and/or administrative proceedings will reach a conclusion in the near future and that the dialogue between the parties initiated, according to the Government, following the appointment of the new Higher Court authorities, will continue to be consolidated.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in November  [see th Report, paras. -], when it made the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any negotiations or dialogue undertaken between SIJUPU and the Higher Court of Justice of San Luis Province (STJSL).(b) With regard to the request for trade union status (personaria gremial) by SIJUPU, the Committee regrets the long time which elapsed for the adoption of a decision on this question and expresses the hope that the authorities will issue a decision soon. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government stated that the Higher Court of Justice of the province, in its new composition, had taken careful note of the Committees recommendations. Since the steps taken in July , and in recognition of the legal status of the Trade Union of Judicial Employees of San Luis (SIJUPU), the Court had embarked upon a fruitful dialogue that had made it possible to resolve all the problems raised. The Government also stated that the Court had undertaken to continue its open dialogue with the trade union.
.The Committee notes this information. It regrets that the Government has not informed it of the situation with regard to SIJUPUs application for trade union status (personaria gremial), and requests the Government to inform it of the ultimate outcome of the procedure.
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  May and  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

234,"of his wage arrears as ordered by the court, and keep it informed in this regard; and () report on the results of the appeal for review lodged by Vilma Fuentes de Ochoa and Susana Muoz, members of SIJUPU, regarding their dismissals.(e) As regards the alleged preventive sanctions against Fredy Lpez Camacho, general secretary, Rubn Magallanes, social action secretary, Gladis Abdn, records secretary, and the summons to give evidence sent to Mario Becerra, secretary, and Silvia Zavala, a union member, the Committee requests the complainant to send additional information in this respect (nature of the sanctions and date on which they were imposed, supporting documentation, etc.).(f) As regards the allegations concerning the violation of trade union rights and of the national legislation by the STJSL, which purported to discuss trade union issues with various groups and individuals, disregarding the fact that the SIJUPU, according to the complainant, is the most representative organization, the Committee requests the Government to provide it rapidly with its observations.",2,2003,Argentina
235,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras. -] and on that occasion made the following recommendations:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any judicial action initiated by the dismissed or suspended trade unionists mentioned in the complaint in the Alberdi S.A. (COMODIN Supermarkets) enterprise and expects that, if the dismissals and suspension of these trade unionists are found to be anti-union in nature, they will be reinstated without loss of pay and without delay and, if reinstatement is not possible, that they will be adequately compensated.The Committee firmly expects that, as soon as the Si.Tra.M. trade union organization has complied with the necessary legal requirements, the administrative authority will grant it trade union registration as it requested. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In a communication dated  April , the Government referred to the status of the judicial actions undertaken by the trade unionists dismissed by the Alberdi S.A. enterprise mentioned in the complaint. Specifically, it states that, of the dismissed workers mentioned, Mr. Andrs Ricardo Guanuco and Mr. Diego Ramir Yomar made an application for the protection of constitutional rights to the First Chamber of the Labour Court of the City of San Salvador de Jujuy. This application was rejected by the Court, which led to their filing an appeal for cassation and unconstitutionality. The latter was favourably decided by the Higher Court of Justice, which ordered the First Chamber of the Labour Court to have jurisdiction over the case. Currently, the proceedings are awaiting decision. Moreover, it states that Mr. Ricardo Gramajo filed a claim for unfair dismissal and trade union protection, from which the parties have been summoned to a conciliation hearing that has not yet taken place. There is currently no record of any judicial action with regard to the worker Mr. Ezequiel Eduardo Lpez (suspended).
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee hopes that the judicial authorities will hand down their decision soon and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings under way. Moreover, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the situation with regard to the trade union registration of the trade union organization Si.Tra.M.

236,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated April  from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC), on behalf of the Argentinian Trade Union of Private Tutors (SADOP). The Government sent its observations in communications dated  July and  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). It has also ratified the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization alleges that since the negotiating committee was established in the private teaching sector in , the employers, in violation of the duty of good faith and the duty to make every effort, laid down in legislation, have resorted to unfair practices (the refusal to attend meetings, delaying measures, the denial of the right of teachers to bargain collectively in the private teaching sector) in order to avoid negotiating a collective agreement in the private teaching sector. The complainant organization also alleges that, with regard to this situation, the Ministry of Labour has been unhelpful and has not acted in any way, ignoring its obligation to encourage and promote collective bargaining in accordance with Conventions Nos.  and , and has not penalized the employers in spite of their non-compliance with the legislation and in spite of trade union appeals.
.The Committee notes that the Government highlights that: () the legal authorities, rather than the administrative authorities, are responsible for examining and possibly penalizing unfair practices, among which the legislation includes bad faith in collective bargaining and, more specifically, the non-attendance of the negotiating parties at meetings, the unwarranted refusal to negotiate in good faith or provoking delays; () the legislation provides for penalties equivalent to large fines; () the administrative authorities have summoned the parties to begin a collective bargaining process, encouraging this by providing them with an environment in which they can bargain collectively on a voluntary basis, according to the provisions of the ILO Conventions (the Government attaches to its response a copy of the minutes of the meetings which had taken place).
.In this respect, the Committee observes that the following emerges from the minutes of the meeting held between SADOP and representatives of the employers?sector at the Ministry of Labour on  December :First, both parties confirmed their willingness and broad spirit of dialogue and agreement under the provisions of the rules concerning the procedure of negotiations adopted on  September  in accordance with Decision S.S.R.L. No. /.Second, as agreed at the meeting of  December, the trade union representatives present a draft General Negotiating Agreement and hand a copy to the employers?institutions who are present and who undertake to analyse it and express a formal opinion or make a counter-proposal in writing, at the meeting which is scheduled to this effect, on  February , at . p.m., at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security.
.The Committee recalls the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relationships, and that it is important that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement; moreover genuine and constructive negotiations are a necessary component to establish and maintain a relationship of confidence between the parties [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ].
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to continue to make every effort so that the parties can conclude a collective agreement for the private teaching sector, pursuant to the agreement reached in December .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to continue to make every effort so that the parties concerned can conclude a collective agreement for the private teaching sector, pursuant to the agreement reached in December .",5,2003,Argentina
237,".The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in November  [see th Report, paras ?] and on that occasion requested the Government to keep it informed of the final decision handed down by the judicial authorities with respect to the participation by a new trade union organization, the Union of Argentine Teachers (UDA), in the renegotiation of Joint Accord No.  of , concluded between the United Union of Education Workers of Mendoza (SUTE) and the Directorate General of Schools (DGE).
.In a communication of  August , the Government indicates that it is awaiting the ruling of the Appeals Court with regard to the amparo action presented by the UDA to the First District Third Civil Court of the Province of Mendoza.
.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the amparo action presented by the UDA.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, on examining allegations regarding the failure of the Directorate General of Schools (DGE) of the Province of Mendoza since  to appoint its representatives to continue to negotiate a collective agreement for the sector with the United Union of Education Workers of Mendoza (SUTE), the Committee expressed the hope that a collective agreement would soon be concluded for the sector. Moreover, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the final decision handed down by the judicial authority with respect to the participation by a new trade union organization, the Union of Argentine Teachers (UDA), in the renegotiation of Joint Accord No.  of  concluded between the SUTE and the DGE.
.In a communication dated  April , the Government stated that on  December , the DGE and SUTE concluded a collective agreement on the wage structure for teachers and union contributions. This agreement was endorsed by the Executive Authority in Decree No. /. The Government also stated that there was still no decision with regard to the action for the protection of constitutional rights presented by the UDA to the First District Third Civil Court of the Province of Mendoza.
.The Committee notes with interest the agreement concluded between the DGE and the trade union organization SUTE. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final decision on the action for the protection of constitutional rights presented by the UDA.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, on examining allegations regarding the failure of the Directorate General of Schools (DGE) of the province of Mendoza to appoint its representatives to continue to negotiate a collective agreement for the sector with the United Union of Education Workers of Mendoza (SUTE), the Committee recalled that Article  of Convention No.  provides that measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers?organizations and workers?organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. Consequently, the Committee requested the Government to take measures to this effect and to keep it informed on the outcome of the negotiation of the collective agreement in question. Moreover, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the final decision handed down by the judicial authority with respect to the participation by a new trade union organization, the Union of Argentine Teachers (UDA), in the renegotiation of joint accord No.  of  concluded between the SUTE and the DGE.
.In a communication dated  August , the Government states that, in the case of the action for the protection of constitutional rights presented by the SUTE against the DGE, the Supreme Court of Justice of the province of Mendoza rejected the claim made by the SUTE through its decision of October , thus confirming the decision of the Civil Court of Appeal, and alongside it the suspension of the call for the election of the Assessment and Disciplinary Boards (this would involve the participation of the UDA organization in negotiations). The Government adds that, regarding the procedure followed in order to agree on collective bargaining for the sector, the intention of the provincial government to convene negotiations on a collective labour agreement for the public sector was confirmed in Law No. . This was implemented through Decree No. /, article  of which states The collective bargaining process for workers of the Public Administration shall be convened? In article  of resolution No. -G/, the Public Administration Ministry invites the parties to begin the collective bargaining process related to Provincial Public Administration in the Education Sector? The Government adds that the DGE has already begun internal administrative procedures in order to proceed to the appointment of the public employees who will represent the DGE during the collective bargaining process convened in Decree No. /.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee expresses the hope that, following the start of the administrative procedures as reported by the Government, a collective agreement will be concluded for the sector. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA), the United Union of Education Workers of Mendoza (SUTE) and the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) dated March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of March , the United Union of Education Workers of Mendoza (SUTE), the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) and the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) state that the SUTE is a trade union body with legal status in the sphere of education workers of the province of Mendoza.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the authorities of the province of Mendoza organize education in the province and for that purpose have established an independent body with the personality called the Directorate General of Schools (DGE).
.The complainants note that within this institutional framework the SUTE has concluded numerous joint accords and collective agreements with the DGE over the past decade. The complainants allege that in December  the provinces new authorities came into office, including the new Directorate General of Schools, and that despite repeated notifications, warnings and legal proceedings to persuade the new Government to appoint joint members in order to negotiate a collective agreement for the sector, the DGE has taken no notice and has still not named any joint members, which has brought negotiations to a standstill.
.The complainant organizations also allege that the DGE denounced an earlier joint accord concluded with the SUTE (No.  dated  August ) and that it is seeking to establish a new framework for negotiations for that particular joint accord, and refusing to recognize the representatives of the workers?sector. The complainant organizations indicate that the accord denounced by the DGE related to the manner of electing and integrating the Assessment and Disciplinary Boards of the Directorate General of Schools. The complainant organizations state that the joint accord established that representation on those boards would be of four members appointed by the State, four by the SUTE and five appointed following a free election of all teachers in the province, whether or not affiliated to the SUTE. When that accord was concluded on  August , the first boards were established with a mandate for their members of three years, with new elections to be held on  October . The DGE did not call elections and denounced the agreement, thus contravening article  of Act No.  that provides that agreements shall remain in force until new ones replace them.
.Lastly, the complainant organizations state that it was only by means of an amparo action (appeal for the protection of the constitutional rights) lodged by the SUTE (record No. - entitled United Union of Education Workers of Mendoza against Directorate General of Schools) before the th Civil Court of the first district of the province of Mendoza, that by express order of the judge they succeeded in beginning the election process for the boards in question, but the DGE appealed that decision and Civil Court No.  of the province of Mendoza revoked the ruling of first instance, leaving the electoral process suspended. As a result, the electoral process for the members of the boards mentioned in the joint accord has once again been interrupted.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that it is true that the Directorate General of Schools (DGE) of the province of Mendoza concluded numerous collective labour agreements and joint accords with the United Union of Education Workers of Mendoza (SUTE), the most recent one in  (joint accord No. ), which the DGE denounced when it expired in . It",5,2003,Argentina
238,"also states that neither the Government nor the DGE violated or sought to violate the provisions of article  of the National Constitution, which establishes the fundamental right to collective bargaining. According to the Government, it was and is the SUTE that has refused to negotiate and that took legal action after warning the DGE to negotiate in good faith.
.The Government indicates that it is true that in  there was a change of authorities within the democratic system in force in the country, but that it is not true that the new authorities did not call for collective bargaining. Provincial Decree No. / ordered that collective bargaining between the provincial authorities and the bodies representing the various sectors of the public administration should continue. It should be pointed out that at one of the first meetings, the SUTE got up and refused to negotiate if the trade union organization, Union of Argentine Teachers (UDA), took part.
.With respect to joint accord No.  of , the Government states that the accord established its validity, as a period of ""three years from its official approval, with its validity being extended until conditions are amended by another joint accord ..."". Decree No.  officially approved the accord in question on  September , and as a result the agreed period of three years expired on  September . The DGE denounced the accord on  September . In the same document in which the accord was denounced, the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour and Social Security requested that a joint meeting be convened. The Office of the Undersecretary, in accordance with the provisions of the accord, and as stipulated in Act No. , convened the DGE, the SUTE and the UDA to joint negotiations. The first meeting of the parties was held on  September .
.The Government states that the SUTE requested the exclusion of the UDA (a trade union organization also comprised of teachers, similar to the SUTE, both with legal personality recognized by the Ministry of Labour). The trade union organization UDA cited its representativity (recognized by the Ministry of Labour) and the provisions authorizing it to take part in the negotiations. In addition, it requested that the call for exclusion made by the SUTE be refused and that the periods and deadlines in place for the convening of elections and the configuration of the boards mentioned in joint accord No.  be suspended.
.The Government adds that on  September  the SUTE presented an amparo action before the courts, which the DGE opposed on the grounds of form and substance. Although the judge of the th Civil, Commercial and Mining Court of the province of Mendoza (first instance) ruled in favour of the amparo action and ordered elections to be called to fill the vacancies on the boards mentioned in joint accord No.  by  March , in the second instance the amparo action was rejected. The UDA also lodged an amparo action before the courts maintaining that Decree No. /, which officially approved joint accord No.  of , was unconstitutional. On  April , the SUTE lodged special remedies for unconstitutionality and judicial review before the Supreme Court of Justice of the province of Mendoza. The Supreme Court of Justice of the province of Mendoza rejected the application for judicial review and formally allowed the action of unconstitutionality. Since  September , the action of unconstitutionality has been pending before the courts, for consideration by the Ministers of the Supreme Court of Justice, and will shortly be ruled upon.
.According to the Government, the DGE has conducted itself in accordance with the law and the Constitution, it has denounced a joint accord and has engaged in a new round of negotiations.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations allege that since  the Directorate General of Schools (DGE) of the province of Mendoza has refused to appoint its representatives to continue the negotiation of the collective agreement for the sector with the United Union of Education Workers of Mendoza (SUTE) - a trade union organization with legal personality, which, in accordance with Argentine legislation allows it to be the sole collective bargaining agent. In addition, the complainant organizations object to the decision by the DGE to denounce joint accord No.  of  concluded with the SUTE relating to the election and integration of the tripartite Assessment and Disciplinary Boards and that as a result it did not convene elections for its members and is trying to convene new joint meetings for new negotiations on this particular issue.
.As regards the alleged failure of the DGE since  to appoint its representatives to continue to negotiate a collective agreement for the sector with the SUTE, the Committee observes that the Government states in general terms that, by way of Provincial Decree No. /, it was ordered that collective bargaining between the provincial authorities and the bodies representing the various sectors of the public administration should continue. Nevertheless, the Committee observes from the allegations that the negotiation of a collective agreement for the education sector is excessively delayed. The Committee recalls that Article  of Convention No.  provides that measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers?and workers?organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to this effect and to keep it informed of the result of the negotiation of the collective agreement in question.
.Concerning the alleged denunciation of joint accord No.  of  by the DGE, the Committee notes the Governments acknowledgement that the SUTE and the DGE concluded numerous accords and collective agreements and that the most recent joint accord concluded was joint accord No.  mentioned by the complainants, which was officially approved by Decree No. /. In addition, the Committee notes the Governments information that: () the DGE denounced joint accord No.  when it expired in  and at the same time requested the Office of the Undersecretary of Labour and Social Security to convene joint meetings to conduct new negotiations; () the Office of the Undersecretary convened a joint meeting of the DGE, the SUTE and another trade union organization (the Union of Argentine Teachers - UDA) which had not participated in the negotiation of joint accord No. ; () the SUTE requested that the judicial authority exclude the UDA (which, according to the Government, also has legal personality), and the UDA cited its representativity and the provisions that authorized it to take part in the negotiations and asked that the call by the SUTE be rejected; and () the matter is currently pending before the Supreme Court of Justice of the province of Mendoza.
.First of all, the Committee considers that, in these circumstances, the denunciation of the joint accord in itself - the corresponding legal requirements being respected - does not violate the principles of free collective bargaining. Furthermore, as to the intention of the SUTE to exclude the UDA from the joint negotiating committee, the Committee does not have sufficient facts to determine the representativity of the UDA. Whatever the case may be, the Committee observes that this matter has been submitted to the judicial authority. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the final decision handed down by the judicial authority in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the alleged failure of the Directorate General of Schools (DGE) of the province of Mendoza since  to appoint its representatives to continue to negotiate a collective agreement for the sector with the United Union of Education Workers of Mendoza (SUTE), the Committee recalls that Article  of Convention No.  provides that measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers?and workers?organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to this effect and to keep it informed of the result of the negotiation of the collective agreement in question.(b) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the final decision handed down by the judicial authority with respect to the participation by a new trade union organization, the Union of Argentine Teachers (UDA), in the renegotiation of joint accord No.  of  concluded between the SUTE and the DGE.",5,2003,Argentina
239,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Association of State Workers (ATE) of February . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July and  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of February , the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Association of State Workers (ATE) state that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Human Resources Training decided that the ATE lacked the legitimacy to represent the workers in the sector employed by the Nucleoelctrica Argentina S.A. (NASA) enterprise, for collective bargaining purposes.
.The complainants add that on  May , Decision No.  was issued by the National Directorate of Collective Bargaining setting up the bargaining committee for the conclusion of a collective agreement in the NASA enterprise. The ATE filed an application for reconsideration of the decision, together with a subsidiary appeal to the higher administrative authority, requesting to be included in the bargaining committee, since, on the workers?side, it only included the Argentine Federation of Light and Power Workers (FATLYF), the Villa Mara Regional Light and Power Workers?Trade Union and the Paran Light and Power Workers?Trade Union. The Directorate responded favourably to the application for reconsideration of its decision and ordered the inclusion of the ATE in the bargaining committee.
.The complainants add that after the inclusion of the ATE, the FATLYF claimed the exclusive right to bargain in the sector and ATE maintained that it had the right to participate in the committee (without demanding exclusivity or the exclusion of the other trade unions from the committee). The matter was finally settled through administrative channels, with Ministerial Decision No. / of  September  granting the FATLYF and its affiliates exclusive rights to represent the workers.
.The complainants explain that the ATE never denied the right of the Federation or its affiliates to participate in bargaining, given that this is a right of the workers of the NASA enterprise, and hence their representative bodies should endeavour to establish bargaining committees that represent the workers?interests, irrespective of which trade unions represent them.
.According to the complainants, the State is denying the right of ATE to participate in collective bargaining in the enterprise, despite the fact that it has trade union status (pessonera gremial) and has a large membership, with even more members than the other organizations, on grounds that ?according to Ministerial Decision No. / ?decisions have been taken under which the alleged legitimate trade unions expanded the scope of their activity, displacing the ATE. The complainants point out that the decisions were adopted under procedures in which the ATE did not take part and that no comparison had been made between membership numbers which would have deprived the ATE of its representative trade union status.
.The complainants assert that the right of representation should in no case be granted to one trade union without hearing the other trade union or trade unions who would thereby lose their status, and that this is the case of the decisions underlying the administrative act which is the subject of the complaint. The workers are clearly willing to support the action and participation of the ATE in defence of their interests in the NASA enterprise. This reality can by no means be denied, restricting the freedom of the workers to express themselves through their trade union. There are two trade unions with the right to represent the workers, and both undeniably have the right to participate in collective bargaining and hence to represent the workers?collective interests.
.Lastly, the complainants state that the ATE has more paid-up members in the sector to which the NASA enterprise belongs, both among nuclear plant workers and among administrative personnel employed under the National Atomic Energy Commission.
.In its communications dated  July and  September , the Government states that the complaint is based on the exclusion of the ATE from the bargaining committee set up to discuss the collective agreement of the staff employed at the Nucleoelctrica Argentina S.A. (NASA) enterprise. The Government points out that under Argentine legislation, the most representative trade unions have exclusive rights to bargain collectively. According to the Government, the Committee on Freedom of Association has considered that granting preference to the most representative trade union in collective bargaining is not contrary to the principles of freedom of association and it is commonly found in many legal systems.
.The Government states that in this case it is the Argentine Federation of Light and Power Workers and its regional affiliates, the Villa Mara Regional Light and Power Workers?Trade Union and the Paran Light and Power Workers?Trade Union, which have the status of most representative trade unions. At no time has the ATE demonstrated that it is the most representative union in the sector. Moreover, through a number of administrative acts by the implementing authority, the staff of the Embalse Nuclear Power Plant have been assigned to representation by the Villa Mara Light and Power Workers?Trade Union and the staff of the Atucha Nuclear Power Plant assigned to representation by the Paran Light and Power Workers?Trade Union.
.The Government states further that exclusion from collective bargaining does not imply non-recognition of the trade union rights (the right to take direct action, etc.) enjoyed by the ATE in the enterprise concerned. According to the Government, it can be inferred from the above that there has been no violation of freedom of association. Finally, in its communication of  September , the Government states that the ATE lodged an appeal before the judiciary against the administrative acts to which it objects, and that the National Labour Court of Appeals rejected the appeal (in its decision, the judicial authority indicates that the complainant should channel its claim through the procedures of the Trade Unions Act No. , on the basis of either a conflict of representativity or a dispute of representativity in a sector under articles  and subsequent of Act No. ).
.The Committee observes that the complainants object to the decision taken by the administrative authority to the effect that the Association of State Workers (ATE) lacks the legitimacy to represent the workers in the sector employed by the Nucleoelctrica Argentina S.A. (NASA) enterprise, resulting in the exclusion of the ATE from the bargaining committee for the conclusion of a collective agreement. The Committee also observes that the complainants state that: () although the ATE has trade union status ?the necessary prerequisite to be able to bargain collectively ?and a large membership ?with, according to the complainants, even more members than the other organizations ?it is being denied the right to participate in collective bargaining; () the ATE claims the right to participate in collective bargaining, but does not demand exclusivity or the exclusion of the other authorized trade unions; and () the ministerial decisions declaring that the other trade union organizations have the right to represent the workers were adopted after procedures in which the ATE did not take part and without comparing membership numbers.
.The Committee observes that the Government states that: (i) Argentine legislation provides that the most representative trade unions have exclusive rights to bargain collectively; (ii) in this case, it is the Argentine Federation of Light and Power Workers and its affiliates which have the status of most representative trade union; (iii) at no time has the ATE demonstrated that it is the most representative organization; and (iv) the judicial authority rejected the appeal lodged against the administrative acts.
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that the competent authorities should, in all cases, have the power to proceed to an objective verification of any claim by a union that it represents the majority of the workers in an undertaking, provided that such a claim appears to be plausible. If the union concerned is found to be the majority union, the authorities should take appropriate conciliatory measures to obtain the employers recognition of that union for collective bargaining purposes [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.In this case, the Committee does not have sufficient information to determine whether the complainant organization ATE is the most representative organization in the Nucleoelctrica Argentina S.A. (NASA) enterprise. However, noting that the judicial authority indicated that ATE should channel its claim through the procedures of conflict of representativity or of dispute of representativity in a sector so as to determine whether it is the most representative organization, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any judicial procedures that ATE may undertake in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee recalls that the competent authorities should, in all cases, have the power to proceed to an objective verification",0,2003,Argentina
240,"of any claim by a union that it represents the majority of the workers in an undertaking, provided that such a claim appears to be plausible. If the union concerned is found to be the majority union, the authorities should take appropriate conciliatory measures to obtain the employers recognition of that union for collective bargaining purposes.(b) Noting that the judicial authority indicated in the present case that the Association of State Workers (ATE) should channel its claim through the procedures of conflict of representativity or of dispute of representativity in a sector under the provisions of the Trade Unions Act No.  so as to determine whether it is the most representative organization, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any judicial procedures that ATE may undertake in this respect.",4,2003,Argentina
241,".The complaint is contained in a letter from the Buenos Aires Police Union (SIPOBA) and the Argentine Federation of Police and Prison Service Unions (FASIPP) dated  December . SIPOBA and FASIPP provided additional information in a letter dated  January . The Government sent its observations in a letter dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their letter of  December , the Buenos Aires Police Union (SIPOBA) and the Argentine Federation of Police and Prison Service Unions (FASIPP) complained that on  April  an Assembly was held for the purpose of forming the Buenos Aires Police Union (SIPOBA) and that as a consequence the Buenos Aires police authority instigated disciplinary proceedings against the members of the trade union, arguing that they were in breach of the provisions of article , paragraphs  and , and paragraph  of Provincial Decree-Law No. /. These proceedings led to the dismissal of the chairman of the provisional steering committee, principal officer Nicols Alberto Masi for exercising, according to the police authority, ?an activity to promote and enrol members within the force in order to form a police trade union ?all of which seriously affected discipline and responsibility for assignment of duties, an offence mitigated by the absence of sanctions in their service record and aggravated by the public importance of the matter?
.The complainants add that on  August , FASIPP applied for registration, and that by Decision No. /, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security refused that application. The decision was appealed in the courts and the National Employment Appeals Court, Chamber V, refused the appeal on the grounds that it was formally inadmissible since the decision subject to the appeal was not final, since it was not an executable decision and because the confirmation of the administrative refusal relied on matters of fact and only incidentally ruled on the rights of police officers, an aspect which could be determined in the courts, subject to compliance with the basic requirements as to the viability of the application.
.In compliance with the basic requirements mentioned by the National Employment Appeals Court, a list of members, membership forms and list of members of the Executive Committee, together with the Constitution and other documents required under article  and conclusions of Law No. , were submitted to the Ministry of Labour on  April , thus fulfilling all the requirements of that law for the granting of trade union status. They state that despite all this, on  July , the Minister of Labour and Social Security denied the application for trade union registration presented by the Buenos Aires Police Union by Decision No. . An appeal for review of the refusal was submitted on  July .
.The complainants indicate that the previous submission was supplemented on  October  in letter No.  by a copy of opinion No.  of the Attorney-General in the National Employment Appeals Court in favour of the trade union registration, reform of the Constitution in line with the observations by officials of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and appointment of members in accordance with resolution DNAS No. /. Despite that, in decision No.  dated  September , the Minister of Labour and Social Security refused the application for review.
.The complainants mention that article bis of the National Constitution provides the right of any worker, without distinction and without any restrictions, to form a trade union. Likewise, international law, which ranks equally with the Constitution (article , paragraph , of the Constitution) provides the right of freedom of association and the right to organize without interference from the public authorities (American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Covenant of San Jose de Costa Rica). In this regard, the complainants recall that, as expressly recognized by the Government, there is no law that exempts the security forces from the provisions of Law No.  or affects or generally limits their right to form a trade union. In the light of this omission, it is logical to apply the provisions of the Constitution, especially taking into account the principle of legality and article  of the National Constitution. Any gap in the law and the alleged legal vacuum cannot be interpreted as creating a prohibition.
.In their letter of  January , SIPOBA and FASIPP allege that the administrative authority refused the application for trade union registration submitted by the Santa Fe Provincial Police Professional Association (which was the subject of an appeal to the courts in September ). The complainant organizations also allege that the General Secretary of that organization, Mr. Miguel Orlando Salazar, was suspended without pay and his arm and badge were withdrawn because he had organized the workers?protest at the late payment of wages and commented in the press on the lack of police equipment.
.In its letter of  May , the Government indicates that Convention No.  leaves it up to the law in each ILO member State whether or not to allow the formation of trade unions in the armed forces and the police, and article  of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights guarantees the freedom to form trade unions allowing only restrictions which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order. Furthermore, article  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights fully endorses the right of freedom of association, the only restriction to the exercise of that right being the case of members of the armed forces and the police, and article  of the American Convention on Human Rights (Covenant of San Jose de Costa Rica), paragraph , states The provisions of this article do not bar the imposition of legal restrictions, including even deprivation of the exercise of the right of association, on members of the armed forces and the police?
.The Government states that it is essential to recall that these international treaties are integral to Argentine law as instruments of constitutional standing, as laid down in article , paragraph , of the Constitution. It is thus clear that the unionization of the security forces and the police is contained in Argentine law in accordance with international instruments, since at present there is no other specific legislation on this issue. It adds that although freedom of association is fully recognized, solely limited in the cases discussed above, it was decided that because of the nature of the activities of the armed forces and the police, it was not appropriate for them to be organized in trade unions.
.There is a hierarchical principle in the security forces which conflicts with the principle of trade union democratization, the latter being an essential condition for the recognition of the authority of trade union associations as collective subjects of labour law. A trade union is a group of workers united by affinity and solidarity whose functions are independent of employers and the State itself.
.Independence vis--vis employers and the State, specifically set out in article  of the Trade Unions Act, Law No. , is an essential requirement. No one can overrule or interfere in the actions of a trade union in such a way as to prevent it fulfilling its principal objective. The armed forces and the police are not independent of the State, but represent it and are part of it, since they are the sole repositories of public authority and guarantors of internal security. Moreover, in ratifying Convention No. , article  of Law No.  provided that it should not apply to the armed and security forces. The consistency of Laws Nos. ,  (Collective Bargaining Act) and , as well as the abovementioned international instruments which have constitutional standing, show that the legal system has exercised the right to restrict the right to freedom of association for members of the armed forces, security forces and the police, and that this restriction in no way constitutes any violation whatsoever of the letter and spirit of Convention No. .
.The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security has frequently spoken on the subject, recalling that the task of security imposed by law on the armed forces and the police, under a vertical hierarchical structure, is essential to the maintenance of the internal discipline of the forces and its effectiveness in fulfilling its tasks, which would be rendered very difficult if a trade union for these categories were established. Consequently, the applications for trade union registration were refused. The Ministers position was upheld on several occasions by the judiciary.
.Granting the right to form trade unions to the security forces is a highly complex issue given the countrys realities and characteristics. It would also generate a climate of debate which would affect peoples security, especially considering that the armed forces and the police are the sole",-1,2002,Argentina
242,"responsible enforcement agencies for that purpose. This does not mean a failure to recognize the rights of the members of these forces under appropriate administrative mechanisms which guarantee these rights. Finally, the Government states that under the abovementioned international provisions which carry constitutional standing, comparative law and the decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the judicial authority, it is concluded that non-recognition of the right of the armed forces and the police to establish trade unions cannot be considered a violation of Convention No. .
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations allege that the national administrative authority refused the applications for trade union registration of the Buenos Aires Police Union (SIPOBA) and the Santa Fe Provincial Police Professional Association (APROPOL). In addition, the complainant organizations allege that as a reprisal, after the formation of SIPOBA, one of the members of its Executive Committee, Principal Officer Nicols Alberto Masi, was dismissed and the General Secretary of APROPOL, Mr. Miguel Orlando Salazar, was dismissed for claiming payment of wage arrears and complaining of the lack of police equipment on behalf of the workers. The Committee notes the general reply of the Government with respect to the right to organize of the police.
.The Committee recalls that Argentina has ratified Convention No. , Article  of which provides that The extent to which the guarantees provided for in this Convention shall apply to the armed forces and the police shall be determined by national laws or regulations?
.In the light of this text, there is no doubt that the International Labour Conference intended to leave it up to each State to decide the extent to which it considered it appropriate to apply the rights envisaged in the Convention to members of the armed forces and the police, in other words, by implication, that States which have ratified the Convention are not obliged to recognize the rights set out therein for those categories of workers [see th Report, Case No.  (France), para. ]. Nevertheless several member States have recognized the right to organize of the police and the armed forces
.In these circumstances, taking into account that the Convention left the issue up to member States to decide, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body that it should decide that the case does not require further consideration.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examinations.",-1,2002,Argentina
243,".The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting and on that occasion requested the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the competent authorities of Misiones Province immediately transfer to the Association of State Workers (ATE), in money of legal tender, the amount of the trade union dues of its members that it wrongfully withheld between January  and October , with payment of the corresponding interest [see th Report, paras. -].
.In a communication of  September , the Government indicates that a payment agreement was concluded between the Government of Misiones Province and the ATE on  March . By virtue of the agreement, a consensus was reached to pay the amounts owed by the Province plus interests in money of legal tender and in four monthly instalments. The Government adds that three of the four instalments have already been paid and the agreement is being fully implemented.
.The Committee takes note of this information with satisfaction.
.The complaint is presented in a communication from the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Association of State Workers (ATE) dated  September .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  September , the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Association of State Workers (ATE) allege that the Ministry of Public Health of Misiones Province has not deposited in the ATE account for this purpose the trade union dues of members for the January  to October  period. The complainant organizations add that on  June  they lodged a judicial request before the department for common pleas of the first instance of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (CSJN), with regard to this matter against the Misiones Province, claiming the amounts withheld.
.The complainant organizations add that although, in September , the Supreme Court ordered the sums owing to be paid, and in June  ordered the seizure of assets of the province, Misiones Province replied, on  June , this time invoking the provincial law for the consolidation of debt in the provincial state and requesting that the seizure of assets be lifted. The complainant organizations state that the provincial law invoked by Misiones Province lays down the consolidation by the provincial state of all recognized debt after  March  and before  January . The Supreme Court decided to admit the petition of Misiones Province and annulled the seizure of assets.
.According to the complainant organizations, it is important to note that the sums owing to the ATE do not represent a default on consideration in any form but are deducted by the State acting as ""withholding agent"" in accordance with legal authorization and that this money that has been withheld (wrongfully because the deposit has not been made to the account of the payee) does not belong to Misiones Province and should have never formed part of its assets. This sum belongs to the workers who are members of the trade union organization. This implies that the provincial state, with the support of the national State through its highest judicial body, carried out an actual confiscation of assets belonging to the workers and that, in spite of the committed violation being wholly recognized (by the province itself and by the Supreme Court), the provincial state was allowed to return the sum of money that never belonged to it in the form of provincial bonds, with interest only up to December , through an exceedingly lengthy administrative process.
.Finally, the complainant organizations indicate that the trade union is still feeling the repercussions of the trade union dues deducted from the workers by the provincial state and wrongfully withheld from the payee account of the ATE from January  to October , i.e. eight years ago; and that the trade union, which groups together the workers of the public administration, relies solely on the support of its members and that this is the money that the provincial state has decided to withhold for itself, incorporating it into its assets.
.In its communications of  September  and  January , the Government indicates that, with regard to the allegations of the supposed violation of freedom of association relating to the conduct of the Ministry of Public Health of Misiones Province as withholding agent for trade union dues, there is a final decision by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation in which the application for the case in question of provincial law No. , through which Misiones Province adhered to Law No.  on economic and financial emergency, is considered legitimate and in accordance with the law.
.The Government adds that throughout  and , Argentina underwent an unprecedented financial crisis that led to a situation where payment to its external creditors and to international lending organizations came to a virtual halt and it was also impossible for it to pay all its internal debts. In the framework of this unusual state of affairs, the applicable law consolidated all recognized debt after  March  and before  January . The consolidated debt was paid with bonds (with a redemption period and regular interest) quoted on the stock exchange and widely used to pay the debts of the State. The reason for this law was the public scale of the economic and financial emergency affecting the State and the provinces and it was applicable to all obligations payable without exception, unless explicitly laid down in the law itself. On a number of occasions the constitutionality of the emergency provisions was confirmed by the courts, as in the case mentioned.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations allege that the Ministry of Public Health of Misiones Province did not transfer to the Association of State Workers (ATE) the trade union dues of its members that had been deducted between January  and October  and that, as a result of a decision by the highest national legal authority, the province was allowed to pay the equivalent amount of the trade union dues deducted in the form of provincial bonds, with interest only up until December , through an exceedingly lengthy administrative procedure.
.The Committee notes the Governments statement that: () the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation considered the application of the provincial law, through which Misiones Province adhered to Law No.  on economic and financial emergency, legitimate and in accordance with the law; () during  and , Argentina faced a financial crisis that resulted in the cessation of payments to its external creditors and to international lending organizations and in the impossibility for it to pay all its internal debts; () the applicable emergency law in this case consolidated all recognized debt after  March  and before  January ; () the consolidated debt was paid in the form of bonds that were quoted on the stock exchange and that were widely used to pay the debts of the State; () the reason for this law was the public scale of the economic and financial emergency affecting the national State and the provinces, and it was applicable to all debts without exception.
.The Committee notes that the Government recognizes that the trade union dues of members of the ATE deducted by the public health authorities of Misiones Province have not been transferred to the trade union organization. The Committee understands the economic and financial difficulties that have affected the country for some years now. However, the Committee emphasizes that the trade union dues do not belong to the authorities, nor are they public funds, but rather they are an amount on deposit that the authorities may not use for any reason other than to remit to the appropriately concerned trade union organization without delay.
.The Committee also notes that it has previously examined a similar complaint presented against the Government of Argentina on the failure to transfer the trade union dues deducted by the provincial authorities [see th and nd Reports, Case No. , paras.  and , respectively] and on that occasion it reminded the Government that ""failure to transfer union dues to trade unions may constitute serious interference in trade union affairs"" and it requested the Government ""to take appropriate steps to ensure that, even if the Government of the Province of La Rioja is faced with budget difficulties, the union dues are transferred to the trade union organizations"".
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps without delay to ensure that the competent authorities of Misiones Province immediately transfer to the ATE, in money of legal tender, the amount of the trade union dues of its members that it wrongfully withheld between January  and October , with payment of the corresponding interest.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the",0,2002,Argentina
244,"following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps without delay to ensure that the competent authorities of Misiones Province immediately transfer to the ATE, in money of legal tender, the amount of the trade union dues of its members that it wrongfully withheld between January  and October , with payment of the corresponding interest.",-1,2002,Argentina
245,".The complaints in this case are contained in communications from the Trade Union Association of Judicial Employees of the Province of Crdoba (AGEPJ) and the Argentine Judicial Federation (FJA) dated  July and September . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  April and  July .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications dated  July and September , the Trade Union Association of Judicial Employees of the Province of Crdoba (AGEPJ) and the Argentine Judicial Federation (FJA) explain that, in the framework of a collective dispute in  caused by wage problems that gave rise to amparo proceedings and to protective measures in favour of the members of the AGEPJ, they held assemblies and engaged in industrial action during working hours, as had traditionally occurred in conjunction with the trade union. The complainants point out that while the assemblies were arranged during working hours, they were always held outside the limits or premises of the judicial authority, by virtue of the fact that, in December , the High Court of Justice of the Province of Crdoba, in the framework of another wage dispute, ruled in Order No. , series A, point III to provide for the prohibition, as from the current date, of the holding at premises of the judicial authority of assemblies or meetings of any type. It will be considered a serious offence, punishable by suspension, to participate in, attend or convene meetings, assemblies or mass meetings of this kind? In addition, the highest court in the Province of Crdoba provided in point IV of the Order that shall be prohibited, with the same scope and consequences, any instance of noise that disturbs the normal running of activities in the various courts or establishments of this judicial administration. For transmittal?
.This being the case, and despite the fact that the trade union organization, to protect its members, convened them to meet outside the premises of the judicial authority so as not to violate the abovementioned Order No. , the High Court of Justice, in a further manifestly anti-union stand, notified all participants in the meetings held on  and  March  to answer the charge of having been absent from their workplaces in open contradiction with the internal rules regulating staff attendance and dismissals. Once these charges were answered and involvement confirmed in the assemblies convened by the trade union organization in the framework of the collective dispute in question, the High Court of Justice issued Order No. , series A, dated  March , stating that, ?decides: () to recommend to the officials of the judicial administration that henceforth they abstain from leaving their workplaces to attend trade union assemblies, when they are convened during working hours, under caution of the application of the corresponding penalties ? In other words, not only was it prohibited to hold assemblies on the premises of a judicial authority (Order No. , series A, mentioned above), but it was also prohibited to do so off the premises, during working time, all of which demonstrates the employers systematic conduct to crush any possibility of trade union claims, even trying to destroy the viability of protest against, or the defence of, violated rights; with this logic meaning that sooner or later it will be prohibited to carry out industrial action or strikes during working hours or on working days, leaving the right to defence, assembly, freedom of association and protest limited to Saturdays and Sundays.
.Order No.  of  December , and also Order No. , series A, of  March , weaken and alter the rights and obligations established in the law on trade union associations and its accompanying regulatory decree. They add that the decisions of the judicial authority are unlawful because they regulate unilaterally and arbitrarily the exercise of trade union rights in the matter, which no legislator has done. The changes highlighted affect judicial workers in particular, but also have negative ramifications for all workers and their trade unions who, from now on, face precedents that encourage the restriction of their trade union activities in their respective organizations or state bodies through the procedure referred to.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the law of trade union associations does not confer upon the employer the decision of when and how workers belonging to trade union organizations may exercise their rights. The broad formula used by the law (the right to meet or gather without need for prior authorization) is in keeping with the nature of the labour dispute and safeguards, for each case, the effective exercise of freedom of trade union action. And, while it is true that it does not specify the environment where this right may be exercised, it is also true ?as the decree itself states ?that the fact of not requiring the prior authorization of the employer?refers to the workplace environment, as referring to the environment outside the workplace would mean that the safeguard arose out of the National Constitution itself.
.The complainant organizations indicate that as a consequence of the abovementioned situation, on  April  they requested the intervention of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to resolve the obvious arbitrariness and the serious violation of trade union freedom by the High Court of Justice. File No. .. was opened, wherein the dispute was registered in detail and in which the Ministry decided to summon the parties to a hearing in order to resolve the dispute in some way.
.Faced with these summonses, the High Court of Justice decided, in a decree on  May , to reject categorically the competence of the Ministry of Labour, without there being administrative or legal appeals that can bring this long process of confrontation to a fair conclusion. The decree agreement referred to is Order No. , series A.
.In communications dated  April and  July , the Government states that the dispute relating to wages, mentioned by the complainant organizations, was resolved in accordance with Order No. , series C, of  December  (resolution No. ), to take effect from  January ; it was decided to increase the working day with the subsequent increase in remuneration.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the prohibition to hold meetings during working hours at premises of the judicial authority of the Province of Crdoba, the Government states that this prohibition was regulated by Order No. , series A, of  December . This Order arose as a result of the report submitted by the president of the judicial authority, with respect to the facts that took place on  December  during the morning, at which time, it seems, following a meeting or assembly held by the staff belonging to the Trade Union Association of Judicial Employees of the Province of Crdoba, a group of those present held a noisy march through various departments, arriving at those occupied by the High Court of Justice, initiating there a noisy protest that included personal and verbal attacks against members of the court and other employees or civil servants and thumping on the doors of various offices.
.The Government states that the judicial authority is adamant that all judicial staff must be present in their various workplaces during working hours in which they are open to the public. It should not be forgotten that the judicial authority has its own responsibilities that are essential and cannot be delegated, the performance and efficient achievement of which are principally the responsibility of the High Court of Justice and, because of this, it must apply internal measures that prevent situations that might lead to possible change or deterioration. The principles of efficiency, effectiveness and uninterrupted performance are a unique dimension in the organization of the judicial authority because of the exclusiveness of the public functions that it monopolizes, for which reason the urgent need to guarantee them is increased. For this reason, assemblies of an informative nature or of any other nature convened by the trade union organization, which bring together staff of the judicial authority, can only take place outside working hours.
.Leaving the workplace to attend an assembly means not complying with the duty to be in the workplace and to provide services that are personal and cannot be delegated, which reflect the description of judicial employment. Because of this, the right to meet for trade union reasons can take place without the need for authorization or consent from the employer or work provider only in those cases where these (assemblies) take place outside working hours and, in the specific case of the judicial authority, outside the premises where the departments related to it are located.
.The Government states that the High Court of Justice recognizes the right of judicial workers to meet in assemblies, but this does not mean that it accepts that the labour regulations in force",0,2002,Argentina
246,"with regard to workers in general (and to judicial workers in particular) provide the right to be absent from the workplace during working hours to attend meetings convened by the trade union organization to which they belong. The recognized right of workers to meet and to carry out trade union activities must be interpreted within a reasonable context in accordance with the nature of judicial activity, because, if not, there would be the potential risk that all staff could be absent en masse from their workplace at any time for the reasons mentioned above (to attend assemblies). None of this reasoning has been challenged by the appellants.
.The Government states that, in interpreting Law No.  on trade union associations, the criterion of reasonable conduct that was used does not allow any escaping the fact that the judicial authorities work continuously (in hours laid down by law), as the nature of this administration guarantees all citizens their constitutional right of access to justice.
.The Government adds that judicial employees do have, and are not denied, the right to meet or to attend assemblies convened by the trade union association to which they belong, but that this must take place outside the workplace and outside working hours. The Government also ratifies the constitutional powers of the High Court of Justice to regulate how its services are performed by its employees, based on the judicial doctrine of the High Court of Justice when it upheld that the relations between provincial public employees and the Government upon which they depend are governed by the various provisions of local character that make up the appropriate administrative law?
.Finally, the Government states that the decision taken by the High Court does not violate the provisions of ILO Convention No. . The restriction on holding assemblies in workplaces and during working hours in which they are open to the public has not been imposed to prevent measures of direct action, but only to guarantee continuity and normal performance of judicial services, to create the appropriate conditions for performing essential and necessary services and to allow litigants and members of the public to circulate freely.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations object to two decisions (orders? by the High Court of Justice of the Province of Crdoba in which it was decided to prohibit the holding at the premises of the judicial authority of assemblies or meetings of any type and that recommended that officials of the Judicial Administration abstain from leaving their workplaces to attend trade union assemblies, when they are convened during working hours.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government states that: (i) this prohibition was imposed and regulated in  following a trade union assembly during which a group of participants acted abusively and, specifically, held a noisy march through various departments, including participating in verbal and personal attacks against employees of the High Court of Justice and thumping on the doors of offices; (ii) the judicial authority requires that judicial staff are present in their respective workplaces during working hours in which they are open to the public; (iii) while judicial employees have the right to hold assemblies, this does not mean that they have the right to be absent from their workplaces during working hours when they perform services for the public; and (iv) the restriction on holding assemblies in workplaces and during working hours in which they are open to the public was not imposed to prevent measures of direct action but to guarantee continuity and normal performance of judicial services.
.The Committee recalls that the right to hold meetings is essential for workers?organizations to be able to pursue their activities and that it is for employers and workers?organizations to agree on the modalities for exercising this right. The Committee further recalls that the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ) ?ratified by Argentina ?lays down in Article  that such facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognized public employees?organizations as may be appropriate in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work?and that the granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned? In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to invite the parties to negotiate with a view to achieving agreement on the modalities for the exercise of the right to hold meetings, including the place for such meetings, as well as on the granting of facilities provided for under Article  of Convention No. .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee recalls that the right to hold meetings is essential for workers?organizations to be able to pursue their activities and that it is for employers and workers?organizations to agree on the modalities for exercising this right.(b) The Committee further recalls that the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ) ?ratified by Argentina ?lays down in Article  that such facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognized public employees?organizations as may be appropriate in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work?and that the granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned?(c) In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to invite the parties to negotiate with a view to achieving agreement on the modalities for the exercise of the right to hold meetings, including the place for such meetings, as well as on the granting of facilities provided for under Article  of Convention No. .",4,2002,Argentina
247,".In its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of all new measures adopted in order to remedy the imbalance in the composition of the Supervisory Commission of the National Register of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors and Distributors [see rd Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that the Supervisory Commission has an essentially consultative function and that all the sectors have equal rights, ensuring that there is no imbalance between the different parties. The Government explains that the Supervisory Commission in no way assumes the functions of the appellate authority (the Ministry of Labour), which carries on those functions in full, and that the objective of the legislation in force is to protect workers?rights. The Government states that the Supervisory Commission is made up, on the one hand, of representatives of the publishing sector and, on the other, of representatives of the Trade Union of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors of the Federal Capital, the National Guild Federation and the Society of Newspaper and Magazine Distributors; it is chaired by an official of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security with the rank of Secretary.
.The Committee takes note of these observations
.The Committee last examined this case, which concerns allegations of restrictions of the right to bargain collectively, at its November  meeting when it requested the Government to undertake detailed consultations with the parties concerned with a view to remedying the imbalance in the Supervisory Commission of the National Register of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors and Distributors and to promote free and voluntary collective bargaining between newspaper and magazine vendors?unions and employers in the sector. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard [see nd Report, paras. -].
.In a communication of  January , the Government states that it has communicated the Committees recommendations to the president of the Supervisory Commission of the National Register of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors and Distributors.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee expresses the hope that measures will continue to be taken in order to remedy the imbalance in the composition of the abovementioned tripartite Supervisory Commission. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all new measures adopted in this respect.
.The complaint is contained in a letter from the Trade Union of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors of the Federal Capital and Greater Buenos Aires (SIVENDIA) of September .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its letter of September , the Newspaper and Magazine Vendors Union of the Federal Capital and Greater Buenos Aires (SIVENDIA) states that Decree  of  issued by the national Government, Ministry of Labour resolution  of  and Ministry of the Economy resolution  of  revoked the regime regulating the activity of newspaper and magazine vendors, and made it a commercial activity subject to a system of free competition (not regulated by labour legislation). The complainant organization alleges that the new legislation is in contravention of the national Constitution, the national laws on trade unions and collective bargaining and ILO Conventions Nos. ,  and , and is a flagrant breach of the labour rights of newspaper and magazine vendors and the like and their right to organize and freely and voluntarily negotiate conditions of employment in the sector.
.Specifically, the complainant organization alleges, firstly, that the change from employment to commercial activity converts the workers?engaged in that activity into traders, thereby removing their right to organize and virtually condemning their organization and sister organizations in the sector in the interior of the country to extinction. The complainant states that the predominantly employment nature of the activity was determined by the State itself which in  granted it trade union status (as most representative trade union), in accordance with the conditions and scope of the Trade Unions Act, to defend and represent workers in the newspaper and magazine vending sector.
.In addition, the complainant organization alleges that Decree  of  renders void administrative decisions concerning the sector made by the Ministry of Labour following a process of collective bargaining in the framework of a tripartite commission and also the provisions establishing a framework for collective bargaining, thereby restricting the right to collective bargaining. These decisions laid down provisions on conditions of work, wages and rest and the procedure for recognition of the right to strike and conditions for acquiring, retaining and transferring it.
.In its letter of  May , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security recognizes the right of newspaper and magazine vendors to form trade unions on the basis of historical and legislative considerations without taking into account, exceptionally, of whether workers in the sector were self-employed or employees. Consequently, it granted trade union status to trade unions which applied for it and which satisfied the necessary requirements. In this regard, the Government indicates that the authority responsible for applying these rules (National Directorate of Trade Unions in the Ministry of Labour) approved in March  the granting of trade union registration to the Jujuy Province Union of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors.
.The Government further observes that the rules governing the activity of newspaper and magazine vendors unequivocally presuppose the existence of trade unions in the sector, since, for example, the Control Commission of the National Register of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors and Distributors, established by resolution  of , is made up of representatives of publishers, distributors and the Buenos Aires Union of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors or the Argentine Federation of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors in the case of matters beyond the confines of the city of Buenos Aires.
.The Government points out that the issue in this case is not whether the workers in the sector are self-employed or employees, a matter which it considers outside the ambit of the Committee, but whether they are recognized as having the right to organize. Moreover, the Government reiterates that it has been shown quite clearly that the Ministry of Labour recognizes the existence of trade unions representing workers in the complainant organizations sector and, consequently, the full enjoyment of freedom of association.
.Finally, in its communication of  September , the Government states that the Ministries of Labour and of Production have adopted a joint decision (No.  of April ) which clarifies the differences of interpretation concerning the standards of the sector and helps overcome the divergencies between the sectors concerned. This decision had the support of all members of the Control Commission (including the representatives of the complainent).
.The Committee observes that the allegations in this case concern the imposition of illegal and unconstitutional rules by a decree and administrative decisions regulating the activities of workers in the newspaper and magazine vending sector; exclusion of the right to freedom of association of organizations in the sector; and restrictions on the right to collective bargaining.
.In these circumstances, the Committee is not in a position to examine the question as to the self-employed or employee status of workers in the sector and that its mandate is to establish whether the situation considered in this case is consistent with the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Argentina. In any case, the Committee recalls that by virtue of the principles of freedom of association, all workers ?with the sole exception of members of the armed forces and police ?should have the right to establish and to join organizations of their own choosing. The criterion for determining the persons covered by that right, therefore, is not based on the existence of an employment relationship, which is often non-existent, for example in the case of agricultural workers, self-employed workers in general or those who practise liberal professions, who should nevertheless enjoy the right to organize [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, para. ].
.Moreover, the Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges that the new legislation deprives workers in the sector of the right to organize and condemns the existing organizations to extinction. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government denies this allegation and states that the Ministry of Labour recognizes the right of workers in the sector to form trade unions and has granted trade union status (most representative trade union with exclusive rights to collective bargaining and strike) to various trade unions in the sector. In this regard, the Government adds that recently the National Directorate of Trade Unions approved the granting of trade union registration to another trade union in the sector (the Jujuy Province Union of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors). The Committee also notes the Governments assertion that the rules governing the activity of newspaper and magazine vendors unequivocally presuppose the existence of trade unions in the sector since, for example, the Supervisory Commission of the National",4,2002,Argentina
248,"Register of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors and Distributors, established by the new resolution /, is made up of representatives of publishers, distributors and trade unions in the sector. The Committee considers that in the light of the information provided by the Government, the new regime does not exclude the trade union rights of workers and organizations in the sector and thus, in this regard, is not a violation of the principles of freedom of association.
.Furthermore, as regards the allegations concerning restrictions on collective bargaining, the Committee observes that the complainant states that rules contained in administrative decisions of the Ministry of Labour adopted following a process of bargaining in the context of a tripartite commission (on recognition of the right to strike and conditions for acquiring, retaining and transferring it and provisions on conditions of work, wages and rest) have been revoked and modified. The Committee observes that the Government has not made reference to these allegations. In this respect, although it is not a matter of bargaining in the meaning of Convention No. , since it is a tripartite body (apparently rather a consultative body whose conclusions must be incorporated in an administrative decision to be binding), the Committee requests the Government in future to respect the agreements concluded with the participation of the parties concerned and to refrain from rendering them void by decree and recalls the importance it attaches to the promotion of dialogue and consultations on matters of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative employers?and workers?organizations of the sector involved [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.In addition, with regard to the allegations of restrictions on collective bargaining, the Committee observes that the complainant organization maintains that Decree-Law  which fixed the abovementioned procedure for establishing rules in the sector has been repealed. Indeed, it appears from the information on the legislation sent by the complainant that the former tripartite commission to elaborate and propose a legal regime no longer exists. Instead, a Supervisory Commission of the National Register of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors and Distributors has been created, also tripartite, the functions of which are centred on control?of the regime regulating the activity established in the resolution. This Commission may after five years or when the majority of its members consider it necessary, revise the regime regulating the activity. The Committee observes, however, that the Commission in question is chaired by the administrative authority for labour and consists of a representative of the association of newspaper publishers, a representative of the association of magazine publishers, a representative of the society of newspaper and magazine distributors and a representative of the union of newspaper and magazine vendors. The Committee considers that this composition does not provide the required balance between the trade union and the employers and that this could have a negative impact on the trade unions?confidence in the body. The Committee requests the Government to undertake detailed consultations with the parties concerned with a view to adopting measures to remedy this situation and recalls that, irrespective of this system, trade unions and employers in the sector should be able to engage in free and voluntary collective bargaining concerning their conditions of work. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.
.The Committee takes note with interest of decision No.  by which, according to the Government, the divergencies between the sectors concerned have been overcome. The Committee observes that according to the Government, this decision had the support of all members of the Control Commission, on which the complainant organization is represented.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government in future to respect the agreements concluded with the participation of the parties concerned and to refrain from rendering them void by decree and recalls the importance it attaches to promoting dialogue and consultation on questions of mutual interest between the Government and the most representative employers?and workers?organizations when preparing new legislation in the newspaper and magazine vending sector.(b) As to the alleged restrictions on collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government to undertake detailed consultations with the parties concerned with a view to remedying the imbalance in the Supervisory Commission of the National Register of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors and Distributors and to promote free and voluntary collective bargaining between newspaper and magazine vendors?unions and employers in the sector. It requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.",-1,2002,Argentina

.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  April and  and  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of September , the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Association of State Workers (ATE) allege that sanctions were imposed, in violation of Convention No. , on workers of the town council of the City of Salta by way of Ruling No.  issued by the general directorate of human resources of that municipality, for having participated in a strike convened by the ATE to claim back pay.
.The complainants state that the delay in the payment of wages that occurred at the end of  led to a series of legitimate claims and protests. The conflict worsened and in May  a strike was held to claim the pay corresponding to February, March and April . The measure was decided at an assembly convened by the ATE, the employer and the administrative authority were notified of it, and it had the support of  per cent of the workers.
.Ruling No.  (the text of which was attached to the complaint) imposes one day of suspension with the corresponding deduction in pay for workers who participated in the strike, and constitutes, according to the complainant organizations, a clear violation of Convention No. .
.In its communication dated  April , the Government said that it had submitted the complaint to the relevant provincial and municipal authorities, requesting them to provide their observations. In its communications of September , the Government states that Ruling No. , issued by the general directorate of human resources of the Municipality of the City of Salta (the text of which was attached), set aside Ruling No.  and ordered that the workers in question be reimbursed the deductions made in accordance with it. As the allegation underlying the claim has disappeared the Government considers that this case requires no further action.
.The Committee observes that this case relates to the imposing of a sanction of one days suspension on workers of the town council of the City of Salta by way of Ruling No.  issued by the general directorate of human resources of that municipality, for having participated in a strike convened to claim back pay. The Committee notes with interest the Government statement that Ruling No. , issued by the general directorate of human resources of the Municipality of the City of Salta, set aside Ruling No.  and ordered that the workers in question be reimbursed the deductions made in accordance with it. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the new Ruling is fully implemented.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee notes with interest Ruling No. , issued by the general directorate of human resources of the Municipality of the City of Salta, which sets aside Ruling No.  and orders the reimbursement to workers of the deductions made, and requests the Government to ensure that the new Ruling is fully implemented.",0,2002,Argentina
250,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see rd Report, paras.  to ]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to transmit its observations on the allegation that Mr. Claudio Lepratti, trade union representative of the Association of State Workers, was murdered by police in Rosario City, whilst he was carrying out his professional duty in a school canteen, and to keep it informed of any judicial inquiry undertaken in this respect.
.In its communication of  September , the Government provided a copy of the judgement issued by Criminal Court No.  as regards the proceedings launched against Mr. Esteban Ernesto Velazquez for the murder of Mr. Claudio Lepratti. According to that judgement: () Mr. Velazquez (a policeman) was convicted of aggravated murder, with use of a firearm, and sentenced to  years of prison for homicide; () Mr. Velazquez and the Province of Santa Fe have been jointly sentenced to pay for that crime a compensation of , pesos for pecuniary damages and , pesos for moral damages.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) of May . In a communication of  July , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) supported the complaint. In a communication of  July , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) also supported the complaint.
.The Government sent its observations in communications of  September ,  January,  April,  October  and  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of May , the complainants allege the death, criminal persecution and repression of trade union officers and workers who participated in peaceful social protests. They indicate that, as a result of structural adjustments implemented in the country since the s and deepening social exclusion, many social protests and demonstrations took place from  onwards. One of the methods used was to create roadblocks in which participants generally demanded the creation of jobs, an increase in social spending (especially in the field of education and health) and compliance with agreements concluded with provincial governments and/or the national Government. According to the complainants, the institutional response to social protests was characterized by the repression and criminal persecution of those involved, mainly trade union representatives and activists and unemployed workers. Repression took the form of disproportionate and unjustified force, which left numerous people injured and several people dead. In many cases, the federal courts intervened ordering the repression of demonstrations and were later responsible for conducting the investigations. For all the reported cases of injuries or deaths, the legal investigations are at a standstill and those responsible have not been identified.
.The protests also led to the criminal persecution of demonstrators, and at present over , people are being prosecuted (according to information from the Human Rights Secretariat of the CTA). Those being prosecuted are workers who for the most part are unemployed and extremely poor and, in many cases, unable to put up an effective defence, and for whom the discredit associated with facing prosecution will prevent them from securing work. The majority of cases are still open, thereby prolonging the legal uncertainty of the accused persons.
.The complainants describe the manner in which the social protests are conducted and indicate that, generally speaking, once the road is blocked, a local, provincial or national Government representative appears on the scene with the aim of reaching an agreement with the demonstrators. A document is produced, sometimes in the presence of a prosecutor, and signed by the representatives of workers involved in the demonstration. Subsequently, the signatories are accused of being those criminally responsible in the prosecutions initiated. Therefore, most of the people prosecuted are the trade union officers or social leaders who accompany the demonstrators, as well as representatives designated by the demonstrators.
.The complainants state that certain alternative means of expression, such as peaceful protests, are fundamental for unemployed workers, who do not have the possibility of using methods such as strikes or collective bargaining.
.The CTA details, province by province, numerous cases of repression and criminal persecution. Some of these cases refer to trade unionists, whereas others involve unemployed persons, and the CTA does not provide information on the trade union nature of the action taken by these people, neither does it indicate whether such action was organized by a trade union. Most of the cases refer to roadblocks. The following is a list of the cases referring to trade unionists which involve, or may involve, trade union activities:- Buenos Aires Province: Mr. Sergio Ariel Basterio, General Secretary of the Association of Aeronautical Personnel (APA) and member of the National Executive Committee of the CTA, and Mr. Edgardo Anbal Llano, Deputy Secretary of the Association of Aeronautical Personnel (APA), were prosecuted for allegedly violating section  of the Penal Code (obstructing the highway) as the result of a protest following disputes at the Aerolneas Argentinas enterprise towards the end of .- Autonomous City of Buenos Aires: In the early morning of  April , the Federal Police repressed a demonstration by trade unions affiliated to the Argentine Workers Movement (MTA) who were demonstrating in front of the National Congress for the approval of a labour reform act. Although physical force was used initially to restore the flow of traffic, once this had been done, there was indiscriminate repression and around  people were injured, four of whom with bullet wounds.- Tierra de Fuego Province: Owing to a meeting of health workers, held in January  at the Ro Grande Regional Hospital, security forces committed brutal acts of repression. The intervening judge defined the events as sedition, and the summary proceeding is still under way.- Santa Fe Province: During the social crisis leading up to the resignation of former President Fernando de la Ra, Mr. Claudio Lepratti, trade union representative of the Association of State Workers (ATE), was murdered by police in Rosario city, whilst he was carrying out his professional duty in a school canteen.- Neuquen Province: Mr. Julio Durval Fuentes, General Secretary of the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) of the Neuquen Province, currently has  criminal actions against him and Mr. Csar Abel Sagredo, Deputy Secretary of the Association of State Workers (ATE) of the State of Neuquen, currently has ten criminal actions against him.Mr. Luis Alberto Rodrguez, General Secretary of the Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA) of Zapala city, is accused of committing an offence against public safety for having participated in a protest in Zapala city along with a large group of workers and unemployed persons ().Mr. Alejandro Mansilla is accused of committing an offence against public safety for his participation in a roadblock to demand work for a group of unemployed persons belonging to the CTA ().Messrs. Juan Morales, Oscar Buyones, Jos Antonio Ros, Pablo M. Jimnez, Juan Manuel Sallavedra and Jos Arbajou are accused of committing an offence against public safety for their participation in a roadblock in Senillosa city to demand work for a group of unemployed persons belonging to the CTA ().Mr. Carlos Quintriqueo, General Secretary of the ATE in the Neuquen Province, is accused of violating section  of the Penal Code for his participation in a roadblock held by unemployed persons and workers in Junn de los Andes city ().- Salta Province: Mr. Martn Caliva (General Secretary of the Trade Union of Municipal Employees of Gemes), Mr. Miguel Gamboa, Ms. Miriam de los A. Gonzles, Ms. Cristina del V. Gmez, Ms. Silvia C. Maidana, Ms. Blanca E. Salvatierra (ATE Gemes), Mr. Juan Jos Mendoza, Mr. Eduardo Miranda (Trade Union of Municipal Employees of Gemes) and Mr. David Buenaventura (General Secretary of ATE Salta) are accused of obstructing the highway for their participation in January  in a roadblock held , kilometres along road No.  by municipal employees of General Gemes city to demand the payment of five months owed wages.- Crdoba Province: On  June , a roadblock was held in the Cruz del Eje area to demand the implementation of benefit plans for the unemployed and to denounce the structural poverty prevailing in the north of the province. The provincial police repressed the demonstration, leaving three people injured and three others in detention.- Chaco Province: On  May , the provincial police violently repressed a demonstration by state employees, leaving  people injured and eight in detention.
.In its communications of  September ,  January,  April,  October , and  January , the Government sent information produced by the Interior Security Department of the Ministry of Justice, Security and Human Rights on the situation of the events reported in various provinces. According to this information, at present the new Governments relationship with unemployment movements is one based on dialogue by virtue of the efforts made to reduce unemployment and social exclusion. The Government states that although generally speaking",1,2002,Argentina
251,"the social and employment situation during the previous decade matches the description given by the complainants in some aspects, the priority of the new Government, which took office on  May , is to generate a fairer economy aimed at social inclusion. However, the Government considers that this area does not come under the specific responsibility of the Committee. The Government indicates that specific policies are being applied to reverse the consequences of the social and economic crisis which include the Comprehensive Plan for the Promotion of Employment, the National Plan for Employment Regularization, the Plan for Unemployed Male and Female Heads of Households, and the Plan for Local Development and Social Economy implemented by the Ministry of Social Development. The Government also mentions the establishment of a Committee for Legal Analysis of Social Protests, which is comprised of important figures from various sectors of society, distinguished jurists, officials and social actors and is responsible for assessing different variables so that acts which are not exclusively acts of social protest do not come under criminal law; a Bill has been drawn up for this purpose.
.As regards the various specific events reported, the Government sent the following information concerning the autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the events of  April :As regards the events that occurred during the demonstration in front of the National Congress, it should be mentioned that members of the Argentine Federal Police Force provided security services to safeguard the physical integrity of demonstrators, as well as that of those people not participating in the protest.As events developed, traffic on Avenida Entre Ros, at its intersection with Avenida Rivadavia, was brought to a standstill. For this reason, the prosecutor responsible for contraventions (Fiscala Contravencional) issued an order to clear the road and pavement of the thoroughfare in question, given that the behaviour of the demonstrators was in violation of section  of the Contravention Code?(Cdigo Contravencional) of the City of Buenos Aires.When repeated contact with representatives of the demonstrators with a view to re-establishing the flow of traffic and appeals made to demonstrators through personal dialogue and using loudspeakers did not lead to positive results, security forces started to clear the thoroughfare.During this procedure,  people were detained and proceedings were initiated against them for affronts to and resistance of authority, disobedience, damage, numerous thefts, and injuries? with the intervention of the National Criminal Court of First Instance and the Fifth Federal Correctional Court, under the responsibility of Dr. Gabriel Cavallo, Secretariat No. , Dr. Javiera Gmez Castilla.
.The Committee notes the allegations and the Governments reply which mainly refer to acts of protest by unemployed persons, with the support of trade union officials, using roadblocks to promote their cause. The Committee observes that in numerous cases this action led to confrontations with the authorities and resulted in deaths and injuries. The Committee observes that legal proceedings have been initiated against those participating in the roadblocks and against the police authorities who repressed the protests.
.The Committee observes that these allegations refer to events that occurred up until , and that the new Government indicates that its relationship with unemployed persons?movements is one based on dialogue, given its attempt to generate a fairer economy aimed at social inclusion, and draws attention to a series of specific, relevant policies.
.The Committee underlines that it is unable to determine whether the protests were organized by trade unions as such. The Committee recalls that protests are protected by the principles of freedom of association only when such activities are organized by trade union organizations or can be considered as legitimate trade union activities as covered by Article  of Convention No. . On the other hand, the Committee considers that the complaints, as formulated, do not allow for a determination as to whether the issues raised relating to repression during roadblocks relate to the peaceful exercise of trade union rights as contained in Convention No. , Article , which provides that in exercising the rights provided for in this Convention, workers and employers and their respective organizations, like other persons or organized collectivities, shall respect the law of the land?
.The Committee requests the Government to transmit its observations on the complainants?allegation that Mr. Claudio Lepratti, trade union representative of the Association of State Workers (ATE), was murdered by police in Rosario city, whilst he was carrying out his professional duty in a school canteen. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any judicial inquiry undertaken in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to transmit its observations on the complainants?allegation that Mr. Claudio Lepratti, trade union representative of the Association of State Workers (ATE), was murdered by police in Rosario city, whilst he was carrying out his professional duty in a school canteen.

252,".The complaint is set out in a communication of December  from the Union of Staff and Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration of Salta (SEOAP).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of December , the Union of Staff and Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration of Salta (SEOAP) alleges that the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Labour refused to accept the trade unions application for registration, which had been submitted in May .
.According to the complainant, the registration was refused on the basis of questions and requirements which violated the provisions of Convention No.  in application of an administrative resolution of October  calling for certain requirements to be met (declaration that the statutes submitted had been approved by the assembly, declaration of the members of the executive committee, and confirmation of the employee status of the workers belonging to the trade union) and of another resolution of  September  calling for compliance with two of the previous requirements and of new requirements relating to the trade unions statutes (including elimination of abbreviations which might cause confusion as to the name of the organization; modification of the provisions on refusal of membership of the organization, expulsion or resignation; the lack of precision on the number of members of the provincial executive board; the need for the executive board to be elected by an assembly or extraordinary congress; the need for direct action measures to comply with the law; and the requirement that the trade union could not be dissolved while there was a certain number of members).
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that the Union of Staff and Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration of Salta (SEOAP) duly initiated the process in the Ministry of Labour, requesting registration as a trade union. Under the relevant procedures, the relevant authority requested the complainant to comply with the formal and substantive requirements under Law No.  and its regulatory Decree No. / and additional rules, in order to process the application for registration. Up to now, the complainant has not complied with this request, and thus the registration has not been finalized for reasons outside the Ministry of Labours control and solely attributable to the complainant.
.The Government adds that on no occasion has the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations commented upon Law No. , as concerns section  and others concerning the minimum requirements to be satisfied in an application for registration as a trade union. It can therefore be concluded that the formalities laid down in national regulations on the constitution and functioning of workers?and employers?organizations are consistent with the provisions of Convention No.  and, in the specific case of Argentina, there is no contradiction with the guarantees laid down in this international standard.
.The Government states that the requirements under Law No.  for registration as a trade union, which were not satisfied by the complainant, do not conflict with the principles of freedom of association, and, as mentioned above, have never been the subject of observations by the ILO supervisory bodies. It indicates that the questions to which the complainant objects were as follows: () the constituent act of the trade union and the assembly act approving the text of the trade union statutes do not satisfy the requirements laid down in article  of the administrative rules of procedure; () it is not clear from the text of the assembly act which supposedly approved the statutes what text was actually approved by the assembly; and ()  articles of the statutes presented conflict with the provisions of Law No. , its regulatory decree and additional rules concerning the minimum requirements to be satisfied by trade unions.
.The Government states that the Union of Staff and Workers of the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration of Salta (SEOAP) has not so far complied with these points, despite the fact that the finding was notified personally to its Secretary-General on  November , who stated that the organization would comply. Finally, the Government states that, with consideration to the principle of freedom of association, if the complainant satisfies the minimum requirements laid down in Law No.  and its regulatory Decree No. / for obtaining registration as a trade union, the administrative authority will act accordingly.
.The Committee observes that the Provincial and Municipal Public Administration of Salta (SEOAP) alleges that the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Labour have refused to grant registration as a trade union to this organization since May . According to the complainant, questions and observations which violate the provisions of Convention No.  were used as grounds for not granting registration. (The observations refer to the declaration that the statutes submitted are the text approved by the assembly; the statement concerning the membership of the executive committee; and the certification of the employee status of workers who are members, and various articles of the trade unions statutes on the elimination of abbreviations that might give rise to confusion as to the name of the organization; the modification of the provisions on refusal of membership of the organization, expulsion or resignation of a member; the lack of precision on the number of members of the provincial executive board; the need for the executive board to be elected by an assembly or extraordinary congress; the need for direct action measures to be governed by law; and the need that the trade union should not be dissolved while there was a certain number of members.)
.The Committee observes that the Government states in its reply that: () the relevant authority requested the complainant to comply with the legal requirements under Law No.  and its regulatory Decree No. / and additional rules in order to process the registration; () at no time have the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations or other ILO supervisory bodies objected to the minimum requirements to be met by the application for registration laid down in the current law, which is consequently considered consistent with the provisions of Convention No. ; () up to now the SEOAP has not complied with the observations formulated by the administrative authority (of  September ) which were notified on  November ; and () in general the queries concerning the application for registration refer to problems with the constituent act of the trade union and the act of the assembly which approved the statutes and the contradiction between various articles of the SEOAP statutes and the Trade Unions Act and additional rules.
.In this respect, the Committee considers that the requirements asked of the complainant by the administrative authority to process the trade union registration do not seem to raise problems of compatibility with the principles of freedom of association. However, the Committee regrets that the registration procedure followed in this case has taken so long, partly because the complainant did not comply with the points raised by the administrative authority and in part due to administrative delays.
.Nevertheless, the Committee takes note of the desire to respect the principles of freedom of association and to register the SEOAP as a trade union, provided that the complainant meets the minimum requirements established by Law No.  and its regulatory decree. In these circumstances, the Committee invites the complainant to meet the legal requirements indicated by the administrative authority and expresses the hope that, as affirmed by the Government, once the SEOAP has done so, its registration as a trade union will be quickly realized.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee invites the complainant to meet the legal requirements indicated by the administrative authority and expresses the hope that, as affirmed by the Government, once the SEOAP has done so, its registration as a trade union will be quickly realized.",-1,2001,Argentina

.In its communication of  November , the Government states that these problems have been resolved. Specifically, trade union leave has been regularized, and Resolution No. / of March  ordered the deduction of trade union dues.

.In their communications of ,  and  September,  October and  November , and  March and  May , the Latin American Federation of Workers in Education and Culture (FLATEC) and the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA) state that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security violated the right to strike of education workers by promoting resolution No. /, which qualified state and private education as essential services during the period of compulsory schooling, and resolved to incorporate the action that could be taken in said field into the standards of Executive Decree No. / concerning strikes in essential services (FLATEC sent a copy of the rulings of first and second instance which declared the Decree and the aforementioned ministerial resolution unconstitutional).
.In its communication of  October , the CTERA contests resolution No. / of  October issued by the Ministry of Labour which, based on the stipulations of said resolution No. /, provided that the action to be carried out by the aforementioned organization on  October  should be integrated into the standards of Decree No. / concerning strikes in essential services.
.Lastly, in its communication dated  October , the CTERA alleges that: () the administrative authority of the province of La Rioja has not deducted trade union dues from teachers affiliated to the Association of Teachers and Professors of La Rioja (AMP) since May ; and () on  July , the Secretariat of Educational Development of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the province of La Rioja decided to suspend the granting of trade union leave (granted by resolution No.  of  April ) and/or secondments requested by the AMP until said organization duly demonstrated that it had been granted legal trade union status by the Ministry of Labour.
.In its communication of  August , the Government states with regard to the allegations concerning resolution No. / of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and Executive Decree No. / that the Argentine Trade Union of Private Tutors (SADOP) filed an action for amparo (enforcement of constitutional rights) before the courts requesting a precautionary measure to prevent the Decree and aforementioned resolution from being enforced. The Government adds that the judicial authorities approved said action and ordered the Ministry of Labour to abstain from applying said standard to the trade union organization SADOP and the education workers it represents.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations contest resolutions (Nos. / and /) of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security which include the sector of education in the essential services regulated by Executive Decree No. /. In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government states that the judicial authority declared that resolution No. / was unconstitutional when qualifying the sector of education as an essential service. Furthermore, the Committee observes that contested resolution No. / was based on resolution No. /, which, as already pointed out, was declared unconstitutional. The Committee recalls that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited: () in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State; or () in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) and that the education sector does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ].
.As regards the allegations, according to which: () the administrative authority of the province of La Rioja has not deducted trade union dues from teachers affiliated to the Association of Teachers and Professors of La Rioja (AMP) since May ; and () on  July  the Secretariat of Educational Development of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the province of La Rioja decided to suspend the granting of trade union leave (granted by resolution No.  of  April ) and/or secondments requested by the AMP until said organization duly demonstrated that it had been granted legal trade union status by the Ministry of Labour, the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not sent its observations; the Committee requests the Government to take measures to conduct an investigation into the alleged events and, if these allegations and their anti-union nature prove to be true, to take the necessary measures to restore the deduction of trade union dues and guarantee the enjoyment of trade union leave.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Regretting that the Government has not sent its observations, the Committee requests it to take measures to conduct an investigation into the allegations concerning the failure to deduct trade union dues from AMP members and the denial of trade union leave to AMP officials and, if these allegations and their anti-union nature prove to be true, to take the necessary measures to restore the deduction of trade union dues and guarantee the enjoyment of trade union leave.",-1,2001,Argentina
254,".At its November  meeting, the Committee urged the Government to undertake an investigation and requested to be kept informed about the alleged non-renewal of the contracts of  cabin crew employees in reprisal for the refusal by one of the complainant organizations, the Asociacin Argentina de Aeronavegantes (AAA), to accept a framework agreement. The Committee also asked the Government, if it was found that this non-renewal was linked to the exercise of trade union rights, to draw the necessary conclusions with a view to the possible renewal of those contracts [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that the situation has returned to normal, and this has been confirmed by the complainant organization (the AAA).
.The Committee notes this information with interest.
.The complaints in the present case are contained in a communication dated  May  from the Asociacin Argentina de Aeronavegantes (AAA) and a communication of June  from the General Confederation of Labour of the Argentine Republic (CGT). The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their respective communications of  May and June , the Asociacin Argentina de Aeronavegantes (AAA) and the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) objected to resolution No. /, passed by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Human Resources Training under the terms of Act No. , which required all trade unions and undertakings in the sector in question to form negotiating committees with a view to modifying the collective agreements in force; a framework agreement was proposed at the same time. According to the complainants, the authorities have forced the trade unions to accept new collective labour agreements while denying them the right to defend acquired rights.
.The Asociacin Argentina de Aeronavegantes also states that, in view of its refusal to accept the new framework agreement, Aerolneas Argentinas S.A. decided not to renew the employment contracts of  cabin crew employees. Lastly, the complainant states that the Ministry of Labour passed resolution No. / requiring the company to regularize the situation of the employees in question (a copy of the resolution is supplied with the complaint).
.In its communication of  May , the Government reiterates the observations which it made in the context of Case No.  [see the Committees th Report, paras. -] on resolution No. / and Act No.  to which the complainants have objected. To summarize, the Government emphasizes that: () given the fact that that the company had claimed to be in crisis, which meant that it could not continue to operate with the same number of employees as before, and since dismissals had begun in the sector, the Ministry of Labour did all that was legally in its power to revoke the dismissals that had taken place and to preserve jobs in the company; and () the authorities did not suspend or annul the existing agreement between the parties by decree or suspend contracts that had already been negotiated, nor did they cancel collective agreements and impose renegotiation; on the contrary, the procedure to which the complainants have objected is intended to harness and promote collective bargaining in crisis situations with a view to avoiding unilateral solutions that are detrimental to jobs. It should also be noted that at no time was the autonomy of the parties concerned compromised. If the parties fail to reach an agreement, the matters in dispute are not settled through compulsory arbitration by the labour authorities (unless the parties seek such arbitration by consensus).
.Lastly, the Government states that in December , the company Aerolneas Argentinas S.A. attended insolvency proceedings, and in this context collective talks began, a three-year collective agreement having been concluded by the Asociacin Argentina de Aeronavegantes (AAA), among other sector unions.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainants object to resolution No. / of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Human Resources Training, which was passed under the terms of Act No. , by which the Government, in view of the economic crisis facing Aerolneas Argentinas S.A., called on all the sector unions and the company in February  to establish negotiating committees to modify the collective agreements in force, and also proposed a framework agreement. The Government notes that the complainant alleges that, since it did not accept the proposed framework agreement, the company Aerolneas Argentinas S.A. in reprisal decided not to renew the employment contracts of  cabin crew employees.
.The Committee notes that, when it examined a previous complaint at its March  meeting, it formulated certain comments on the ministerial resolution and the Act to which the complainants have objected. The Committee also notes that the Government reiterates the arguments which it put forward on that occasion. Under the circumstances, the Committee refers to its conclusions regarding the previous complaint in question [see th Report, Case No. , para. ]:Moreover, the Committee considers that Act No.  and resolution ST No. / establish consultation machinery to achieve solutions by consensus to crisis situations and do not oblige the parties to renegotiate the terms of collective agreements. Therefore the Committee will not continue its examination of the allegations.
.As regards the allegation that the company decided not to renew the contracts of  cabin crew employees in reprisal for the refusal by one of the complainants (AAA) to accept a framework agreement, the Committee notes that the Government passed resolution No. / which states that the Ministry has an obligation to do its utmost to maintain social peace and protect employment, and must therefore adopt all necessary measures to resolve the present dispute? and that it is appropriate to require the employer to regularize the situation of the employees in question, in the conviction that this will help to remove the obstacles to agreements that would resolve their differences? The Committee urges the Government to undertake an investigation of this matter and, if it is found that the non-renewal of the contracts of the  employees was linked to the exercise of trade union rights, to draw the necessary conclusions with a view to the possible renewal of those contacts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this matter.

255,".The complaint is set out in a communication from the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) dated  June . The Government submitted its reply in the communication of  December .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) claims that the Fishing and Allied Workers?Union (SIPES) was established as a trade union association on  July  with the aim of bringing together workers involved in the fishing and related industries from the entire coastline situated within the national territory. Despite the fact that this trade union has more than  members and tried to obtain legal trade union status in accordance with the regulations of Act No. , the authorities (the Ministry of Labour) refuse to grant this request claiming that it is absolutely essential to guarantee dependent employment relationships?in the sector, along with the respective wage receipts granted by the employer. The complainant points out that it has become impossible to meet this requirement owing to the characteristics of the affiliated employees (see below). This is preventing the trade union in question from exercising its right to represent and defend its members within national territory, in flagrant violation of Convention No. . Furthermore, the trade union is being denied the right to establish representation committees in enterprises.
.The complainant organization explains that only  per cent of the workers involved in manufacturing in Buenos Aires have a dependent employment relationship. The remaining  per cent work through the fraudulent outsourcing of cooperative associations, which are established by the very employers in the sector with the aim of lowering labour costs in the difficult economic circumstances.
.The CTA explains that according to Argentinian law, workers (or service providers) are indirect employees of the beneficiary of the service?(when intermediary recruitment is legitimate) and direct employees when the recruitment process is fraudulent. In either case, the beneficiary of the service must meet all labour and social security standards for workers with dependent employment relationships.
.To deal with the abovementioned elusive practice, continues the complainant, the State adopted various (but partial) measures to address this fraudulent situation. For example, the National Executive Power Decree No. / and the National Institute of Cooperative Action Resolution No. / suspended the granting of trade union registration to labour cooperatives?to give less leeway for labour fraud. However, employers continued to recruit their workforce through intermediaries, which are still irregular?and only exist because of the distressing situation of workers and various forms of pressure. In response to the aforementioned administrative provision, another strategy used by employers was to hire?the registration details of cooperative associations.
.The recent adoption of Act No. , section , of which confirms the power of the State Police to detect labour fraud, could be included as a measure taken to monitor the abovementioned situation, but it is completely ineffective in practice owing to its bothersome bureaucracy.
.However, for social security purposes, resolutions were issued by the General Directorate of Taxation such as Resolution No. / which considers the mediation of cooperative associations to be fraudulent (When the social objective and purpose of such associations focus on the provision of a labour force to third parties, the workers should be considered to be dependent and, therefore, contributors to the respective social security system?. As a result, the diverse and so-called cooperative associations that are proliferating, namely those which are merely borrowed names or frontmen, adopted various techniques, such as changing their name or widening their statutory objective to include production?
.In its communication of  December, the Government declares that the SIPES has on no occasion made any request to the administrative authority for trade union registration and/or legal trade union status. In this respect, the allegations are completely false since there is no factual substance to them whatsoever. This highlights the dishonesty of the complainant organizations and the abusive use of the procedure.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that the authorities refuse to grant legal trade union status to the Fishing and Allied Workers?Union (SIPES) claiming that it is absolutely necessary that dependent employment relationships exist in this sector, whereas in reality only  per cent of workers in the fish manufacturing sector have dependent employment relationships and  per cent of them are enrolled in the fraudulent outsourcing system of cooperative associations established to lower labour costs and in which employers recruit their workforce through intermediaries.
.The Committee notes that according to the Government, the SIPES has not requested the authorities for trade union registration or legal trade union status. The Committee concludes that this case does not require a more detailed examination unless the complainant organizations provide specific information in this respect.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not require a more detailed examination unless the complainant organizations provide specific information in this respect.",0,2001,Argentina
256,".The complaint submitted by the Association of State Workers (ATE) is contained in a communication dated February . The Government forwarded its observations in a communication of  July .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of February , the Association of State Workers (ATE) states that Act  ratifies Convention No.  and Act / ratifies Convention No.  and that articlebis of the Argentinian constitution guarantees the right to collective bargaining as a fundamental right. Likewise, the complainant indicates that the Constitution establishes the representative, republican and federal system and provides, moreover, that each provincial state has legislative powers and that the procedure and holding of collective bargaining for public administration must be legislated in keeping with the existing normative framework. The Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires, article , paragraph ), explicitly provides for the right to collective bargaining for public officials of the province.
.The ATE alleges that, on  January , the Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires vetoed the Act adopted by the legislature (provincial legislative power), under file /-. According to the complainant, the Act that was vetoed conformed in every way with national Act  on collective bargaining in the national public sector and with Convention No. . The Act covers employees of the provincial public administration as well as those of the legislature and the judiciary, and of the Instituto de Obra Mdico Asistencial (IOMA) and the Social Security Institute, both of which are tripartite public administration bodies funded by the provincial budget.
.The complainant states that Decree No. / which vetoes the Act legally adopted by the provincial legislature and which, by extension, prevents its application, constitutes an act of outright interference by the provincial administrative authority in matters pertaining to collective bargaining by public officials of the Province of Buenos Aires and is, therefore, an infringement of the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining.
.In its communication dated  July , the Government states that under Decree No. /, article , and under the powers vested in it by article  of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires, the government of the province decided to veto the law adopted on  December  by the legislature, regulating collective agreements for public officials of Buenos Aires.
.The Government states, in response to the allegation that Decree No. / constitutes an act of outright interference by the provincial administrative authorities in collective bargaining by public officials in the Province of Buenos Aires and is, therefore, a breach of the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining, that the veto was issued on unassailable legal grounds, in accordance with current provincial public law whereby promulgation of the vetoed Act was clearly inadmissible, first and foremost because it infringed the executives so-called reserve zone? by seeking to place the constitutional powers of a branch of state power within the ambit of collective agreement. The Government emphasizes that the possible existence of a breach in connection with Decree No. / should be dismissed, both in terms of constitutional principles and norms and of the international conventions in question.
.The Government states that the Act contained irreparable material flaws, making valid enforcement impossible within the current federal and provincial order in Argentina. Specifically, the Government states that the flaws involve the scope of personal application of the Act; matters of trade union representation and administrative authority; restrictions on participation in collective bargaining by given trade union organizations; the content of collective bargaining (according to the Government, the Act places powers inherent in the provincial executive within the ambit of collective agreement); unequal treatment in terms of the duty to provide information; the levying of a trade union solidarity fee on employees, even if they are not members of workers?organizations and conflict prevention and settlement mechanisms.
.Lastly, the Government states that the veto was imposed under constitutional powers vested in the provincial executive, of an exclusive nature that cannot be delegated, relating to operational and implementation matters which must ultimately be settled by the State, and which the ILO Conventions in question likewise attribute to national legislation and practice and which in no way constitute an anti-trade union attitude and much less a violation of the principle and implementation of free and voluntary collective bargaining.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant objects to Decree No. / issued by the executive of the Province of Buenos Aires, vetoing a provincial Act regulating collective agreements for public officials which, according to the complainant, conforms in every respect to national law on collective bargaining in the public sector and with Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that this constitutes an act of outright interference by the provincial administrative authority in matters pertaining to collective bargaining by public officials of the Province of Buenos Aires and is, therefore, an infringement of the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining.
.In this regard, the Committee takes note that the Government states that: () under the powers vested in it by article  of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires, the government of the province decided to veto the law regulating collective agreements for public officials of the province; () the veto was issued on unassailable legal grounds, in accordance with current provincial public law whereby promulgation of the vetoed Act was clearly inadmissible, first and foremost because it infringed the executives so-called reserve zone? by seeking to place the constitutional powers of a branch of state power within the ambit of collective agreement; () the flaws involve the scope of personal application of the Act; matters of trade union representation and administrative authority; restrictions on participation in collective bargaining by given trade union organizations; the content of collective bargaining (according to the Government, the Act places powers inherent in the provincial executive within the ambit of collective agreement); unequal treatment in terms of the duty to provide information; the levying of a trade union solidarity fee on employees, even if they are not members of workers?organizations and conflict prevention and settlement mechanisms; and () the veto does not constitute an anti-trade union attitude and much less a violation of the principle and implementation of free and voluntary collective bargaining.
.Firstly, the Committee emphasizes that it is not up to the Committee to give an opinion on the decision by a national or provincial government to veto an Act by a national or provincial legislature.
.In regard to the right to collective bargaining of public officials in the Province of Buenos Aires, the Committee notes that Argentina ratified Convention No. , in , whereby public officials who are not engaged in the administration of the State should enjoy the right to collective bargaining and that, through ratification of Conventions No. , in , and No. , in , this right has been recognized in general for all public officials. Under these circumstances, and bearing in mind that collective bargaining in the public administration provides for the establishment of specific application modalities, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to respect the right to collective bargaining of public officials in the Province of Buenos Aires, in accordance with the provisions of Conventions Nos. ,  and  and reminds the Government that it may request the technical assistance of the Office in drafting a new bill for such employees.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Taking into account that the right to collective bargaining has not been granted to workers in the public sector in the Province of Buenos Aires, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to respect the right to collective bargaining of these public sector workers in the Province of Buenos Aires, in accordance with the provisions of Conventions Nos. ,  and  and reminds the Government that it may request the technical assistance of the Office in drafting a new bill for such employees.",0,2001,Argentina
257,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras. -].
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the Committee examined this case at its November  meeting, there remained pending allegations presented by the Aviation Technicians?Association of the Argentine Republic (APTA) challenging Ministry of Labour Resolution No. /, promulgated under sections  ff. of the Employment Act, No. , ordering the APTA to renegotiate the content of collective agreements governing the employment relationship between its members and the enterprises Aerolneas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lneas Areas-Cielos del Sur S.A. According to the APTA, it is being obliged to renegotiate an administrative programme to prevent unemployment in the sector, the impact of production restructuring on conditions of work and employment, and vocational retraining and reintegration measures for the workers affected. On that occasion the Committee had noted that the Government had sent its observations in a communication dated  October  and proposed to examine these allegations at its next meeting [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that Act No.  of  December , pursuant to which Resolution ST No. / was adopted, allows the Ministry of Labour ?at the request of the parties concerned or on its own initiative ?to declare production restructuring in enterprises that are affected or are likely to be affected by significant reductions in employment, convening the social partners to collective bargaining in the negotiating committee of the branch collective agreement (section  of the Act). Specifically, the Act provides for negotiation on the following issues: administrative programmes to prevent unemployment in the sector; impact of production restructuring on conditions of work and employment; and measures for vocational retraining and reintegration of the workers likely to be affected. This legislation dates back to December , has been applied on a number of occasions and has never been challenged in any way.
.The Government adds that Aerolneas Argentinas is a private enterprise in the aviation sector numbering approximately , employees. It is a well-known fact that airlines throughout the world are in the midst of a crisis and many of them have drastically cut back their staff. In the case of Aerolneas Argentinas S.A. certain frequencies and routes have been cut and substantial staff cutbacks are envisaged. In view of the imminence of the crisis invoked by the enterprise, which will prevent it from continuing to operate with present staff levels, and lay-offs having already begun in the sector, the Ministry of Labour carried out all the procedures legally within its power to reverse the lay-offs that had occurred and preserve employment in the enterprise.
.The Government states that the Ministry of Labour did not suspend or repeal by decree the agreement between the parties, neither did it terminate contracts that had already been negotiated, nor did it cancel collective agreements or oblige the parties to renegotiate them; on the contrary, the procedure challenged by the complainant was aimed at providing a framework for and promoting collective bargaining in situations that were undeniably critical in order to avoid unilateral solutions that would be detrimental to jobs; in no case was the free will of the parties impaired or coerced. If the parties fail to reach an agreement, the points at issue are not settled through compulsory arbitration by the labour authority. This is evidenced by the fact that the framework agreement appended to Resolution ST No. / (which sought to ensure stability of at least two years for the workers of the enterprises concerned) has not been signed by two of the seven unions in the branch and therefore did not enter into force, and hence the applicable collective agreements have remained in force and no new agreements or new amendments of existing agreements have been negotiated to date.
.The Government explains that intervention by the administrative authority in cases such as the present one is aimed solely at creating an enabling environment for bargaining when employment in a given sector is likely to be affected by extraordinary circumstances such as restructuring and crisis situations. The Government further emphasizes that this procedure does not suspend or rescind collective agreements that are in force; on the contrary, the free will of the parties is fully exercised in reaching solutions by consensus that seek to avoid the scourge of unemployment. It is not even a matter of renegotiating existing agreements. The procedure laid down in Act No.  does not go to these extremes, since, as pointed out above, it is aimed at providing a framework for collective bargaining in situations likely to have a serious impact on employment, but neither suspends nor rescinds collective agreements in force. It cannot, by any description, be viewed as infringing freedom of association and/or the right to collective bargaining.
.Lastly, the Government points out that the SEPI (majority shareholder of the enterprises at the time the complaint was presented) transferred its shares on  October  to the Air Comet group, which stated its intention to maintain stability for all employees for at least two years, guarantee the operating capacity of the enterprise and restore the routes and frequencies that had been cut.
.The Committee observes that when it examined this case at its November  meeting, there remained pending allegations presented by the Aviation Technicians?Association of the Argentine Republic (APTA) challenging Ministry of Labour Resolution No. / adopted under sections  ff. of the Employment Act, No. , ordering the APTA to renegotiate the content of collective agreements governing the employment relationship between its members and the enterprises Aerolneas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lneas Areas-Cielos del Sur S.A. According to the APTA, the association was obliged to renegotiate an administrative programme to prevent unemployment in the sector, the impact of production restructuring on conditions of work and employment, and vocational retraining and reintegration measures for the workers affected.
.The Committee notes that the Government states that: () Act No.  allows the Ministry of Labour to declare production restructuring in enterprises that are affected or are likely to be affected by significant reductions in employment, convening the social partners to collective bargaining in the framework of the negotiating committee of the branch collective agreement. Specifically, provision is made for negotiation on administrative programmes to prevent unemployment in the sector; the impact of restructuring on conditions of work and employment; and measures for vocational retraining and reintegration of the workforce likely to be affected; () Aerolneas Argentinas is a private enterprise in the aviation sector numbering approximately , employees, and it is a well-known fact that airlines throughout the world are in the midst of a crisis. In view of the imminence of the crisis invoked by the enterprise, and lay-offs having already begun in the sector, the Ministry of Labour carried out all the procedures aimed at reversing the lay-offs that had occurred and preserving employment in the enterprise; () the Ministry of Labour did not suspend or repeal by decree either agreements between the parties or collective agreements; rather the procedure was aimed at providing a framework for and promoting collective bargaining in situations that were undeniably critical in order to avoid unilateral solutions; the framework agreement appended to Resolution ST No. / was not signed by two of the seven unions in the sector and hence did not enter into force; and therefore the applicable collective agreements remained in force and no new agreements have been negotiated to date; and () the SEPI, the majority shareholder of the enterprises at the time the complaint was presented, transferred its shares on  October  to the Air Comet group, which expressed its intention to maintain stability of all employees for at least two years, guarantee the operating capacity of the enterprise and restore the routes and frequencies that had been cut.
.In these circumstances, the Committee hopes the relations between the complainant and the Air Comet group will be constructive. Moreover, it considers that Act No.  and Resolution ST No. / establish consultation machinery to achieve solutions by consensus to crisis situations and do not oblige the parties to renegotiate the terms of collective agreements. Therefore the Committee will not continue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaints are contained in communications by the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and by the National Civil Servants?Union (UPCN) dated  August  and October  and by the Asociacin del Personal Tcnico Aeronutico de la Republica Argentina (APTA), dated  March .
.The Government transmitted observations in communications of  July and  October .

258,"(No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  August and October , the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the National Civil Servants?Union (UPCN) state their opposition to Decree / issued by the National Executive which imposes a wage reduction on national civil service employees, decentralized bodies, state limited liability companies, national banks and other bodies under the auspices of the national State, thus constituting a breach of the applicable labour regimes, regardless of whether the employment relationship is governed by duly approved public sector collective agreements, by legislation governing employment contracts or by collective labour agreements signed under the normative framework of Act  and its amendments.
.Article  of Decree / provides that:A reduction is hereby introduced in the gross, total, monthly, normal, regular and permanent remuneration, and complementary annual wage, excluding family benefits, for national civil service employees included in article , paragraphs (a) and (b) of Act , including official banking entities and the armed and security forces and the federal police and national legislature, regardless of the labour regime applicable to such employees Article  provides that:The reduction in remuneration provided for in the previous article shall apply to the total of components of such remuneration, in accordance with the following scale:Under , pesos  per cent reductionOver , and under ,  per cent reductionOver ,  per cent reduction
.The CGT and UPCN further allege that the State signed the first collective agreement for the national civil service in January , which provides that the Government undertakes to guarantee stability of position and function of civil servants, including, among other rights, normal, regular and permanent remuneration corresponding to the grade in question. The agreement provides moreover for the establishment of the Standing Commission for Application and Labour Relations, to carry out mediation and dispute settlement. This agreement is currently in force. The complainants further state that the First Sectoral Negotiating Commission agreed on a wage increase for level F of the SINAPA (Sistema Nacional de la Profesin Administrativa), ratified by resolution / of the National Ministry of Labour.
.The CGT and UPCN allege moreover that the Government issues an emergency decree to reduce earnings by a significant percentage (the Decree provides for a reduction of  per cent for the lowest wage brackets and of  per cent for the higher brackets), and failed to activate the consultation mechanisms provided for in the collective agreement.
.In its communication of  March , the Asociacin del Personal Tcnico Aeronutico de la Repblica Argentina (APTA) alleges that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Human Resource Training, under resolution ST /, ordered the association to renegotiate collective agreements with the companies Aerolneas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lneas Areas-Cielos del Sur S.A. in regard to the following matters: (a) an administrative programme to preclude unemployment in the sector; (b) the impact of production restructuring on conditions of work and of employment; and (c) vocational retraining and reintegration of affected employees.
.In its communication dated  July , the Government states that contested Decree / was revoked by Decree  of  July . It adds that Decree / was adopted for reasons of economic emergency and fiscal pressure necessitating prompt and effective action to alleviate the negative effects of Argentinas extremely difficult financial and budgetary situation. The Government adds that Decree / introduced wage reductions exclusively for the upper echelons of the administration (salaries over , pesos) whose remuneration was not fixed by collective agreement. The Government further states that agreement in regard to level F was respected and did not fall within the bracket affected by Decree /.
.In a communication dated  October , the Government forwarded complementary observations concerning the APTAs complaint.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations, CGT and UPCN challenge Decree / issued by the Executive Power, providing for a reduction in the wages of national public administration employees, and allege that the Decree breaches the provisions of the first collective agreement for the national civil service sector concluded between the UPCN and the Government in January  and that the consultation mechanisms established under that agreement were not respected.
.In regard to Decree / contested by the complainants and the alleged breach of the collective agreement concluded between the UPCN and the State, the Government states that: () the Decree in question has been revoked; () the Decree was originally adopted for reasons of financial emergency and fiscal pressure; () the Decree provided for reductions affecting only the upper echelons of the administration (over , pesos) and that such remuneration fell outside the agreement which is alleged to have been breached; and () level F of SINAPA was not affected by the Decree.
.In this regard, the Committee notes the emergency situation referred to by the Government leading to the issue of Decree /, and that the remuneration subject to reduction had not been fixed by collective agreement. Nonetheless, the Committee points out that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by full and detailed consultations with the appropriate organizations of workers and employers,?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that whenever it intends to adopt new decrees or provisions affecting the interests of workers, consultations be carried out with the most representative worker organizations of the sector in question.

.In their communication of December , the National Federation of University Teaching Staff (CONADU) and the Riojan Association of University Teaching Staff (ARDU) from the province of La Rioja allege anti-union practices, trade union persecution and the violation of national and international protective standards by the National Executive Power and the authorities of the National University of La Rioja (UNLaR). More specifically, the complainants allege that on  February  the Board of Governors of the UNLaR ordered that an academic proceeding be initiated against the teacher Estela Cruz de Garca in her capacity as trade union representative (Secretary General of ARDU) on the grounds of the exercise of her trade union representation work; it was also decided to order CONADU to rectify alleged statements made concerning the university authorities. The UNLaR based this decision on an article that appeared in the local daily newspaper El Independiente on  February , and in which ?in view of the virtual non-existence at the UNLaR of teaching staff who belong to CONADU and ARDU, we have observed the persistence of a campaign to discredit and undermine this university by the teacher Estela Cruz de Garca, in terms that go beyond the healthy principles of democratic coexistence and the exercise of rights?
.According to the complainants, initiating academic proceedings, an administrative procedure intended to remove the trade union representative on the grounds of her trade union activities, solely on the basis of the above quotation, clearly constitutes a violation of the guarantees that protect trade union activities and the stability of the delegate in question. Also, the academic proceedings stipulated in the resolution were initiated without any type of notification or right to defence. CONADU was not notified of the order contained in article  of the administrative act.
.The complainants emphasize that the resolution issued by the Board of Directors of the UNLaR is based on a newspaper publication. From the records it does not appear that the administrative and employing authority has checked the source of the information or the veracity of its content. Neither CONADU or the teacher Ms. Cruz were ever required to ratify or rectify the information, thus damaging the guarantee of defence and making the act voidable as it lacks cause and foundation de facto and de jure. Also, the basis for the discriminatory resolution is in short that ?we have observed the persistence of a campaign to discredit and undermine this university by the teacher Estela Cruz de Garca ? but at no time has the content of that campaign been clearly established. It is in fact nothing more than the regular exercise of the rights which Ms. Cruz is entitled to in her capacity as trade union representative. Under the National Constitution (article bis), Union representatives shall have the necessary guarantees to perform their union tasks and to ensure the stability of their employment? This stipulation is operative as it is directly established by the Constitution and is not conditional on any regulation.
.In its communication of  December , the Government refers to the observations made by the UNLaR, which declares that it is absolutely foolhardy and incomprehensible, as well as being legally indefensible, to accuse an autonomous and autarchic institution of persecuting a trade union official, or of engaging in anti-union practices simply because it initiates academic proceedings against a teacher in the framework of the most absolute legality and institutional legitimacy. In this respect, provision is made for academic proceedings both in the statutes of the university (articles  to  inclusive) and in the Higher Education Act No.  (article ), in coinciding and coordinated terms. Furthermore, the statutes of the UNLaR, which are attached, make provisions for both the composition of the academic tribunal, which corresponds to the provisions of the Higher Education Act (article ), the guarantee of the right to defence (article ), the obligation to give reasons for the pronouncement (article , first part) and the possibility of appealing the decision adopted before the university assembly (article  in fine). Likewise, while the academic proceedings were initiated on the basis of the Board of Directors resolution No. / referred to in the complaint, they were certainly not based solely on the sentence quoted by the complainants (?in view of the virtual non-existence at the UNLaR of teaching staff who belong to CONADU and ARDU, we have observed the persistence of a campaign to discredit and undermine this university by the teacher Estela Cruz de Garca, in terms that go beyond the healthy principles of democratic coexistence and the exercise of rights ?, but on the manifest existence of a campaign to discredit the university which, in the words of the pronouncement made by the Board of Governors of the university, goes beyond the healthy principles of democratic coexistence and the exercise of rights? Lastly, and as shown below, the grounds motivating this decision were not restricted and did not only comprise only one newspaper article. This is clear from the content of Board of Governors resolution No. / and also from other facts expressly invoked that can be cited as follows:?this decision by the trade union entity, on the basis of the report by Ms. Estela Cruz de Garca, a member of ARDU, demonstrates a complete ignorance of the standards that regulate the Argentine university system, and in particular those that regulate this university; they seek to question and challenge the decisions legitimately adopted by the collegiate bodies of the UNLaR, which are comprised of representatives of the university bodies. The UNLaR community defined an institutional project and the person chosen to present it won over  per cent of the vote by members of the university assembly in July , which demonstrates the absolute collective conviction which endorses the decisions of its governing bodies. The UNLaR has clearly and consistently formulated its educational policy to ensure increasing levels of quality and excellence?(article (d) of Act No. ) to intensify the process of democratization in higher education to contribute to the equitable distribution of knowledge and to ensure equal opportunities?(article (d) of Act No. ), in the framework of the true transformation that society and the world demand of institutions of higher education ?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.Furthermore, the initiation of academic proceedings cannot in any way be taken to signify the restriction or infringement of freedom of association, nor opposition to the trade union leadership, even if it is not covered by an indemnity bill?or by special protection under the applicable national or international legislation. The fact remains that any teacher can be questioned about ethical/disciplinary matters in accordance with the provisions of the Higher Education Act No.  (article ) which reads as follows: The statutes will provide for the establishment of a university tribunal which will have the function of hearing academic proceedings and deciding on any ethical/disciplinary matters in which teaching staff are involved. It will be constituted of emeritus or consultant professors, or by teaching staff who have won their positions in open competitions and who have over ten years experience in university teaching? It goes without saying that the ethical/disciplinary matters relating to teaching staff must be dealt with by a specific academic tribunal constituted in compliance with the corresponding statutory provision (article (c) and (d) of the UNLaR statutes). An overview of legislation does not reveal any injury or damage associated with the initiation of academic proceedings against a teacher who happens to exercise a trade union function. Furthermore, the academic proceedings initiated, as well as complying fully with prevailing legislation, do not constitute any type of persecution, and certainly not an anticipated sentence, since specific regulations stipulate that they must be decided by a tribunal comprised of peers or colleagues of the actual defendant and it must be possible to appeal the decision, where appropriate.
.It should also be pointed out that the current stage of the proceedings, in accordance with the provisions governing them, and as specified in an attached document, far from signifies an inquisitorial procedure or a prejudgement of the conduct of Ms. Estela Cruz de Garca. Nevertheless, there has not yet been any response regarding the report submitted to El Independiente, and once this is done, the article published by this newspaper on  February  will either be substantiated or not. This, together with the other proceedings, will show whether the academic tribunal is justified or not in approving the academic proceedings requested of the tribunal by the Board of Governors, in accordance with the provisions of article  of the statutes of the UNLaR.
.Without prejudice to the fact that article  of the statutes of this organization expressly determines that: In all instances the right of defence of the accused will be duly ensured? it must also be stated that from the time she took up the position of",5,1999,Argentina
260,"Secretary General of ARDU, Ms. Estela Cruz de Garca generated a campaign of ongoing slander against the university and its authorities, announcing non-existent and unfounded institutional situations that were never corroborated. By way of example, an article in El Independiente dated  December  reports, on this record?(a different article to that mentioned in the Board of Governors?resolution). The matter denounced on that occasion is false, as also proved to be false ?according to a judicial decision ?alleged improper salary deduction which could have been detrimental to Ms. Cruz de Garca. Her claim was rejected by the federal judge of La Rioja (a certified photocopy of the decision is attached). In this same context mention should be made, as it is linked to the same slander, of the formal request made by the rector of the university of Ms. Estela Cruz de Garca and of the members of the executive committee of ARDU, dated  May , to confirm, or otherwise, the remarks deemed by him to be slanderous and offensive, contained in another article in the newspaper El Independiente, dated  May , and published on page  under the title ARDU denounces the UNLaR? a photocopy of which is attached. There was no response to this request. The Government also attaches five other articles published in the same newspaper (the only one in circulation in the provincial capital), containing further false and slanderous accounts.
.In these circumstances, as the academic proceedings initiated against the teacher have not been concluded, nor, as stated by CONADU in its complaint, was there any notification of the Board of Governors resolution No. /, CONADU cannot consider itself to have been wronged by the third provision of that decision ordering it to ratify or rectify its statement (it had declared the rector of the university to be persona non grata?. Nevertheless, the newspaper version has not yet been confirmed. The UNLaR was not notified (and thus this is not contained in the complaint submitted to the ILO) of the application for annulment of the Board of Governors resolution No. /, allegedly requested by CONADU.
.The main proof of the lack of anti-union practices or violations of standards governing the exercise of the collective rights of teachers at the UNLaR can be seen in the entirely normal manner in which the joint academic commission is conducting its business, as demonstrated by recent attached minutes of meetings, and the corresponding decisions taken by the university authorities. This should have been honourably recognized by CONADU since it is fully aware of this matter. However, the unjustified omission by the trade union member of the joint commission in no way detracts from the institutional will of this organization to recognize systematically the collective and individual rights of its workers.
.The Committee observes that the complainants allege that the lodging of academic proceedings against the teacher Estela Cruz de Garca, Secretary-General of ARDU, was an anti-union measure as it was motivated by the exercise of her tasks in the area of trade union representation; they also criticize the order addressed to the trade union organization CONADU to rectify alleged decisions or statements relating to the authorities of the UNLaR. The complainants maintain that these measures do not respect the right of defence, that they are based on a newspaper article ( February ), and that the source of the information has not been confirmed; they mention a campaign to discredit the university being pursued by the teacher in question but do not specify the details of that campaign.
.The Committee notes that in its reply the Government refers to observations made by the UNLaR whereby: () it denies that the lodging of the academic proceedings was an anti-union measure as the statements, and behaviour of the trade union official teacher that led to them, went beyond the healthy principles of democratic coexistence and the exercise of rights; () it stresses that the procedure is being conducted by an academic tribunal comprised of teachers and that there are the appropriate guarantees of the right of defence and there is the possibility to appeal; () legislation provides that academic proceedings can be initiated for matters of an ethical/disciplinary nature; () the current status of the proceedings far from signifies an inquisitorial procedure; () in addition to her statements contained in the press article dated  February , the trade union official teacher conducted a campaign of ongoing slander against the university, inventing non-existent and unfounded institutional situations, denouncing false facts, including alleged improper deductions of her wages which she complained about in , allegations that were also shown to be false (the judicial authority rejected an action in this connection given that it was a matter of an administrative rather than a criminal nature); the university provides the text of this decision and several press articles; () Ms. Cruz de Garca has yet to confirm or not her statements to the newspaper, only then will the academic tribunal be in a position to determine whether there is a legal basis for the academic proceedings requested by the Board of Governors of the university; () the teaching authorities asked that the statements contained in the press article of  February  be rectified owing to their defamatory, slanderous and damaging nature.
.The Committee observes that in the article published in El Independiente on  February  (provided by the Government), the trade union official Ms. Estela Cruz de Garca states that the teachers of the UNLaR did not receive their  pay increase, warns of the possible immediate suspension their participation in exams as a trade union measure and notes that the trade union is examining how to proceed in respect of the improper wage deductions; this article announces that the trade union organization, CONADU, declared the rector of the university to be persona non grata. In the view of the Committee, such statements do not go beyond the normal limits of the right to expression of trade union organizations. The Committee notes that the initiation of academic proceedings by way of a resolution of the Board of Governors of the university was based not only on the statements made in this press article but also on the persistence of a campaign to discredit and undermine this university by the teacher Estela Cruz de Garca, in terms that go beyond the healthy principles of democratic coexistence and the exercise of rights?(resolution of the Board of Governors of the UNLaR dated  February ). The Committee observes that in this resolution, as the complainant indicates, no details are given of the substance of the campaign nor ?apart from the press article dated  February  ?is any reference made to other press articles or to decisions or facts mentioned in the written reply of the university to this Committee. This being the case, the Committee recalls the principle that the right to express opinions through the press or otherwise is an essential aspect of trade union rights?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ], and hopes that the proceedings initiated will guarantee due process and that the conclusions of the investigations will take fully into account the principles of freedom of association
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:As concerns the proceedings initiated against the trade union official Estela Cruz de Garca, the Committee hopes that these proceedings will guarantee due process and that the conclusions of the investigation will take fully into account the principles of freedom of association",1,1999,Argentina
261,".The complaint is contained in communications dated  August,  October and  November  from the Staff Association of the University of Buenos Aires (APUBA). The Government replied in a communication dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  August , the Staff Association of the University of Buenos Aires (APUBA) alleges that, in a context of anti-union and political persecution and an atmosphere of dispute between non-teaching staff and their representatives, on the one hand, and the authorities of the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Town Planning of the University of Buenos Aires (FADU-UNBA), on the other, administrative proceedings were instituted on  November  in respect of the transfer of Ms. Alicia Rosa Di Grazia, a trade unionist who was working in the kindergarten while simultaneously serving as secretary in charge of the records of the Staff Committee. Although she took the matter to court, there has been no final judicial decision to date.
.Moreover, deterioration in the work situation prompted the Workers?Assembly to declare a -hour stoppage of work on  August . Around that same period, the Dean of the Faculty had ordered the institution of two administrative proceedings, on  June and  August  respectively, against Mr. Carlos Guillermo Pelloli, a trade unionist and member of the Staff Committee, on the grounds of sexual harassment? On  September , after a number of irregularities, the trade unionist was transferred, as a preventive measure, and was prohibited from entering the Faculty building. The complainant points out that Mr. Pelloli had made accusations of corruption and of irregularities being committed within the Faculty. In August , further administrative proceedings were instituted in respect of the trade union officer on the grounds that a student of architecture, who was also a member of the Facultys non-teaching staff, had been enrolled in courses of study without observing the course requirements. The complainant states that the Faculty authorities have not complied with the first-instance ruling handed down in December , ordering that Mr. Pelloli be immediately reinstated in his position, or the judgement of the National Labour Appeal Court confirming the first?instance ruling and thus rendering that ruling final and enforceable.
.The complainant also alleges that the Faculty authorities acted to discredit and prejudice Ms. Delia Casal, Delegate-General of the Staff Committee, by instituting administrative proceedings that led to her transfer in violation of her trade union rights, and by attempting to implicate fellow trade unionist Mr. Carlos Pelloli and Ms. Elsa Casal, a member of the Facultys non-teaching staff and the sister of trade unionist Ms. Delia Casal, in the alleged acts (illicit transfer of Faculty documents). The legal action brought by Ms. Delia Casal was still pending at the time the complainant sent its first communication.
.In its communications dated  October and  November , the complainant states that pursuant to a decision in August  of the Dean of the Faculty of Architecture, Ms. Elsa Casal was suspended and Ms. Delia Casal was relieved of her duties (the question of the application of sanctions being deferred until the end of the period of trade union immunity). The courts of first and second instance later ruled in favour of Ms. Delia Casal ordering her reinstatement, but the university authorities have refused to comply with the order. The courts of first and second instance ruled against trade unionist Ms. Alicia Rosa Di Grazia; she, therefore, lodged a special appeal with the Supreme Court without, however, being authorized to do so by the National Court of Appeal, which regards this as contrary to the provisions of ILO Conventions. The complainant encloses the relevant rulings.
.In its communication of  January , the Government forwards a communication dated  November  from the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Town Planning of the University of Buenos Aires, in which the Faculty states that the complainant, in order to evade an analysis of the three proceedings in which it is involved and in a final and desperate move to defend its position before the Committee, is attempting to put forward a list of supposed victims?of anti-union and ideological harassment. The complainant thus describes an imaginary authoritative regime, omitting the fact that it is referring to an institution of higher education whose authorities are voted in once every four years by the institutions three constituent bodies (students, graduates and teaching staff). It also neglects to mention that the UBAs highest authority is the University Assembly, which is open to all members; that the Rector is elected from among those members; and that this procedure has been strictly followed since the restoration of democracy in the country. It further refers to episodes in the universitys institutional life, all of which occurred in accordance with the UBAs statutory framework, adding value judgements and putting forward subjective and biased views on the subject.
.According to the Faculty of Architecture, the complainant distorts the purpose of the examination (auditora) and inquiry proceedings qualifying them as persecution whereas these are statutory mechanisms for supervising and investigating the functioning of administrative and academic activity. Herein lies the heart of the matter, as the complainant evades an analysis of the proceedings initiated to investigate complaints of irregularities implicating the appellants. Examination proceedings are an institutional obligation in the event of a presumed irregularity, designed to permit investigation of the facts, establish responsibilities and apply whatever sanctions may be required. Instead of trying at least to challenge the validity of the investigations on the basis of an analysis of the proceedings and the merits of the cases, the complainant claims that the investigations were conducted in an arbitrary manner, with the aim of persecuting those concerned. The proceedings, which were opened in an appropriate manner, were as follows:?In File No. ,, one of Mr. Pellolis subordinates accuses him of sexual harassment. There is so little suspicion of connivance on the part of the said subordinate with Mr. Pellolis harassers?that her name is not even mentioned in the complaint under examination. The fact is, however, that the young Ms. Jessica Marcus?accusation led to an investigation with unexpected consequences. Not only was the alleged act established, but it also came to light that, in his position as director of student management, Mr. Pelloli had behaved in a similar manner towards other female employees and that, through his bizarre and arbitrary behaviour, he instituted a reign of terror over his staff. A further fact that the written statement omits to mention is that up to that point Mr. Pelloli enjoyed excellent relations with and the full confidence of the Faculty authorities. He now accuses those same authorities of anti-union persecution, incidentally, after being proved guilty of sexual harassment; neither the proceedings nor the statement signed by him indicate any real attempt to defend himself except through the theory of conspiracy against him. The Faculty takes pride in having complied with the statutory obligation of investigating ?without prejudice or being subjected to any form of manipulation ?a complaint filed by a young administrative employee against a member of the universitys professional staff (with a bachelors degree in sociology) holding the post of director. In reply to the allegation, a copy of the full contents of File No. , was enclosed with the Governments reply. The previous investigation brought another irregularity to light: Mr. Pelloli was strongly suspected of having supplied his personal password for accessing the enrolment procedure to former employee Mr. Jorge Cuesta (who was also a regular student in the Faculty of Architecture), thus enabling the latter to enrol, against the regulations, in degree courses of study. The facts were established in this investigation (File No. ,) as well, and today Mr. Jorge Cuesta is no longer a student or an employee of the university; the statement fails to mention this, perhaps because Mr. Jorge Cuesta did not hold any trade union office and there was therefore no way that the persecution theory would stand up as far as he was concerned. In reply to the allegation, a copy of the full contents of File No. , was enclosed with the Governments reply.?As the abovementioned proceedings were under way, a complaint was made that documents had been removed from the student management department. This was investigated separately, and in this instance as well those responsible were identified and the facts proven. It was thus established that employee Ms. Mnica Blengini, and Mr. Jorge Cuesta (the employee-student given favourable treatment by Mr. Pelloli against university regulations), Ms. Delia Casal and Ms. Elsa Casal (both of them sisters-in-law of Mr. Pelloli) had participated, to varying degrees and as accessories, in the removal of three boxes of documents (including public instruments) belonging to the Facultys student management department and in their transfer to the premises of the Facultys non-teaching mutual association of which Mr. Pelloli was Chairperson. Apart from this",-1,1999,Argentina
262,"evident accumulation of power and nepotism there exists a strong presumption ?though no irrefutable evidence ?of his involvement as the instigator of the above acts. The complaint lodged by the complainant does not analyse the merits of the case and puts forward the persecution theory once again. The evidence of yet another extremely serious instance of misconduct was so overwhelming, however, that all the tactics aimed at confusing and obstructing the proceedings (the preferred strategy of the defence led by lawyer Ms. Norma Casal, Ms. Delia and Ms. Elsa Casals sister and wife of Mr. Pelloli) failed in this case as well. In reply to the allegation a copy of the full contents of File No. , was forwarded; this provides a detailed list of the documents removed from the student management department and found in the premises of the non-teaching staff mutual association.?In File No. ,/ pertaining to employee Ms. Alicia Rosa Di Grazia, the defence adopts the same diversionary tactic. Indeed, there is no mention of the object of the inquiry, but a description of the situation and an appraisal of the running of the kindergarten where Ms. Di Grazia was working; this has nothing to do with the investigation into the administrative employees wrongful management of funds. Although the facts were established once again, it should be pointed out that in Ms. Di Grazias case, the ruling was as mild as possible under the circumstances and the relevant regulations.
.In conclusion, the Faculty states that there can be no greater or more convincing evidence for shattering the image of the persecuted worker which these individuals are trying to build for themselves than the opinions, feelings and judgements expressed about Mr. Pelloli by his own subordinates. These views highlight the despotic manner in which he ran the student management department (of which he was the boss?supported by a system of loyalties founded on corruption and family ties) and the domination that he exercised through fear over all those who did not satisfy his often incomprehensible demands. A reading of the documents (especially File No. , pertaining to sexual harassment) shows Mr. Carlos Pelloli to be a harasser who, when the time comes to face a charge, shirks his responsibilities by claiming to be a victim of persecution, securing the assistance, as accessories, of his sisters-in-law and subordinates Ms. Delia and Ms. Elsa Casal.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant alleges on different dates and in an atmosphere of anti-union persecution the transfer of three trade unionists (Mr. Carlos Pelloli, Ms. Delia Casal and Ms. Alicia Rosa Di Grazia) and the suspension of one worker, Ms. Elsa Casal. The Government has forwarded the observations submitted by the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Buenos Aires in which the three trade unionists are declared guilty on the evidence of administrative proceedings, of serious misconduct, namely: sexual harassment (Mr. Carlos Pelloli); removal of three boxes of documents, including public instruments, from the Faculty premises (Ms. Delia Casal); and wrongful management of funds (Ms. Alicia Rosa Di Grazia). The administrative proceedings regarding the worker Ms. Elsa Casal, who was not a trade unionist, concluded that she was an accessory in the aforementioned removal of documents.
.The Committee notes that, in view of the fact that Mr. Carlos Pelloli and Ms. Delia Casal had been transferred without the formal requirements of judicial authorization stipulated by the legislation in the case of trade unionists being applied, the judicial authority ordered their reinstatement without considering the acts of which they were accused. However, given that both trade unionists were found guilty of serious misconduct, the Committee will not continue its examination of the allegations in question.
.Finally, the Committee takes note of the fact that the courts of first and second instance ruled against trade unionist Ms. Alicia Rosa Di Grazia.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",1,1999,Argentina
263,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Lockheed Aircraft Argentina S.A. Workers' Union (SITLA) dated  September . The Government sent its reply in a communication dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the Lockheed Aircraft Argentina S.A. Workers' Union (SITLA) explains that it is a ""merely registered"" trade union association which has  members, who on their membership forms authorize the trade union to deduct the corresponding amounts for their trade union dues. The complainant adds that on  September , the Ministry of Labour refused to issue the requested ruling to authorize these deductions to be made by the employer; this decision was confirmed in ruling No.  of  July , where it is argued that the deduction of trade union dues in accordance with section  of Act No.  is the exclusive right of trade union associations with trade union status and not of those that are merely registered.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government states that in this case the trade union body considers itself to have been prejudiced by the failure of the Ministry of Labour to direct the employer to deduct the trade union dues of the union's members. The applicable regulation, Act No. , stipulates that only trade union organizations with trade union status enjoy this right. That being so and as the applicant has merely been registered and does not have trade union status, its request was denied (a copy is sent of the action taken on this matter by the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations). The allegations can in no way be considered as undermining freedom of association or the international Conventions cited by the complainant. On this last point it should be recalled that the Republic of Argentina has not yet ratified Convention No. . There is no contradiction whatsoever with the views reiterated by the ILO supervisory bodies to the effect that ""the simple fact that a country's legislation establishes the distinction between the most representative trade union organizations and the other organizations should not in itself be a cause for criticism"" and that ""this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organizations that are not recognized as being amongst the most representative organizations of the essential means of defending the occupational interests of their members, of organizing their administration and activities and formulating their programmes of action, provided in Convention No. "". Thus trade union organizations with trade union status have the right and the authority to collect from their affiliates trade union dues to finance their activities. Furthermore, section  of Act No.  establishes an obligation for the employer to act as an agent for the deduction of dues for organizations with trade union status, which does not stop it doing the same if the affiliates of an organization that is merely registered so agree. The abovementioned Act in no way undermines the letter and spirit of Convention No. , as national legislation at all times guarantees workers the freedom to affiliate themselves to a given trade union organization or not, the fact that the employer can act as an agent for the deduction of dues being a simple administrative method of preventing evasion.
.The Government states that in Argentina the republican division of state powers is fully in force, in accordance with which it is the responsibility of the legislative power (National Congress) to issue legislation and of the judicial power (Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation and other lower courts) to monitor its constitutionality, all this without any interference from the executive power. Likewise, constitutional guarantees are protected by the new article  of the National Constitution (revised in ) which provides that ""any person may file a prompt and summary proceeding regarding constitutional guarantees (amparo), provided there is no other appropriate legal remedy, against any act or omission of the public authorities or individuals which currently or imminently may damage, limit, modify or threaten rights and guarantees recognized by this Constitution, treaties or laws, with open arbitrariness or illegality. In such case, the judge may declare that the act or omission is based on an unconstitutional rule"". As a result of this provision, any person or legal entity who considers that the rights inherent in freedom of association have been violated can use this constitutional legal action to remedy the prejudicial situation.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization is criticizing the fact that the Ministry of Labour, in two rulings, has refused to recognize its right to request the employer to deduct trade union dues from its members. The Government has stated that the applicable legislation obliges the employer to deduct trade union dues only for organizations with trade union status (most representative) and not for those which - as is the case of the complainant organization - are merely registered.
.In this respect the Committee observes that administrative ruling No.  of  July  includes the following points:... that it also stated that while its  affiliates authorize the deduction of the trade union dues, up until now they have found themselves obliged to make these deductions directly and personally for the abovementioned reasons.That, with respect to the briefly described grievances, it should be indicated that section  of the National Trade Union Associations Act, No. , expressly stipulates: ""employers shall be obliged to act as agents for the deduction of the amounts which, as membership dues or other contributions, the workers must pay trade union associations with trade union status"".That, in accordance with the abovementioned text, the power to deduct membership dues is granted exclusively for trade union associations with trade union status, which is why the alleged extensive interpretation with respect to associations that are merely registered lacks any basis in law ...
.On this matter, the Committee shares the opinion of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which is reproduced below:With regard to the provisions of the Act respecting the privileges accorded to trade unions with trade union status (representing various collective interests other than through collective bargaining (section ), entitlement to have trade union dues deducted from wages (section ), tax exemption (section ), and special protection granted to trade union leaders (sections  and )), the Committee emphasizes that this accumulation of privileges could have a negative impact on workers in their choice of trade union membership. In this respect, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that  per cent of workers belong to trade union organizations with trade union status whereas only  per cent belong to organizations which have merely been registered. The Committee considers that this disparity could be interpreted as workers wishing to belong to organizations which are able to develop a real trade union activity through the nature and number of privileges granted under sections ,  and  of the Act, as is the case of trade union organizations with trade union status, thereby prejudicing unions which are merely registered and only able to represent the individual interests of their members, at their request, as provided for under section  of the Act.The Committee again recalls that the distinction of the most representative union should not result in the trade union being granted privileges, as already stated, extending beyond that of priority in representation for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments, or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words, the Committee shares the view of the Committee on Freedom of Association that this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organizations that are not recognized as being amongst the most representative organizations of the essential means of defending the occupational interests of their members, of organizing their administration and activities and formulating their programmes of action, provided for under Articles  and  of the Convention.The Committee also recalls that when legislation confers on the most representative trade unions certain privileges in connection with the defence of their occupational interests, by virtue of which they alone are in a position to act effectively, the granting of such privileges should not be made subject to such conditions as to influence unduly the choice of workers regarding the organization to which they intend to belong (see the report of the Committee of Experts, Report III (Part A), , page ).
.This being the case, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that with respect to the deduction of trade union dues from wages, legislation does not discriminate against trade union organizations that are merely registered as opposed to those with trade union status.

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of August , the Trade Union of Newspaper and Magazine Vendors of the Federal Capital and Greater Buenos Aires (SIVENDIA) states that pursuant to resolution No. / issued by the Ministry of the Economy and Works and Public Services of the nation, the activity of newspaper and magazine vendors is now considered a commercial activity, contrary to the legislative tradition and the de facto elements whereby the State had recognized this activity as a form of labour. Thus this resolution is a flagrant infringement of the labour rights of the vendors of newspapers, magazines and similar publications, the right to unionization and to free and voluntary negotiation of the conditions of employment in the sector. The complainant adds that the sale of newspapers and magazines is regulated by Legislative Decree No. /, ratified by Act No.  and the supplementary resolutions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security of the nation and that it is clear from such standards that the activity is a form of work and not a commercial activity.
.The complainant points out that the undeniably labour nature of the activity was recognized by the State itself when it granted SIVENDIA legal personality No.  in , in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth in the Act respecting trade union associations, for the purposes of defending and representing vendors in the newspaper and magazine sector.
.The complainant points out that transforming the labour activity of its members into a commercial activity will result in the disappearance of the activity.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the complainant lodged an appeal for protection against resolution No. /. In this respect, the courts of the first and second instance ruled that the standard in question was unconstitutional and null and void since the conditions of ""necessity and urgency"" required for the issuing of the measure did not exist. In these circumstances, resolution No. / has no practical application of any kind, and the matter is therefore purely theoretical. In the light of the above, the Government emphasizes that there has been no violation of international Conventions since the standard which would supposedly result in such a situation was declared unconstitutional, and Legislative Decree No. /, ratified by Act No. , was declared to be fully in force.
.The Committee observes that the complainant in this case challenges resolution No. / of April , issued by the Ministry of the Economy and Works and Public Services of the previous Government. According to the complainant, this resolution disregards the labour nature of the sale of newspapers and magazines and the transformation of such activity into a commercial activity, thus affecting the right to unionization and collective bargaining of workers in the sector.
.In this respect, the Committee takes note that the Government states that the complainant lodged an appeal for protection against resolution No. / and that in the courts of the first and second instance the judicial authorities considered the resolution to be unconstitutional and null and void, and that it therefore has no practical application. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that the case requires no further examination.

.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July , the Federation of Trade Unions of Municipal Workers of Santa Fe Province (FESTRAM) alleges that, from January  onwards, local and municipal leaders in Santa Fe Province refused to appoint representatives for the purpose of forming the joint negotiating committee instituted under the terms of Provincial Law  of  (according to the complainant, this committee, consisting of eight representatives of municipal and local authorities for the employers' side and eight representatives of FESTRAM for the employees' side, issues resolutions and formalizes agreements and accords on various matters), and that the provincial authorities have not met their legal obligation to convene an annual meeting to allow local officials and leaders to appoint representatives. Thus, according to the complainant, this collective bargaining body for municipal and local government employees has been paralysed.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that the Santa Fe provincial authorities convened a meeting for  November  of all the local and municipal leaders involved for the purpose of electing the joint committee to which Law No.  refers. The Government supplies a copy of the relevant documents relating to the convocation and arrangements for the meeting.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant alleges that since  no meeting was convened for the purpose of appointing representatives of local and municipal authorities in Santa Fe Province to sit on the joint negotiating committee required under provincial law.

267,".The complaint was submitted in a communication from the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Association of State Workers (ATE) dated June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated June , the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) and the Association of State Workers (ATE) state that as from  the Government of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antrtida e Islas del Atlntico Sur began a series of attempts to restrict freedom of association. The complainant organizations explain that Provincial Act No.  respecting the reorganization of the structure of the provincial government was issued in , followed by Provincial Decree No. / and Decree No. /, the latter repealing the former and being the source of the complainant organizations' criticism.
.The complainant organizations state that Provincial Decree No. / relates to freedom of association and that the ATE has lodged an action of unconstitutionality before the judicial authorities on which no decision has yet been handed down. They indicate that the decree in question contains provisions to regulate the holding of assemblies in workplaces and during working hours. They explain that article  of Annex I to the decree establishes that the right to hold meetings or assemblies established in Act No.  respecting trade union associations can only be exercised at the end of the working day and in a location assigned by the employer. Only in exceptional circumstances may the corresponding authorization be requested for meetings to be held during working hours, in which case - if the grounds are acceptable - the administrative instrument to authorize the meeting will be issued. The complainants consider that the rule prevents the exercise of the right of assembly during working hours and affects communication between the trade union and the workers. They are also of the view that the criticized provision implies undue interference in the life of the trade union association, given the requirement for permission to be requested in order to hold meetings during working hours.
.The complainant organizations go on to refer to a conflict that ended in an open-ended strike being called in conjunction with the submission of a complaint relating to maintenance and service workers employed by the public administration of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antrtida e Islas del Atlntico Sur. The complainants explain that the main duties of these workers, as established by way of collective agreement, are to fully clean school premises, carry out specific tasks involved in the preparation of daily meals, supervise and oversee the work of kitchen hands, serve meals in school dining-rooms, serve breakfast and/or tea to pupils, supervise and oversee hygiene measures in kitchens and dining-rooms and general kitchen work, order the necessary ingredients for the weekly menu, assist in the preparation of ingredients for meals, do the washing up, ensure kitchens and dining areas are kept scrupulously clean, etc. Most of the staff in question work in schools governed by the public administration in the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antrtida e Islas del Atlntico Sur.
.The complainant organizations state that as from  the provincial government made a number of attempts to privatize the abovementioned sector. In addition, there are also people working in the sector not covered by the standard labour agreements (under so-called work or labour schemes) who perform the same tasks as maintenance and service workers; this form of contracting workers has come under heavy criticism. The complainants add that in November  the ATE announced its decision to go on strike, calling for a wage increase for the entire central administration and for the repeal of all rules that adversely affect the development of freedom of association; the compulsory conciliation procedure was then initiated. Following a number of negotiations, on  May  it was finally decided that a full-time strike and industrial action would begin until further notice for all shifts as from  May . According to the complainant organizations, immediately the measure was taken the authorities announced that they would contract cooperatives to replace the strikers and on  May the strikers were told to return to work or the appropriate sanctions would be applied. On  May members of the police force of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antrtida e Islas del Atlntico Sur went to a school in Ushuaia to detain the staff involved in the strike action and demanded that the authorities establish a list of staff involved in the strike. As cooperatives had been contracted to perform the work of the strikers, they tried to stop the cooperative members doing the work, explaining the reasons for this measure of trade union action. The complainants state that judicial proceedings were initiated on the grounds that it was a criminal offence for staff from the ATE to prevent the access of staff from the Work Cooperative of Tierra del Fuego and that by the time the complaint was submitted  named strikers had been investigated in connection with the incident. The legal situation of those charged has not yet been resolved. Similarly, the complainant organizations allege that the provincial government used trade union action as a reason to replace the strikers by workers contracted under the abovementioned work schemes.
.In its communication dated  May  the Government states with regard to Provincial Decree No. /, criticized by the complainant organizations, that the requirement for acceptable grounds and prior authorization to hold assemblies at the workplace and during working hours can in no way be considered as violating freedom of association. This is because no limitations are placed on the holding of assemblies or meetings, and neither are any restrictions imposed, if the assemblies and meetings are held outside working hours. Furthermore, there is no prohibition on the possibility of holding assemblies or meetings in the workplace or during working hours. The fact is that this activity is regulated in view of the unquestionable principle that the worker is at the employer's disposal during working hours, something that is particularly relevant when it comes to activities relating to the public in general, which would be seriously affected if, without any notification whatsoever, it were permitted for assemblies or meetings to be held at the workplace and during working hours.
.As regards the conflict concerning maintenance and service staff, the Government states that on no occasion was the right to strike limited, nor was the concept of essential services invoked to establish minimum services, nor was the measure declared illegal, nor was any sanction adopted against those involved in the open-ended strike. The Government adds that, as explained by the complainants, the main duties of the staff participating in the open-ended strike include fully cleaning school premises, serving food in school dining-rooms, overseeing hygiene in kitchens, preparing daily glasses of milk for pupils, serving children their breakfast and tea, etc., all of this in public schools coming under the provincial administration. In this respect the Government mentions that in accordance with the criteria established both by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Committee of Experts, essential services are services which could endanger the life, personal safety or health of the population. On this point the Government notes that unfortunately in a number of provinces in Argentina school canteens are the principal source of nourishment for underprivileged children of school age. As a result the failure to provide cleaning services in schools (classrooms, toilets, kitchens, etc.), particularly for an indeterminate length of time, constitutes a source of infection that could endanger the health of the children and other members of the educational community. This being the case, the lack of cleaning and the closure of canteens in schools endanger the health and safety of an enormous number of children. Despite this fact, it has never been invoked as a restriction on the right to strike. Owing to the circumstances mentioned, and given the extension of the action, the most imperative duties of the striking staff were carried out by staff from labour cooperatives or participants in public employment schemes. Needless to say, the reason for this was the need to re-establish - as a form of stopgap - a service of such vital importance to the community (above all for lower-income sectors) as the abovementioned canteens and to maintain the level of hygiene of toilets, kitchens and other areas in public schools where hundreds of children congregate daily, which constitutes a basic principle of public health. It is simply a matter of balancing the right to strike with the most basic needs of the community. Given the circumstances, it is impossible to consider the situation described as one where outside manpower is being used to break an open-ended strike.
.The Government declares that as regards the charges brought against certain individuals for preventing others from entering schools and the application",0,2000,Argentina
268,"of article  of the Penal Code cited by the complainant organizations, the argument put forward in the complaint is somewhat flimsy as a worker from a workers' cooperative is manifestly a worker; whether or not there is an employment relationship, the person is a worker. For the reasons given it is considered that in the case in question the principles of freedom of association were not infringed; on the contrary, attempts were made to align the legitimate exercise of the right to strike (without either restricting or limiting it) with the most basic needs of the community as regards the protection of life, health and personal safety.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations: () raise objections to Provincial Decree No. / of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antrtida e Islas del Atlntico Sur, in view of the fact that it does not permit - except in exceptional cases and subject to authorization - the exercise of the right to hold meetings or assemblies by trade union organizations in the provincial public administration during working hours; and () allege that in the framework of a strike called by maintenance and service workers employed by the public administration in the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antrtida e Islas del Atlntico Sur, the authorities employed workers from cooperatives or participating in work schemes to replace the strikers, and that some strikers were accused of having committed an offence stipulated in the Penal Code relating to the exercise of violence against third parties to oblige them to participate in a strike.
.As regards Provincial Decree No. / objected to by the complainant organizations, the Committee notes the Government's declaration that the decree does not restrict the right to hold assemblies or meetings if they are held outside working hours, and that it cannot be considered as a violation of freedom of association to require prior authorization to hold assemblies at the workplace and during working hours. The Government considers that the decree does not prohibit assemblies or meetings at the workplace and during working hours, but instead regulates such meetings given that the activities concerned relate to the public which would be seriously affected if it were permitted, with no requirements whatsoever, to hold such assemblies and meetings in the workplace and during working hours.
.In this regard the Committee recalls that the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ) - ratified by Argentina - provides in Article  that ""Such facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognised public employees' organisations as may be appropriate in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work""; and that ""The granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned"". This being the case, the Committee considers that the Provincial Decree objected to by the complainant organizations does not violate the provisions contained in Convention No.  nor the principles of freedom of association relating to the right of workers' organizations to hold trade union meetings.
.As regards the allegation concerning the employment of workers from cooperatives or participating in work schemes to replace maintenance and service workers employed by the public administration of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antrtida e Islas del Atlntico Sur who had called an open-ended strike, the Committee notes the Government's declaration that: (i) at no time was the right to strike restricted, nor the measure declared illegal, nor were sanctions adopted against the strikers, nor was the concept of essential services invoked to establish a minimum service; (ii) the main duties of the staff who went on strike are the cleaning of schools (classrooms, toilets and kitchens) and the serving of food in school canteens (the pupils' breakfast and tea); (iii) in various provinces of Argentina school canteens are the principal source of nourishment for underprivileged children of school age; (iv) the lack of cleaning and the closure of school canteens endangers the health and safety of an enormous number of children; and (v) given the extension of the strike, the most important aspects of the staff's duties were carried out by staff from work cooperatives or by participants in public employment schemes.
.In this respect the Committee considers that the activities performed by maintenance and service workers employed by the public administration of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antrtida e Islas del Atlntico Sur, which have been described in similar terms by the complainant organizations and the Government, fall within the definition of essential services. In effect, the provision of food to pupils of school age - particularly in areas located away from the main urban centres - and the cleaning of schools are services which if interrupted could endanger the life, personal safety or health of pupils. As a result, the use of a group of people to carry out the functions of workers on strike in the sector in question, which is considered to be an essential service, does not violate the principles of freedom of association. In this respect, the Committee has only objected in the past to the hiring of workers to break a strike in sectors which are not essential [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.With regard to the allegation that some strikers (listed by name by the complainant organizations) from among the maintenance and service workers employed by the public administration of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antrtida e Islas del Atlntico Sur had been charged for having committed an offence stipulated in the Penal Code of Argentina relating to the exercise of violence against third parties to oblige them to participate in a strike, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent any specific observations in this regard. This being the case, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about developments in the legal proceedings, as well as about the situation of the workers charged (whether they have been tried or their cases dismissed, etc.). The Committee also requests the Government to send it a copy of any decisions handed down in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about developments in the criminal proceedings brought for acts of violence against third parties to oblige them to participate in a strike, as well as about the situation of the workers charged (whether they have been tried or their cases dismissed, etc.). The Committee also requests the Government to send it a copy of any decisions handed down in this respect.",3,2000,Argentina
269,".The complaint is contained in a communication sent in June  by the Union of Judicial Employees of Misiones Province (UJPM). This organization sent additional information in August . The Government replied in a communication dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of June and August , the Union of Judicial Employees of Misiones Province (UJPM) explains that, when the provincial government illegally introduced the ""emergency solidarity tax"" followed by a ""special temporary emergency tax"", workers went on strike and took other trade union action. The complainant alleges that on  October  it announced that it would be carrying out direct action involving the withdrawal of workers from the workplace for the last two hours of the day. The UJPM alleges that it always maintained a minimum service, but the Misiones High Court nevertheless ordered that workers who had participated in the strike should lose one day's pay for the two-hour stoppage. The UJPM adds that the union leader Mr. Julio Argentino de los Santos was docked one day's pay and also fined  per cent of his salary as a disciplinary measure.
.In its communication of  January  the Government indicates that the UJPM sent a note to the Freedom of Association Committee (a copy is supplied) in which it states that ""relations between the organization which we represent and the government of Misiones province, including the judicial authorities, have been virtually normalized and a number of specific measures have already been adopted including the return of sums of money previously deducted, and that there is a willingness at the highest levels to examine the issues raised by the UJPM"", and asks the Committee to keep this in mind when it examines the case.
.The Government adds that the judicial authorities of the province supplied documents which indicate that at no time was the UJPM restricted or limited in the exercise of its constitutional right to strike, nor were disciplinary measures taken against the union or the strikers. It is incorrect to regard the loss of one day's wages as a disciplinary measure, as this was in fact the logical consequence of the principle of ""a day's pay for a day's work"" and of the constitutional principle of equality with regard to workers who did carry out their duties.
.There is a distinction to be drawn between the measures described in the previous paragraph and disciplinary sanctions in the true meaning of the term (which were not applied in the present case). The latter would include measures such as summary proceedings against strikers, suspension, dismissal, union deregistration proceedings, etc.
.As regards the alleged sanction imposed on Mr. Julio Argentino de los Santos involving a fine of  per cent of his salary, the Government indicates that the public prosecutor's office in Misiones province accepted Mr. de los Santos' petition and recognized the rights he claimed. The matter was thus resolved and the fine was not imposed.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant alleges that, following a two-hour strike in the judicial sector, employees who took part were docked five-and-a-half hours' pay (i.e. an amount equivalent to a day's pay), and the union leader Mr. Julio Argentino de los Santos was in addition fined  per cent of his salary. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the state prosecutor's office accepted Mr. de los Santos' submission, recognized the rights which he had invoked and quashed the fine. The Committee also notes that the Government emphasizes that the right to strike is a constitutional right, that disciplinary sanctions were not imposed against the strikers and that docking a day's pay is not a disciplinary sanction but a means of applying the principle of ""a day's pay for a day's work"".
.The Committee notes the complainant's allegation, which has not been denied by the Government, that workers lost five and a half hours' pay although the stoppage lasted for only two hours. In any event, the Committee notes that ""relations between the parties have been virtually normalized, that a number of specific measures have already been adopted including the return of sums of money previously deducted, and that there is a willingness at the highest levels to examine the issues raised by the UJPM"". The Committee considers that there is no need to pursue its examination of these allegations.

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, considering allegations relating to dismissals or transfers of trade union leaders and the revocation of the trade union registration of a federation, the Committee made the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):- The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the final decision concerning the dismissal of the trade union leader, Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn (reinstated for the time being under a protective measure).- The Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the dismissal or transfer between  and  of the following trade union leaders from the province of Salta (some of whom were from the municipality of General Gemes), whose proceedings have not yet been concluded: Carlos Alberto Ibarra, Hugo Miguel Quispe, Rubn Antonio Saravia, Juana Isnardez de Ruiz, Reynaldo Eduardo Pistan, Ramona Escobar de Gutirrez, Juan Carlos Valdez, Miguel Angel Vittor, Ricardo Armiana Dohorman and Hctor Luis Cruz.- The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the administrative authority withdraws its appeal against the decision of the first instance judicial authority which ordered the trade union registration of the FETERA trade union, and to keep it informed of any decision or ruling adopted with respect to this case.
.In its communication dated  August  the Government states, with respect to the Committee's recommendations concerning the request to ensure that the administrative authority would withdraw the appeal against the decision of the judicial authority which ordered the trade union registration of the FETERA trade union, that the appeal lodged before the Supreme Court of Justice against the first instance ruling handed down in this case by the National Labour Appeal Court was rejected as being inadmissible, and the appealed decision was consequently upheld.
.As regards the recommendation in which the Committee asks to be informed of the final decision concerning the dismissal of the trade union leader Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn, the Government states that the case file was temporarily withdrawn from the court by Mr. Martn's legal representative, with the protective measure previously ordered remaining in force and with the judicial proceedings being paralysed as a result. The Government indicates that until the legal proceedings are returned by the complainant's legal representative, and the action prosecuted by the parties, it is procedurally impossible to hand down a ruling.
.As regards the Committee's recommendation concerning the dismissal or transfer of workers of the provincial and municipal public administration of Salta, the Government states the following:- Vittor, Miguel Angel: this person was working in the Provincial Institute for Urban Development and Housing; he subsequently resigned from his position with that body, with effect on  August , through Decision No. / of the IPDUV. On the payroll of the Banco Macro SA.- Cruz, Hctor Luis: joined the management of the Highway Administration of Salta on  June , working there as a panel beater until  March , when he joined the Programme for the Reorganization of Provincial and Municipal Public Employment, by Decree No. /; this programme was established by Provincial Act No.  in the framework of the Reform of the Provincial State. For the year he remained in the programme the official received the corresponding monthly remuneration, as well as the compensation stipulated in article  of the above Act. Mr. Cruz initiated legal action against the province before the Administrative Court of First Instance with the legal proceedings ""Cruz, Hector Luis v. the management of the Highway Administration of Salta and/or the province of Salta under summary proceedings of trade union protection"", Case No. /. The judgement handed down in this court was appealed against before the Court of Justice of the province of Salta, with no decision having yet been handed down.
.As regards its request for the final decision concerning the dismissal of the trade union leader Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn (who had been reinstated in his job provisionally under a protective measure), the Committee notes the Government's statement that the judicial process is paralysed - with the protective measure remaining in force - given that the case file was temporarily withdrawn from the court by Mr. Martn's legal representative and that until it is returned and the action prosecuted by the parties it is procedurally impossible to hand down a ruling. In these circumstances, the Committee notes that the judicial process has been temporarily paralysed but that it may be reactivated. If the process is reactivated, the Committee once again asks the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings.
.With respect to the dismissal or transfer of a number of trade union leaders from the province of Salta between  and , the Committee notes that the Government states the following: () Mr. Miguel Angel Vittor: resigned from his position with the Provincial Institute for Urban Development and Housing and is currently working for Banco Macro SA; and () Mr. Hctor Luis Cruz: was working for the management of the Highway Administration of Salta and on  March  joined the Programme for the Reorganization of Provincial and Municipal Public Employment, having received for the year that he was in that programme the corresponding monthly remuneration and the compensation stipulated. Mr. Cruz lodged a judicial appeal for trade union protection and the judgement of first instance was appealed against before the Court of Justice of the province of Salta. To date no further judgement has been handed down. The Committee asks the Government to send it a copy of the judgement of first instance concerning the dismissal of the trade union leader Mr. Hctor Luis Cruz and to inform it of the final judgement handed down. Lastly, while it regrets that the Government has not sent its observations concerning the situation of the proceedings relating to the other trade union leaders (Carlos Alberto Ibarra, Hugo Miguel Quispe, Rubn Antonio Saravia, Juana Isnardez de Ruiz, Reynaldo Eduardo Pistan, Ramona Escobar de Gutirrez, Juan Carlos Valdez and Ricardo Armiana Dormn), the Committee asks it to keep it informed of the outcome.
.Concerning the appeal lodged against the decision of the judicial authority which ordered the trade union registration of the Federation of Energy Workers of the Argentine Republic (FETERA), the Committee notes that the Supreme Court of Justice has rejected the appeal in question and that FETERA has been registered.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee once again requests the Government if the case is reactivated to keep it informed of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings relating to the dismissal of the trade union leader Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn (reinstated in his job provisionally under a protective measure).(b) The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgement of first instance concerning the dismissal of the trade union leader Mr. Hctor Luis Cruz from the province of Salta and to inform it of the final judgement handed down.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the proceedings relating to the dismissal or transfer of the following trade union leaders: Carlos Alberto Ibarra, Hugo Miguel Quispe, Rubn Antonio Saravia, Juana Isnardez de Ruiz, Reynaldo Eduardo Pistan, Ramona Escobar de Gutirrez, Juan Carlos Valdez and Ricardo Armiana Dormn.
.The complaint was submitted in a communication from the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) dated  February .The complainant organization presented supplementary information and new allegations in communications dated  February,  June and  December .

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) alleges that the privatization of the Atlantic Electrical Energy Distribution Enterprise (EDEA S.A.), consistently opposed by the Mar del Plata Lighting and Power Workers' Union (which called for observance of the collective agreement in force), had resulted in the dismissal of over , workers. According to the complainant, the trade union had undertaken various types of industrial action, including strikes, and the enterprise illicitly brought pressure to bear by dismissing and suspending trade union representatives and members as well as non-members, and through the persecution and prosecution in civil and labour courts (legal action taken with a view to dismissal) of the trade union leaders Messrs. Jos Jorge Rigane (General-Secretary), Oscar Alberto Escalante and Nstor",-1,1998,Argentina
271,"Daniel Cuenca, who were wrongfully accused of committing criminal offences. The enterprise instigated criminal and civil actions against them, falsely accusing them of responsibility for bomb scares, sabotage at enterprise facilities and disturbances, etc., and set the press and media against them. The enterprise also dismissed staff delegates without taking the step of calling upon the courts to lift their trade union protection, as required by the legislation.
.The CTA adds that Alitalia S.A. refused to grant trade union privileges to the trade union leader, Mr. Hugo Perosa, and completely changed his assignment, resulting in a deprivation of work responsibilities. Afterward, when Mr. Perosa became a member of the CTA executive, the enterprise dismissed him (on  October ), claiming ""neglect of duties"" as the cause, and without calling upon the courts to lift his trade union protection, as required by the legislation. (In a communication of  December  sent to the Office, the CTA states that Federal Labour Chamber  had handed down a ruling on  November  ordering the enterprise to reinstate Mr. Hugo Perosa in his post.)
.The CTA further alleges that the Nestl S.A. enterprise dismissed the trade union leader Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn without requesting that his trade union protection be lifted.
.In its communication of  February  the CTA alleges that the provincial government of Salta and certain municipalities of the province refused to apply Act No.  on trade unions, and specifically its provisions protecting the job security of trade union leaders who are public servants. This applied in particular to those who opposed privatization, as was the case of leaders of the State Workers' Association (ATE). The CTA refers to  leaders who were dismissed or transferred without the required judicial procedure being initiated to lift their trade union protection, and who were the subject of proceedings between  and  which have still not been concluded, including the following leaders from the province of Salta and some of whom were from the municipality of General Gemes: Carlos Alberto Ibarra, Miguel Angel Ravaza, Hugo Miguel Quispe, Rubn Antonio Saravia, Juana Isnardez de Ruiz, Reynaldo Eduardo Pistan, Ramona Escobar de Gutirrez, Juan Carlos Valdez, Cristina Crdoba Ruiz de Mosa, Miguel Angel Vittor, Laura Alicia Lpez, Samuel Osvaldo Polo, Elio Fernndez Rodrguez, Ricardo Armiana Dohorman, Ral Avellaneda, Ren Francisco Elejalde, Hctor Luis Cruz and Luis Roberto Ramos.
.In its communication of  June , the CTA alleges that on  May  the registration of the Federation of Energy Workers of the Argentine Republic (FETERA) was revoked through administrative channels in violation of the legislation and of Convention No. . The revocation was based on the Federation's failure to comply with the requirements for constituent organizations, which are not set out by the legislation. It further alleges the persecution by the authorities of the province of Santiago del Estero of the State Workers' Association (ATE), as criminal charges were reportedly brought against its trade union leaders and its members' contributions were unjustly retained.
.In more general terms, the CTA notes that there is discrimination against trade union organizations which are ""merely registered"" (simplemente inscriptas) as opposed to those which are registered with ""official trade union status"" (personera gremial) with regard to protection against abuse and persecution by employers and the authorities. Specifically, sections  and  of Act No.  on trade unions reserve for representatives of trade union associations with ""official trade union status"" the legal and procedural guarantees of protection against dismissal or modification of their work situation. Similarly, from the complaint it can be understood that there is some doubt regarding judicial rulings on the applicability of these provisions to public servants and employees.
.In its communications of ,  and  October ,  May and  October  and  January , the Government states that with regard to the complaint made against the Atlantic Energy Distribution Enterprise S.A. (EDEA S.A.) for allegedly committing anti-trade union acts, the Mar del Plata Lighting and Power Workers' Union correctly requested the intervention of the local administrative authorities. Consequently, the Ministry of Labour intervened by issuing Decision No. /, which ordered that two trade union leaders be reinstated immediately and left the suspension of another without effect. The Ministry refrained from any further intervention pending a definitive ruling by the competent judicial authority. The Ministry's decision was appealed by EDEA S.A., thus prompting the Ministry of Labour to issue Decision No. /. In it, following an extensive examination of the de jure and de facto circumstances surrounding the previous decision, the Ministry rejected the appeal against Decision No. / and confirmed it in its entirety. An agreement was signed on  October  between EDEA S.A. and the Argentine Federation of Lighting and Power Workers (FATLYF), and was ratified by the administrative labour authority. In it: both parties expressed their interest in resolving and overcoming the conflicts which gave rise to sanctions, suspensions and other measures adopted by the enterprise; EDEA S.A. undertook to make null and void the disciplinary suspensions applied to its staff who took part in the work stoppages on ,  and  July , to pay the appropriate compensation to the dismissed staff, to transfer some of the staff and to reinstate the rest in the enterprise; EDEA S.A. further undertook to abstain from pursuing all pending judicial proceedings against the Mar del Plata Lighting and Power Workers' Union and against the members of its executive, including Mr. Rigane; and EDEA S.A. undertook to drop the criminal charges it had brought following the incidents on  July . Clearly, it appears that the effective conciliation efforts of the competent authorities in the government of the province of Buenos Aires made it possible to overcome this conflict and to reaffirm the protection and guarantee of freedom of association.
.As regards the allegations concerning the incidents in the province of Salta, the Government states that the situations of Mr. Luis Alberto Ramos, Mr. Vctor Angel Ravaza and Ms. Cristina Crdoba Ruiz have been resolved. Mr. Osvaldo Polo, Mr. Ral Vicente Avellaneda, Ms. Laura Alicia Lpez de Cabral, Mr. Ren Francisco Elejalde and Mr. Elio Fernndez Rodrguez, who were employed by what was then known as the Bank of the Province of Salta, have come to an agreement with the bank and have halted any action taken against it. As regards the other individual cases, since they were not within the direct competence of the provincial executive, it was not possible to provide any information beyond that which had been submitted. The national Ministry of Labour had directly requested the appropriate bodies and institutions (the municipality of General Gemes, the Senate of the province of Salta and the Bank of the Province of Salta, S.A.) to report on the situation to which the complainant referred.
.As regards the dismissal of the Alitalia S.A. trade union leader, Mr. Hugo Perosa, the Government states that no request for intervention has been submitted to the authorities, and that no judicial case has been brought. Nonetheless, from the inquiries which have been carried out there is no indication that the conflict was continuing. Under the legislation, questions relating to trade union immunity do not fall within the competence of the executive branch, and must be resolved through the labour courts.
.As regards the dismissal by the Nestl S.A. enterprise of the trade union leader Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn, the Government states that the CTA and the trade union leader in question have undertaken a summary reinstatement procedure against the enterprise, as provided in section  of Act No. , and that it is currently before the National First Instance Judge, ""Third Nomination"" (Tercera Nominacion) (Civil and Commercial) of the City of Villa Mara in the province of Crdoba. In principle, the protective measure requested by the complainant reinstating Mr. Martn has already been taken. The Government includes copies of the lawsuit and the judicial decision. The judicial file on the incidents has been in the possession of the trade union leader's lawyer since June , and has thus far not been returned to the judge. Despite the lack of action taken by the interested party, the judge has been asked to request that the file be returned so as to clarify the stage of the proceedings and determine whether any damages occurred which would justify intervention by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security pursuant to the protection provided under Conventions Nos.  and .
.As regards the allegations concerning the Federation of Energy Workers of the Argentine Republic (FETERA), the case is before the courts, as the Federation has invoked the provisions of section  of Act No.  on trade unions, which establishes the exclusive competence of the National Labour Appeals Chamber for such questions, a legislative policy that is, moreover, in conformity with the principles of freedom of association. The Chamber recently ruled that judicial Decision No. / was to be revoked, and ordered that the FETERA must be registered in the Registry of Trade Union Associations (the",2,1998,Argentina
272,"Government encloses a copy of the ruling). Along the same lines, it should be noted once again that in the Argentine Republic the administrative acts are subject to the full review and supervision of an independent judicial authority. For that reason, as an appeal has been lodged against the judicial decision in question under the special appeals procedure provided by Act No. , and with the case pending before the Supreme Court of Justice, the Committee on Freedom of Association is requested for the time being to take into consideration that the matter has not yet been dealt with definitively.
.As regards the protection afforded by the legal system against anti-union discrimination, the Government states that the Constitution expressly establishes in the second paragraph of article bis that ""Trade union representatives shall have the guarantees required for them to accomplish their trade union activities and those required for their job security"", and the legislative provisions are in conformity with this principle. The main provision on trade union immunity is found in section  of Act No. , which provides that -Any workers or trade union associations hindered or blocked from the regular exercise of their rights of freedom of association guaranteed under this Act shall be able to assert the protection of such rights before the competent judicial tribunal, in conformity with the summary procedure established under Section  of the national Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure or the equivalent provincial codes of civil procedure, so that the tribunal is able, when appropriate, immediately to bring the anti-trade union behaviour to an end.This standard introduces a dynamic and effective means in order to guarantee the ""rights of freedom of association"". The active subjects of the action are ""any workers or trade union associations"". This section and the protection it affords are not restricted to members, delegates or members of representative bodies, etc., but extends to any worker or group of workers who may carry out such activities in search of effective remedies. By the same token, because it does not distinguish between trade unions, the action may be taken by a union whether or not it has ""official trade union status"", by first, second or third level trade unions or even by a group of trade unions. The object of the action is to protect the regular exercise of the rights of freedom of association. In this sense, the case law has shown that the criteria for the interpretation of the rights of freedom of association must be broad, although the provisions of Act No.  do not stand on their own, deriving as they do from section bis of the Constitution. Act No.  sets out measures for those who arbitrarily hinder the full exercise of such rights and obstruct the fundamental guarantees recognized in the national Constitution. Section  of the Act provides that -Whoever arbitrarily hinders, obstructs, restricts or in any way impinges upon the full and equitable exercise on an equal basis of the fundamental rights and guarantees recognized in the national Constitution shall be obliged, at the request of the injured party, to make the discriminatory act null and void or to cease its implementation, and to compensate the moral and material damages caused. For the purposes of this Section, discriminatory acts or omissions based on race, religion, nationality, ideology, political or trade union opinion, sex, economic status, social condition or physical characteristics shall be of special concern.The set of constitutional provisions, the provisions of section  mentioned above and Act No.  provide appropriate protection for all workers to exercise their trade union activities, as they prevent inter alia dismissal, suspension or arbitrary modification of conditions of work in such circumstances.
.In addition, sections  and  of the Act on trade unions more specifically address the protection of trade union representatives in an enterprise, though they are not the only provisions which do so, as can be seen in the previous paragraphs. For representatives to carry out such activities, under section  of the Act and in accordance with other conditions, they must be members of associations with ""official trade union status"", although that requirement may not be necessary ""when the employer with whom the representative has to work has no association registered with official trade union status, the function of representative may be carried out by members of an association which is merely registered"".
.It is thus clear that Argentine law affords protection not only to representatives of organizations with official trade union status, but to all trade union representatives in the enterprise, and further to all workers whether or not they are members of a trade union organization, be it with official trade union status or merely registered. It is up to those who have theoretically suffered damages to appeal to the courts to assert their rights when they have been violated, as the State is prohibited under section (c) of Act No.  from intervening in any way.
.Finally, as regards the allegations of persecution against members of the State Workers' Association (ATE) by the authorities of the province of Santiago del Estero, the Government requests more time to present its observations, as the province is in the process of evaluating and considering the case and the reply still has yet to be received. As regards the allegations concerning the Province of Santiago del Estero, the Government denies that the provincial government instigated criminal proceedings against Ms. Alba Luna Aguirre de Castillo. Criminal proceedings were initiated against the trade union leader on  July  by members of the board of the ATE's Santiago del Estero branch, with other trade union leaders accused under the provisions of section , paragraph , of the Criminal Code of defrauding that branch. The case is currently before the Third Chamber (Crime), and the trial has been scheduled to begin on  January , subject to the state of health of the accused, Ms. Aguirre de Castillo, who is currently ill in Buenos Aires. The Chamber has ordered forensic experts from the Buenos Aires city courts to determine her exact state of health so as to establish whether it can allow her to stand trial, as the proceedings have previously been suspended for health reasons. As regards the retention of trade union dues, the Government states that the allegation is unfounded, as the province was sued in the Supreme Court of Justice for collecting contributions, and it was proved during that case that the payments had been forwarded. It should be noted in any case that the payments were made with some delay owing to the serious economic and financial crisis which the provincial government had to face, which even led to federal intervention under Act No. ..
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organization alleges the dismissal, transfer or prosecution of trade union leaders and shortcomings in the legal protection against anti-union discrimination, as the latter provides preferential treatment for organizations with ""official trade union status"" (personera gremial) over those which are ""merely registered"", which has resulted in excessive delays in the treatment of cases by the judicial authorities and has led to the revocation from the trade union registry of the Federation of Energy Workers of the Argentine Republic (FETERA).
.As regards the allegations of anti-union dismissals, the Committee notes with interest that some of the cases have been resolved. In this regard, the Committee notes that: () according to the Government, thanks to the conciliation efforts of the authorities, the Atlantic Electrical Energy Distribution Enterprise (EDEA S.A.) enterprise and the Argentine Federation of Lighting and Power Workers (FATLYF) signed an agreement (which the Government encloses) providing for the reinstatement of the trade union leader Mr. Jos Jorge Rigane and other trade union leaders, and making null and void the labour and criminal proceedings undertaken against him and the trade union; () according to the complainant, the judicial authorities ordered the reinstatement of Mr. Hugo Perosa at Alitalia S.A. in November ; () as regards the dismissal or transfer of trade union leaders in the province of Salta, according to the Government the situation of Mr. Luis Alberto Ramos, Mr. Vctor Angel Ravaza and Ms. Cristina Crdoba Ruiz have been resolved, as have those of Mr. Osvaldo Polo, Mr. Ral Vicente Avellaneda, Ms. Laura Alicia Lpez de Cabral, Mr. Ren Francisco Elejalde and Mr. Elio Fernndez Rodrguez, who were employed by the institution known at the time as the Bank of the Province of Salta and have come to an agreement with the bank and have halted any action taken against it. The Committee further notes that according to the Government, the judicial authorities have ordered the protective measure reinstating the trade union leader Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn; the Government emphasizes in this case the failure by the interested party to take action, as the file has been in the possession of Mr. Martn's lawyer since June , and he has so far not returned it to the judge. The Committee requests the",4,1998,Argentina
273,"Government to inform it of the final ruling on the case of the trade union leader Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn. The Committee further requests the Government to send its observations concerning the dismissal or transfer between  and  of the following trade union leaders, whose proceedings have not yet been concluded from the province of Salta (some of whom were from the municipality of General Gemes): Carlos Alberto Ibarra, Hugo Miguel Quispe, Rubn Antonio Saravia, Juana Isnardez de Ruiz, Reynaldo Eduardo Pistan, Ramona Escobar de Gutirrez, Juan Carlos Valdez, Miguel Angel Vittor, Ricardo Armiana Dohorman and Hctor Luis Cruz.
.The Committee notes from the allegations that some of the proceedings concerning dismissals or transfers have gone on for years. In this respect, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle according to which -Cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.  should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really effective. An excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination, and in particular a lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by the enterprise, constitute a denial of justice and therefore a denial of trade union rights of the person concerned.(See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. .)
.The Committee further observes that the problem of delays in the procedures concerning the dismissal or transfer of trade union leaders is related to the different levels of protection which the law affords to trade unions with ""official trade union status"" and to those which are ""merely registered"", and that the problem is worsened in the case of public employees, as they must exhaust administrative remedies before being able to bring cases before the judiciary. As regards the allegation concerning the insufficient legal protection of trade union leaders against anti-union discrimination, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement, which indicates that the legislation provides adequate protection from acts of anti-union discrimination committed against trade union leaders and members, even if in certain situations the delays may be excessive, as has been seen in the present case. The complainant organization contends that those trade union organizations which are ""merely registered"" suffer discrimination with respect to those which have ""official trade union status"" (which are more representative) insofar as the dismissal or worsening of the conditions of employment of the leaders of the latter require judicial authorization (under sections  and  of the Act concerning trade unions), while no such authorization is required for the former. In this respect, the Committee shares the opinion of the Committee of Experts, which reads as follows:With regard to the provisions of the Act respecting the privileges accorded to trade unions with trade union status (representing various collective interests other than through collective bargaining (section ), entitlement to have trade union dues deducted from wages (section ), tax exemption (section ), and special protection granted to trade union leaders (sections  and )), the Committee emphasizes that this accumulation of privileges could have a negative impact on workers in their choice of trade union membership. In this respect, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that  per cent of workers belong to trade union organizations with trade union status whereas only  per cent belong to organizations which have merely been registered. The Committee considers that this disparity could be interpreted as workers wishing to belong to organizations which are able to develop a real trade union activity through the nature and number of privileges granted under sections ,  and  of the Act, as is the case of trade union organizations with trade union status, thereby prejudicing unions which are merely registered and only able to represent the individual interests of their members, at their request, as provided for under section  of the Act.The Committee again recalls that the distinction of the most representative union should not result in the trade union being granted privileges, as already stated, extending beyond that of priority in representation for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments, or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words, the Committee shares the view of the Committee on Freedom of Association that this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organizations that are not recognized as being amongst the most representative organizations of the essential means of defending the occupational interests of their members, of organizing their administration and activities and formulating their programmes of action, provided for under Articles  and  of the Convention.The Committee also recalls that when legislation confers on the most representative trade unions certain privileges in connection with the defence of their occupational interests, by virtue of which they alone are in a position to act effectively, the granting of such privileges should not be made subject to such conditions as to influence unduly the choice of workers regarding the organization to which they intend to belong. (See Report of the Committee of Experts, Report III (Part A), , p. .)
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that in affording legal protection to trade union leaders against dismissal and other prejudicial acts, the legislation does not discriminate against trade union organizations which are ""merely registered"" with respect to those which enjoy ""official trade union status"".
.As regards the revocation through administrative channels of the registration of the FETERA trade union, the Committee notes that the Government states that the first instance judicial authority cancelled the revocation and ordered the registration to take place, and that its ruling was appealed before the Supreme Court of Justice. The Committee observes that according to the first instance judicial decision, which the Government encloses, the administrative revocation of the registry was due to the fact that the federation in question was composed of four constituent trade unions which were entirely different in nature (two enterprise unions, a sectoral union and an occupational union), which was supposedly prohibited by the law. In this respect, the Committee wishes to point out that it is for the statutes of the federations of a branch of activity to determine the number and type of organizations which it comprises, and that the revocation of the registration of an organization through administrative channels and the legal voiding of that organization is equivalent to an administrative dissolution thereof, which is contrary to Article  of Convention No. . Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the administrative authority withdraw its appeal against the decision of the first instance, which ordered that the FETERA trade union be registered, and to keep it informed of any decisions or rulings adopted in connection with this case.
.Lastly, as regards the allegations concerning the persecution of the State Workers' Association (ATE) trade union by the authorities of the province of Santiago del Estero through criminal charges brought against trade union leaders and the unjust retention of members' dues, the Committee notes the Government's statements to the effect that the criminal proceedings were not initiated by the authorities, but rather by a group of trade union leaders, against other leaders who were accused of defrauding the union, and that it has been proved in other proceedings that the payments of trade union contributions (dues) were forwarded to the union by the province.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the final decision concerning the dismissal of the trade union leader, Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn (reinstated for the time being under a protective measure).(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the dismissal or transfer between  and  of the following trade union leaders from the province of Salta (some of whom were from the municipality of General Gemes), whose proceedings have not yet been concluded: Carlos Alberto Ibarra, Hugo Miguel Quispe, Rubn Antonio Saravia, Juana Isnardez de Ruiz, Reynaldo Eduardo Pistan, Ramona Escobar de Gutirrez, Juan Carlos Valdez, Miguel Angel Vittor, Ricardo Armiana Dohorman and Hctor Luis Cruz.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the legislation ensuring the legal protection of trade union leaders against dismissal and other prejudicial acts does not discriminate against the leaders of organizations which are merely registered with respect to the leaders of those which have official trade union status.(d) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the administrative authority withdraws its appeal against the decision of the first instance judicial authority which ordered the trade union registration of the FETERA trade union, and to keep it informed of any decision or ruling adopted with respect to this case.",2,1998,Argentina
274,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Association of Aeronautical Personnel (APA) dated  November . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  and  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the Association of Aeronautical Personnel (APA) alleges that the enterprise Aerolneas Argentina S.A. (Argentine Airlines Ltd.) set up a controlled cargo-handling undertaking (Aerohandling) to which workers of another enterprise operating at airports were transferred. After the APA decided to begin negotiations with the company with a view to concluding a collective agreement, the company, after much procrastination, delay and obstruction of the negotiations, finally appointed representatives who, however, did not respond to the proposal put forward by the trade union organization, did not meet with union representatives and did not recognize the union's rights.
.The complainant organization adds that during the period of the negotiations, the company dismissed the union official, Sergio Irigoyen, who had been participating in the negotiations.
.In its communications of  May and  and  October , the Government states that the dispute between the enterprise Aerohandling and the Association of Aeronautical Personnel (APA) ended with the signing of an agreement between the two parties; the trade union delegate Mr. Irigoyen had the agreement officially registered.
.As regards the dismissal of Sergio Irigoyen, the Government supplies the following: () a copy of the ruling (No. ) handed down by the National Labour Court of First Instance which excludes the union delegate from the terms of the guarantee set out in section  of National Act No.  (""fuero sindical""); in the reasons given for the ruling, reference is made to the fact that the defendant did not contest the notification of the charge made against him by the employer enterprise (obstructing the work of other workers, verbal and physical assault, etc.), and consequently none of the allegations made by the enterprise and cited to justify the action taken against Mr. Irigoyen could be deemed to have been contested; () a copy of the decision by the Appeal Court concerning the appeal lodged by Mr. Irigoyen against the ruling of the lower court; this decision confirms the original ruling and states, among other reasons given for the decision, that Mr. Irigoyen says nothing concerning the events of  October  in which he was involved; () a copy of the court ruling which notes the fact that Mr. Irigoyen withdraws his action against the employer enterprise for reinstatement; the ruling notes that Mr. Irigoyen expressly withdraws the action and waives any claim in respect of the measures taken by the company, which implies tacit recognition that the company is in the right.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that the company Aerohandling obstructed and delayed the negotiations of a collective agreement and, during the period of the talks, dismissed a trade union delegate (Sergio Irigoyen) who was taking part in them.
.As regards the allegation concerning the obstructive attitude of the company Aerohandling during the negotiations of a collective agreement, the Committee notes with interest the Government's statement to the effect that the dispute has ended with the signature of an agreement between the parties. This being the case, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of this allegation.
.As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of the trade union delegate Sergio Irigoyen during the period of collective negotiations in which he was participating at the company Aerohandling, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that Mr. Irigoyen expressly withdrew his action for reinstatement before the judicial authority. The Committee also notes that previously, Mr. Irigoyen did not, when appearing before courts of various instance, contest the charges made against him by the employer enterprise (obstructing the work of other workers, verbal and physical assaults, etc.), nor did he respond expressly to the allegations made against him. This being the case, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1997,Argentina
275,".The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras. -], where it requested the Government:(a) to keep it informed of the charges brought against the members of the CTA of Cutral-Co, Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristan Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristan Valle and Angel Lucero and of the length of their detention;(b) to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial investigations as regards the allegations on: () the assault on ATE delegate Mr. Jorge Villalba, on  June  at Lans; () the death threat made against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the administrative committee of ATE-Lans; () the threat against the ATE delegate at the Arturo Melo Hospital, Ms. Ana Mara Luguercho on  June ; () the death threat against the ATE-Lans delegate, Mr. Daniel Saavedra; () the death threat against the general secretary of ATE-San Martn, Mr. Vctor Bordiera; and () the threat against the deputy-general delegate of ATE-General Rodrguez district, Mr. Ricardo Caffieri;(c) to investigate the allegations concerning the attack on the home of the deputy secretary of ATE, national branch, Mr. Juan Gonzles, the attack and looting in July  of the ATE premises in Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya, and the request by the Governor of Neuqun province to withdraw legal recognition from the state employees and teaching unions (ATE and ATEN which are affiliated with the CTA), and to keep it informed of their outcome;(d) to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial inquiry into the killing of the worker Teresa Rodrguez by police officers during a demonstration organized on  April  in Neuqun province in protest against unemployment.
.In communications of  and  March , the Government indicates that: () the national Government democratically elected which has assumed its functions on  December , has once again officially transmitted the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee in this case to the provincial governments involved, a large number of which have also been confirmed in their functions through democratic means. That being the case, it is hoped that this initiative by the new national authorities will lead to a better appreciation of the Committee's conclusions and recommendations, in the provinces where the facts occurred; () the police and judiciary authorities have launched an inquiry concerning the alleged attack and looting of the ATE premises in Comodoro Rovadavia, in July ; that inquiry is on hold, pending the discovery of new evidence; () it has been decided to put on hold, for lack of evidence, the inquiry into the assault on Mr. Jorge Villalba (ATE delegate), and to suspend the inquiry into the death threat made against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the administrative committee of ATE-Lans.
.The Committee takes note of this information. It hopes that the new Government will transmit in the near future all the information requested when this case was last examined in June , so that the pending issues may be fully examined.
.The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (June )).

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When previously examining the case, which dealt with allegations of killing, detention, physical assaults and death threats against trade unionists and trade union leaders, as well as break-ins in trade union premises and trade unionists' homes and request to withdraw legal recognition, the Committee made the following recommendations (see th Report, para. (a) and (b)):-- With regard to the allegation concerning the killing of Ms. Teresa Rodrguez by police officers during a demonstration organized on  April  in Neuqun Province in protest against unemployment, the Committee hopes that the judicial proceedings currently in progress will clarify the facts, apportion responsibility and impose sanctions on the person or persons responsible, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.-- Concerning the allegations relating to: () the attacks on  and  May  on the ATE premises in Neuqun Province; () the break-ins at the homes and subsequent detention by the police on  June  of members of the CTA of Cutral-Co (Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristan Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristan Valle and Angel Lucero) and the legal proceedings initiated against three of them (Rodrguez, Botron and Parra); () the assault on ATE delegate, Mr. Jorge Villalba, on  June  in Lans; () the death threat made against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the administrative committee of ATE-Lans, on  June ; () the threat against the ATE delegate at the Arturo Melo Hospital, Ms. Ana Mara Luguercho, on  June ; () the death threat against the ATE-Lans delegate, Mr. Daniel Saavedra; () the death threat against the general secretary of ATE-San Martn, Mr. Vctor Bordiera; () the threat against the deputy general delegate of ATE-General Rodrguez District, Mr. Ricardo Caffieri, on  July ; () the attack on the home of the deputy secretary of ATE (national branch), Mr. Juan Gonzlez; () the attack and looting in July  of the ATE premises in Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya; and () the request by the Governor of Neuqun Province to withdraw legal recognition from the state employees and teaching unions (ATE and ATEN), which are affiliated to the CTA, the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided full information on these allegations and urges it to provide its observations as quickly as possible on all the allegations, indicating expressly the status of the complaints before the police or judicial authorities to which the complainants refer. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure protection for the CTA and ATE and for trade unionists who have been threatened.
.In its communications of  October ,  April and  May , the Government provided the following information in connection with the events which occurred under the jurisdiction of Neuqun Province:-- concerning the complaint that an incendiary bomb was set off in the premises of the Association of State Workers of Cutral-Co, the Government encloses Memorandum No.  (CCO) stating that the police station of the th district of Cutral-Co registered the relevant complaint lodged by Miguel Dante Alvarez and acting upon a telephone call, went on the spot to ascertain that there had been a fire in the ATE premises and, having observed the damage (in this case only ""damage to glass in the entrance door and damage caused by smoke to the premises""), took all the necessary measures to try and clarify the events, such as carrying out an expert's appraisal of the premises by competent staff. Any information in this respect will be communicated to the Committee as soon as possible;-- concerning the complaint that ""a group of unidentified persons fired shots at the front of the premises"" of the ATE Cutral-Co headquarters, the Government encloses Memorandum No.  (CCO) stating that Celso Faban Quesada lodged the relevant complaint with the th police station of Cutral-Co specifically pointing out that ""nobody was suspected"". The police took the appropriate measures and initiated preliminary investigations. Any further information on this matter will be communicated to the Committee in the near future;-- the Government points out that, concerning both occurrences, the corresponding judicial proceedings were carried out by the Court of Criminal Investigation and that it was clear that the police authorities had acted promptly and taken the necessary procedures. Similarly, the Government states that the relevant authorities are not sparing any effort to try and cast light immediately on such regrettable occurrences. Any progress made and further information acquired with respect to the events mentioned above will be communicated immediately to the Committee;-- concerning the allegation that on the night of  June  a group of about  police officers had broken into the homes of members of the Central Association of Argentine Workers (CTA) of Cutral-Co, and other allegations (arrest of persons without informing them of where they were being taken, break-ins during the night rather than the day, break-ins by persons wearing hoods, violence used during the break-ins against members of the detainees' families, lack of jurisdiction of the police to break into the premises, arrest without any legitimate charge being made by the competent legal authority), the Government encloses a copy of Official Note No.  (DSICCO) giving an account of the events and instances which occurred on  June  as a result of the visit of a government group headed by the Vice-Governor of Neuqun Province; copy of Judicial Proceedings No.  (CCO-J); copy of Memorandum No.  (CCO); note drawn up by the head office of the security services of Cutral-Co and officials of the Security",1,1997,Argentina

According to the abovementioned documentation and in the light of the well known events which occurred in June  in Cutral-Co, it may be deduced that: () as a result of a serious dispute between the government authorities and workers in the Cutral-Co District in Neuqun Province, a group made up of officials from the highest ranks of government was dispatched to try and find a swift solution to the workers' claims. On the day in question, it proved impossible, after tough negotiations, to reach a satisfactory solution for the parties, at which point the group decided to leave the building in which the meetings were being held when the building was virtually taken over by demonstrators. As may be ascertained from the documentation submitted ""shots were fired from small calibre firearms wielded by the demonstrators"" who were gathered outside the building and there was ""a massive assault on the municipal building which was practically destroyed"", resulting in injuries to Police Superintendent Oscar Pincheira, Sergeant Miguel Acosta and Officer Patricio Mamani. In view of such regrettable incidents, corresponding legal proceedings were initiated with a view to establishing that offences might have been committed, determining the responsibility and identifying those presumed guilty. In view of the above circumstances, a magistrate was instructed to carry out investigations; in doing so he took measures authorized under law to try and establish the objective truth, which include the break-in and arrest of anyone suspected of having committed an offence; () it is clear from the documentation submitted that the break-in of the home and arrest of Sandro Botron during the day was in full compliance with the orders issued by the competent authority and that the police carrying out these actions were fully competent to carry out these tasks and fulfilled all the necessary legal requirements. Furthermore, attempts were made to avoid calling in the police and they were only called in as a last resort and, to a minimum extent, to ensure compliance with the procedures ordered. In fact, the person injured during the proceedings was Police Superintendent Carlos Salazar and, as the police had taken the precaution of filming the events, a family member of Sandro Botron destroyed the camera. In short, the Government dismisses as totally unfounded the allegations made to the Committee that there were ""flaws in the proceedings"" liable, in any way, to undermine rights granted to citizens which the Argentine Government guarantees and protects. As regards the allegations concerning break-ins at the homes and arrest of Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristan Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Christan Valle and Angel Lucero, members of the CTA of Cutral-Co, as well as the allegations concerning the legal proceedings initiated against three of them, the judge responsible for the cases submitted a report to which reference is made above: () as regards the events that occurred on  and  June  he decided to proceed to an inquiry led by a competent judge because of the considerable damage, looting and fire suffered by the municipal building, the destruction of the car of a senior municipal executive officer and gun shots, etc.; () these were proceedings engaged in accordance with the Constitution and the law and done pursuant to a written order issued by the competent judge. As regards Ms. Teresa Rodrguez's death which occurred during the events of  April  in the Neuqun Province, the judge is still investigating in order to collect the evidence which would allow shedding light on these regrettable events. Also, the police officer Hugo Alberto Rudof will continue to be associated with this case.
.Lastly, the Government stated that, as regards the events that occurred in Buenos Aires Province and concerning the alleged threat and physical assault against trade unionists of ATE-Lans and alleged threat against trade unionists of ATE-San Martn, Quilmes, the Buenos Aires Province State Secretary responsible for labour affairs indicated that no administration measure was brought against the perpetrators of these alleged violations of freedom of association principles but that however complaints brought before the inquiring judge and the police are actually being investigated even if they are not supported with sufficient evidence; they are still at the instruction stage, i.e. the collection of evidence.
.The Committee notes that the allegations that had remained pending when it examined this case at its June  meeting concerned attacks and break-ins of trade union headquarters, the break-in of trade union members' homes and the subsequent arrest of these members, assaults and death threats against trade unionists, and the request to withdraw legal recognition of two trade unions. Similarly, the Committee notes that during its last examination of the case, it had requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of judicial proceedings concerning the killing of Teresa Rodrguez by police officers during a demonstration organized on  April  in Neuqun Province.
.With respect to the allegation concerning the attack on the premises of the ATE trade union in Neuqun Province on  and  May , the Committee notes the Government's statements to the effect that: () concerning the complaint that an incendiary bomb was set off in the premises of the Association of State Workers of Cutral-Co, the police station of the th district of Cutral-Co registered the relevant complaint from Miguel Dante Alvarez and, acting upon a telephone call, went on the spot to ascertain that there had been a fire in the ATE headquarters and, having observed the damage, took all the necessary measures to try and clarify the events, such as carrying out an expert's appraisal of the premises by competent staff; and () concerning the complaint that ""a group of unidentified persons fired shots at the front of the premises"" of the ATE headquarters in Cutral-Co, Celso Fabin Quesada lodged the relevant complaint with the police station of the th district of Cutral-Co, specifically pointing out that ""nobody was suspected"", and that the police took the appropriate measures and initiated preliminary investigations. The Committee also notes that the Government maintains that in both cases it carried out the necessary judicial proceedings and that the relevant authorities are sparing no effort to try and cast light immediately on such regrettable events. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way.
.With respect to the allegation concerning the break-ins into unionists' homes and subsequent detention on  June  of members of the Cutral-Co branch of the CTA (Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristin Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristin Valle and Angel Lucero) and the legal proceedings initiated against three of them (Rodrguez, Botron and Parra), the Committee notes the Government's statements to the effect that: () as a result of a serious dispute between the government authorities and the workers in the district of Cutral-Co, Neuqun Province, a group made up of officials from the highest ranks of government was dispatched with a view to finding a swift solution to the workers' claims and that after serious negotiations it had been impossible to reach a satisfactory solution for the parties, at which point the group decided to leave the building in which the meetings were being held when the building was virtually taken over by demonstrators; according to the Government, shots were fired from small calibre firearms by the demonstrators who were gathered outside the building and that a massive assault on the municipal building almost destroyed it, resulting in injuries to three police officers; as a result of such regrettable instances, legal proceedings had been initiated with a view to establishing that offences might have been committed, determining responsibility and identifying those presumed guilty. A judicial inquiry had been set in motion in accordance with measures authorized by the law in order to try and establish the objective truth, which include the break-in and arrest of anyone who might be suspected of having committed a crime; and () the break-in at the homes of trade unionists Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristan Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristan Valle and Angel Lucero, members of the CTA, and their subsequent arrest were carried out in compliance with orders issued by the competent authority, during the day, by police officers fully competent to carry out this task and in accordance with all the requirements provided for under the legislation to guarantee rights extended to all citizens. It points out that the procedure was engaged in accordance with the Constitution and the law and done pursuant to a written order issued by the competent judge and attempts were made to avoid calling in the police and that they were only called in as a last resort and, to a minimum extent, to ensure compliance with the procedures ordered. It is stressed that a police officer sustained injuries as a result of this action.
.In this respect, whilst noting that the Government points out that the break-in to the homes of trade unionists Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristan",1,1997,Argentina
277,"Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristan Valle and Angel Lucero and their subsequent arrest was carried out with a warrant, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the situation of the four trade unionists, in particular with respect to the charges brought against them and the length of their detention.
.As regards the killing of Ms. Teresa Rodrguez by police officers during a demonstration held on  April  in the Neuqun Province, the Committee notes that according to the Government the judicial authorities are still investigating. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.
.However, the Committee notes that the Government has not provided information on the investigation concerning allegations which remained pending following its last examination of the case: assault on ATE delegate, Jorge Villalba, on  June  in Lans; the death threat against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the administrative committee of ATE-Lans, on  June ; the threat made on  June  against Ms. Ana Mara Luguercho, ATE delegate at the Arturo Melo Hospital; the death threat against the ATE-Lans delegate, Daniel Saavedra; the death threat against Vctor Bordiera, general secretary of ATE-San Martn; the threat against Mr. Ricardo Caffieri, deputy general delegate of ATE-General Rodrguez District, on  July . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.
.As regards the allegations which remain pending and which concern the attack on the home of the deputy secretary of ATE (National Branch), Mr. Juan Gonzlez, the attack and looting in July  of the ATE premises in Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya and the request by the Governor of Neuqun Province for the withdrawal of legal recognition from the state employees and teaching unions (ATE and ATEN), which are affiliated to the CTA, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on these matters. In this respect, recalling the importance it attaches to an independent inquiry, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that investigations are carried out on all these allegations and to keep it informed on the outcome of these investigations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the charges brought against the members of the CTA of Cutral-Co, Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristan Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristan Valle and Angel Lucero and of the length of their detention.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial investigations as regards the allegations on: () the assault on ATE delegate Mr. Jorge Villalba, on  June  at Lans; () the death threat made against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the administrative committee of ATE-Lans; () the threat against the ATE delegate at the Arturo Melo Hospital, Ms. Ana Mara Luguercho on  June ; () the death threat against the ATE-Lans delegate, Mr. Daniel Saavedra; () the death threat against the general secretary of ATE-San Martn, Mr. Vctor Bordiera; and () the threat against the deputy general delegate of ATE-General Rodrguez district, Mr Ricardo Caffieri.(c) As regards the allegations still pending after the last examination of the case and concerning the attack on the home of the deputy secretary of ATE, National Branch, Mr. Juan Gonzles, the attack and looting in July  of the ATE premises in Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya, and the request by the Governor of Neuqun Province to withdraw legal recognition from the state employees and teaching unions (ATE and ATEN which are affiliated with the CTA), the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to investigate these allegations and to keep it informed of their outcome.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial inquiry into the killing of the worker Teresa Rodrguez by police offices during a demonstration organized on  April  in Neuqun Province in protest against unemployment.
.The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) dated  August . Subsequently, in a communication dated  October , the Central Association of Argentine Workers (CTA) supported the complaint and presented new allegations.
.The Government sent its partial observations in a communications dated  February and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  August , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) states that the worrying rise in the unemployment rate has resulted in greater levels of social unrest in Argentina, and that in order to honour its commitments and obligations to the workers, trade union leaders have augmented the number of measures protesting against the national authorities which in turn, in spite of the international Conventions signed by Argentina, have led to a disturbing increase in acts of anti-union discrimination. Specifically, the CLAT alleges that in a number of provinces and regions, the following acts of violence have been committed:-- Neuqun Province. In this region, which has been affected by very high levels of unemployment following the privatization of the National Oil Company (YPF) and the associated lay-offs, a number of trade union leaders affiliated to the Central Association of Argentine Workers (CTA) have been the victims of acts which directly violate the right to freedom of association. Specifically, during a demonstration organized on  April  by workers in the region to protest against unemployment and the anti-social policies implemented by the Government, Ms. Teresa Rodrguez was shot to death. All the sources consulted state that she was killed by a shot fired by a police officer during the mass police action against the demonstrators. Following the death, the Association of State Workers (ATE) set up a human rights commission in its premises to monitor the investigation into the killing. On  March , these premises were the target of an attack, and on the th of the same month, a group of unidentified persons fired shots at the front of the premises. On the night of  June , a group of about  police officers broke into the homes of the following members of the Central Association of Argentine Workers (CTA) of Cutral-Co: Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristin Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristin Valle and Angel Lucero. The trade unionists were taken from their homes without being informed of where they were being taken. The unlawful nature of the detentions is aggravated by the fact that, according to the testimony of various members of the detainees' families, some of the police officers involved in the operation wore hoods, struck children and old people, and used a disproportionate degree of force. According to confirmed reports, the officers were not from the Cutral-Co police department and had no jurisdiction in that city. The detainees were held at different times in different unknown locations. Subsequently, one police department claimed to be holding them in detention but declined to let anyone see them. After about  hours, following intense protests, the district criminal court judge proceeded to clarify the legal situation of the detainees and charged three of them (Cristin Rodrguez, Sandro Botron and Beatriz Parra) with committing an offence contrary to article bis of the Penal Code which provides for the punishment of members of a legitimate association which commits unlawful acts. The charge was based solely on the ""evidence"" of statements made by a number of police officials who accused the trade unionists of having participated in protest demonstrations and obstructed roads in the district, to demand the implementation of the agreement signed by the Government giving work to unemployed people in the area. The gravity of this illegal act is also underlined by the fact that only one legitimate charge was brought against three of the detainees. Another irregularity in legal terms was the fact that the detainees were conditionally released after being warned not to participate in any march or demonstration during the following days. This is particularly significant, bearing in mind the fact that a protest march had been due to take place  hours later in protest against the failure of the Government to keep its promises to provide jobs for the unemployed.-- Buenos Aires Province -- Lans. From  June  onwards there was a series of physical attacks and threats against delegates and workers of the Lans section of the Association of State Workers (ATE): () on  June at approximately  o'clock as he was leaving his place of work (the Evita Hospital in Lans), the ATE delegate in that establishment, Mr. Jorge Villalba, was stopped by three individuals, one of whom wore a balaclava while the other two also concealed their faces. They proceeded to abuse him verbally for his trade union activities and shot him in the",1,1997,Argentina
278,"left hand. Mr. Villalba had to undergo surgery, the results of which are still not known. The incident was reported to the first police precinct of Lans; () on  June  at approximately  a.m., the mother of Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the Administrative Committee of ATE-Lans employed in the laboratory department of the Evita Hospital, received by telephone a death threat against her daughter. The incident was reported to Criminal Court No.  of the district of Lomas de Zamora; () on  June  at about . a.m., Ms. Ana Mara Luguercho, an ATE delegate employed at the Arturo Melo Hospital, was stopped a few yards from her home by two men in a car of unknown make who detained and threatened her; () the ATE-Lans delegate, Mr. Daniel Saavedra, received a death threat by telephone at his home; the caller appeared to know all the members of his family and details of his allegations. The incident was reported to the criminal court of the Lomas de Zamora Judicial Department.-- Buenos Aires Province -- San Martn. The General Secretary of the ATE-San Martn, Mr. Vctor Bordiera, received an anonymous death threat by telephone at his home. The San Martn regional unit of the Buenos Aires Province police took note of the report of the incident and in turn reported it to the criminal court of the San Martn Judicial Department.-- Buenos Aires Province -- General Rodrguez district. On  July , an unsigned letter was received at the home of Mr. Ricardo Caffieri, containing threats against the Deputy General Delegate of ATE for General Rodrguez district. That night and the following day, he received similar threats by telephone at his home. The incident was reported by the General Secretary to the local police station, which immediately reported the matter to the district judge.-- Attack on the home of the Deputy Secretary of the ATE (National-Federal Capital). At dawn on Saturday,  June , the home of the Deputy Secretary of the ATE (National Branch), Mr. Juan Gonzlez, came under attack. The attackers broke down the front door of the premises, which were not occupied by Mr. Gonzlez at the time. The nature of the attack was evidenced by the fact that the attackers did not remove anything of value or indeed anything else from the premises. The operational capabilities of the attackers was illustrated by the fact that Mr. Gonzlez lives right in the centre of the capital, only a block away from the district police station and close to the National Congress, in an area which enjoys a high level of police protection.-- Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya districts. At dawn on  July , unknown persons attacked the premises of the ATE (Comodoro Rivadavia section). The premises were looted. At the time of the attack, a police patrol was located less than  metres away but claims to have seen no suspicious activity, although the attackers removed all the furniture, computers and the fax machine from the premises. The premises of the Goya section of the ATE were also looted. In that incident, only minor articles were removed, fixtures were destroyed and graffiti drawn on the walls. Both cases are being investigated by the criminal courts of Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya districts.
.In its communication dated  October , the Central Association of Argentine Workers (CTA) alleges that the attacks against the freedom of association of the CTA and its members in Neuqun Province have intensified and that the Governor of the province has requested the withdrawal of legal recognition from the state employees' and teaching unions (ATE and ATEN) which were affiliated to the CTA. The complainants maintain that the request is clearly an attempt to retaliate against the trade unions for the protests and stoppages agreed by them following a government decision to cut wages by  per cent. The complainants explain that during these legitimate union activities, which were conducted in accordance with all the relevant legal provisions, there were isolated disturbances caused by trouble-making elements that had nothing to do with the organizations concerned.
.In its communications of  February and  May , the Government states that, with regard to the killing of Ms. Teresa Rodrguez in Neuqun Province, an inquiry has been instituted by the Criminal Investigation Court of Cutral-Co, and that this investigation is at the preliminary stage of gathering evidence with a view to identifying the person or persons responsible for the killing and that police officer Hugo Alberto Rudolf has been indicted. Evidence from witnesses, ballistic evidence and evidence obtained from visual inspection of the scene have been obtained and the defence is presently appealing the indictment. Any new developments in the matter will be communicated immediately to the Committee.
.The Government states that, with regard to the incidents reported to have taken place within the jurisdiction of Buenos Aires Province -- Lans, Lujan and General San Martin -- information has been requested from the Under Secretariat of Labour of Buenos Aires Province (the competent body for labour matters within the province). According to that body, no complaints have been received from the victims or from any trade union. Nevertheless, the appropriate inquiries are being carried out with the police of Buenos Aires Province and any information will be communicated to the Committee as quickly as possible. Finally, the Government states that, as concerns the incidents taking place in the provinces of Santa Cruz and Neuqun, it is awaiting the information requested from the respective governments. As concerns Ana Mara Luguercho, the proceedings currently under way in Lans are not related to the allegations.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainants allege the killing of a worker during a protest demonstration, the detention of trade unionists and break-ins at their homes, physical assaults and death threats against trade unionists, attacks on trade union headquarters and premises and on trade unionists' homes, and the request to withdraw legal recognition of a trade union in retaliation for demonstrations and stoppages.
.Firstly, the Committee notes with concern the gravity of all the allegations presented and regrets that the Government has only provided partial information.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the killing of the worker Ms. Teresa Rodrguez by police officers during a demonstration organized on  April  in Neuqun Province in protest against unemployment, the Committee notes that the Government states that it has initiated judicial proceedings, a police official has been indicted in this matter and the indictment is being appealed.
.The Committee deeply deplores the killing of Ms. Teresa Rodrguez and cannot refrain from noting that the Government confirms the involvement of the police in the incidents in which the worker concerned died. Under these circumstances, the Committee hopes that the judicial proceedings will clarify the incidents, apportion responsibility and impose sanctions on the person or persons responsible, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.
.The Committee also recalls that in June  it examined allegations of acts of violence against trade unionists who had participated in a protest demonstration in which a worker had also died. On that occasion, the Committee recalled that ""the authorities should resort to the use of force only in situations where law and order is seriously threatened. The intervention of the forces of law and order should be in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence when controlling demonstrations which might result in a disturbance of the peace"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee requested the Government ""to instruct the police authorities in future to guarantee the exercise of the right of trade unions to demonstrate without being the object of disproportionate measures or excessive violence"" (see th Report, Case No. , para. ). The Committee requests the Government in future to ensure that these principles are respected.
.The Committee notes that the other allegations presented in this case refer specifically to: () the attacks that took place on  and  May  on the union premises of ATE in which a human rights commission had been set up to monitor the investigation into the killing of Ms. Teresa Rodrguez; () the break-ins into unionists' homes and subsequent detention on  June  of members of the Cutral-Co branch of the CTA (Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristin Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristin Valle and Angel Lucero) and the legal proceedings initiated against three of them (Rodrguez, Botrol and Parra); () the assault on ATE delegate Jorge Villalba, who was wounded in the left hand by a gunshot on  June  in Lans (the incident was reported to the Lans police); () the death threat against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the Administrative Committee of",1,1997,Argentina
279,"ATE-Lans, on  June  (a complaint was made to the judicial authorities); () the threat made on  June  against Ms. Ana Mara Luguercho, ATE delegate at the Arturo Melo Hospital; () the death threat against the ATE-Lans delegate, Daniel Saavedra (a complaint was made to the judicial authorities); () the death threat against Vctor Bordiera, General Secretary of ATE-San-Martn (a complaint was made to the judicial authorities); () the threat against Mr. Ricardo Caffieri, Deputy General Delegate of ATE-General Rodrguez district, on  July  (a complaint was made to the judicial authorities); () the attack on the home of the Deputy Secretary of ATE (National Branch), Mr. Juan Gonzlez; () the attack and looting in July  of the ATE premises in Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya; and () the request by the Governor of Neuqun Province for the withdrawal of legal recognition from the state employees' and teaching unions (ATE and ATEN) which are affiliated to the CTA, as retaliation for the demonstrations and work stoppages carried out by those trade unions (the complainants attached to their complaint a resolution by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security dated  October  which states that ""the permanent legal service of the Ministry of Labour will proceed, in accordance with article  of Act , to seek judicial annulment of the legal recognition granted to the trade union entity Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Educacin de Neuqun"").
.In this context, the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided information on all the allegations, indicating only that information has been requested from the Under-Secretariat of Labour of Buenos Aires Province (that body has stated that no complaint has been received from the victims or from any trade union), that appropriate inquiries are being made with the police of Buenos Aires Province and that it has requested information from the governments of the provinces of Santa Cruz and Neuqun on the incidents which occurred there.
.In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to provide its observations as quickly as possible on all the pending allegations (provinces of Buenos Aires -- Santa Cruz and Neuqun) stating expressly the status of the complaints before the police or judicial authorities to which reference has been made by the complainants. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure protection for the CTA and ATE and for the trade unionists who have been threatened.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a. With regard to the allegation concerning the killing of Ms. Teresa Rodrguez by police officers during a demonstration organized on  April  in Neuqun Province in protest against unemployment, the Committee hopes that the judicial proceedings currently in progress will clarify the facts, apportion responsibility and impose sanctions on the person or persons responsible, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.b. Concerning the allegations relating to: () the attacks on  and  May  on the ATE premises in Neuqun Province; () the break-ins at the homes and subsequent detention by the police on  June  of members of the CTA of Cutral-Co (Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristin Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristin Valle and Angel Lucero) and the legal proceedings initiated against three of them (Rodrguez, Botron and Parra); () the assault on ATE delegate Mr. Jorge Villalba, on  June  in Lans; () the death threat made against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the Administrative Committee of ATE-Lans, on  June ; () the threat against the ATE delegate at the Arturo Melo Hospital, Ms. Ana Mara Luguercho on  June ; () the death threat against the ATE-Lans delegate, Mr. Daniel Saavedra; () the death threat against the General Secretary of ATE-San-Martn, Mr. Vctor Bordiera; () the threat against the Deputy General Delegate of ATE-General Rodrguez district, Mr. Ricardo Caffieri, on  July ; () the attack on the home of the Deputy Secretary of ATE (National Branch), Mr. Juan Gonzlez; () the attack and looting in July  of the ATE premises in Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya; and () the request by the Governor of Neuqun Province to withdraw legal recognition from the state employees' and teaching unions (ATE and ATEN), which are affiliated to the CTA, the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided full information on these allegations and urges it to provide its observations as quickly as possible on all the allegations, indicating expressly the status of the complaints before the police or judicial authorities to which the complainants refer. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure protection for the CTA and ATE and for trade unionists who have been threatened.",1,1997,Argentina
280,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication dated  April  from the Trade Union of National, Provincial, Municipal and Private Steam Generator Operators and allied Occupations (SCGVA). Subsequently, the complainant sent further information in another communication during June . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October  and  February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  April and June , the Trade Union of National, Provincial, Municipal and Private Steam Generator Operators and allied Occupations (SCGVA) states that it was established in  (as is apparent from the organization's Statutes which are attached to the complaint) and that, there being no other trade union organization for workers involved in this area of activity, it applied to the authorities in  for official trade union status but did not obtain an affirmative response. The complainant provides detailed information and abundant documentation on the administrative and judicial procedures which it had initiated, to no avail, to obtain official trade union status.
.Lastly, the complainant states that in , the United Trade Union of Workers and Employees of Crdoba (SUOEM) appealed to the administrative authorities to oppose the granting of official trade union status to the Trade Union of National, Provincial, Municipal and Private Steam Generator Operators and allied Occupations (SCGVA).
.In its communications of  October  and  February , the Government states that the complainant has been registered as a trade union since  but that it has not been granted official trade union status since it has not shown itself to be the most representative trade union. The Government attaches a Ministry of Labour report of March  according to which official trade union status has not been granted to the complainant because it does not comply with the requirement of section (b) of Act No.  concerning trade union associations (i.e. membership of more than  per cent of the workers whom the trade union wishes to represent). The Government also claims that in the Province of Crdoba, the most representative trade union to date is the United Trade Union of Workers and Employees of Crdoba (SUOEM), since virtually all workers involved with boilers, sterilizers, compressors, etc., are public municipal employees. Finally, the Government explains that the complainant did not even indicate whether it had  per cent of the workers as members which now it claims to represent.
.The Committee notes that the present allegations refer to the refusal to grant ""representative trade union status"" which the Trade Union of National, Provincial, Municipal and Private Steam Generator Operators and allied Occupations (SCGVA) has been requesting since  (under current legislation, only organizations which have representative status enjoy the right to enter into collective bargaining).
.The Committee notes that the reply and the supporting documentation sent by the Government indicates that it has not granted official trade union status to the complainant because: () it does not meet, nor has it made any indication of, the requirement of a membership of more than  per cent of the workers whom it wishes to represent (section (b) of Act No. ); and () the most representative trade union in the Province of Crdoba to date is the United Trade Union of Workers and Employees of Crdoba (SUOEM).
.In this connection, the Committee is unable in the light of available information to determine whether the membership of the complainant includes, as it claims to do, more than  per cent of the workers in its sector or whether or not it is the most representative organization, especially given that the allegations and the Government's reply do not indicate clearly the spheres of activity and geographical areas in which the complainant and the United Trade Union of Workers and Employees of Crdoba (SUOEM) exercise their right of representation.
.Under these circumstances, and bearing in mind the period that has elapsed since the last census of the complainant's membership (), the Committee requests the Government to carry out such a census with a view to determining which of the two trade union organizations in question (the SCGVA or the SUOEM) is the more representative. If it finds that the complainant is the more representative, the Committee requests the Government to grant it official trade union status which it has been seeking since .
.Similarly, noting that it has already had occasion to criticize the provisions of Act No.  (section ) which requires the petitioning association, in order to contest the trade union status of an existing association, to have a ""considerably higher"" number of members (see th Report, Case No. , paras.  to ), and that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has also objected to the provision in question (see the pertinent observation of the Committee of Experts, Report III, Part A, ), the Committee requests the Government to take steps to amend the provision in question so that the criterion for the representativeness of trade unions becomes a simple majority of members.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a. The Committee requests the Government to conduct a verification of membership percentages in order to determine which of the two trade union organizations in question (the Trade Union of National, Provincial, Municipal and Private Steam Generator Operators and allied Occupations (SCGVA) or the United Trade Union of Workers and Employees of Crdoba (SUOEM)) is the most representative. If it finds that the complainant is the most representative, the Committee requests the Government to grant it the official trade union status which it has been seeking since .b. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend section  of Act No.  concerning trade union associations, which requires the petitioning association, in order to contest the trade union status of an existing association, to have a ""considerably higher"" number of members, in such a way that the criterion for determining the representativeness of trade unions becomes a simple majority of members.",0,1997,Argentina
281,".The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )), when it requested the Government to take the necessary steps to repeal resolution No. /, issued by the Education Council of Ro Negro Province, allowing workers to be hired during a teachers' strike; and to ensure that the government of Ro Negro Province pay without delay to the UNTER trade union organization the union dues paid by its members which have been withheld since February  and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.In a communication dated  October , the Government states that the Ro Negro Provincial Education Council repealed resolution No. /, which had been criticized by the Committee, by resolution No. /. As regards the delay in paying UNTER the union dues paid by its members which had been withheld since February , the Government states further that the original debt when the new authorities of Ro Negro Province took office in December  amounted to $,., that payment had been delayed about four months, and that the debt currently owed could be broken down as follows: () $,. in dues paid for , to be settled by the General Treasury; and () $,. in dues corresponding to SAC, for the first half of  (the only debt owed for the current year).
.The Committee notes with satisfaction the repeal of resolution No. / of the Education Council of Ro Negro Province. As regards the withholding of trade union dues paid by UNTER members, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government and in particular the fact that it recognizes the existence of a debt to UNTER amounting to ,. pesos (equal to the same amount in United States dollars). In this respect, recalling that non-payment of trade union dues can result in serious financial difficulties for trade union organizations, the Committee again urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the government of Ro Negro Province pay without delay to the UNTER trade union organization the union dues paid by its members, according to a reasonable timetable drawn up in consultation with this trade union organization.
.The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Union of Education Workers of Ro Negro (UNTER) of August . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of August , the Union of Education Workers of Ro Negro (UNTER) objects to Resolution No. /, issued on  February  by the Ro Negro Provincial Education Council, concerning the recruitment of teachers to replace striking staff, and Decrees Nos. / and / issued by the Executive of Ro Negro province, regulating direct action by employees of the provincial public administration, decentralized bodies and autonomous bodies of the provincial Executive. The complainant states that the regulations at issue cannot be interpreted without taking into account the situation in law and in practice of provincial public employees, and that of education workers in particular. The complainant adds that public sector workers in Ro Negro do not receive their salaries in due time and in the prescribed form, that there are delays in payment of up to six months, in addition to which they suffer the consequences of structural adjustment programmes, which have affected teachers as follows: teaching hours have been cut, over , teachers have lost their jobs, grades have been eliminated and schools closed, etc.
.Specifically, the Resolution and Decrees at issue contain the following provisions:Resolution No. / of the Provincial Education CouncilCONSIDERING the possibility of direct action being taken by decision of teaching staff, and WHEREAS the continuity of educational services must be ensured; a political decision has been taken to recruit persons wishing to provide teaching services to replace those who may take part in the direct action; there are a large number of persons with professional and equivalent qualifications who are able to take on teaching hours and/or grades; in order to fill posts which would otherwise be unattended it is necessary to recruit persons voluntarily expressing the wish to work in the education sector: THE PROVINCIAL EDUCATION COUNCIL HEREBY RESOLVES THE FOLLOWING:Section . The registration of volunteers to provide teaching services in each regional department shall be authorized.Section . The following may register as volunteers: retired teachers, persons with professional and equivalent qualifications who shall be appointed to fill teaching posts in accordance with the basic principles laid down in the present resolution ...Decree No. /THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE OF RIO NEGRO HEREBY DECREES THAT:Section .

The decision to take direct action shall be adopted by the executive bodies of recognized trade union organizations, in accordance with the procedure laid down in the by-laws of each trade union organization. Where there is no provision to this effect in the by-laws, the measure shall be approved by the provincial executive of the trade union.Section . A trade union organization that has decided to take direct action shall, with at least three days' notice, formally communicate this decision to the provincial Undersecretariat for Labour, which shall verify compliance with the provisions laid down in section  of this Decree. In the notification made to the Undersecretariat for Labour, the trade union organization shall communicate the nature and/or form of the action envisaged, its duration, the sectors of the public administration affected, the reason, the trade union body which took the decision and a certified copy of the record of such decision.Section . Within  hours of receiving the communication referred to in the preceding section, the Undersecretariat for Labour may decide to hold the necessary hearings to examine the reasons for the direct action. Where the Undersecretariat for Labour decides to hold hearings, attendance shall be mandatory for those persons who have been formally notified.Section . Any direct action taken by workers, whether as a single individual, group of individuals or collectively, which has not been formally decided by the trade union concerned in accordance with section  of the present Decree shall entail the applicable disciplinary sanctions under the regulations in force for provincial public employees, as well as the termination of temporary contracts or those of substitute or temporary teachers. Likewise, following disciplinary proceedings, such sanctions shall be applied to persons carrying out direct action called by the trade union organization of which they are members, without the latter having complied with the procedure laid down in this Decree.Section . Where workers fail to carry out all or part of their service, by reason of direct action, whether such action has been formally decided upon or not, and whether or not they are present at the workplace, and where thauthorities of the central public administration bodies, autonomous bodies or decentralized bodies of the provincial state, in order to carry out their tasks, and consequently could not engage in the work assigned to them, they shall not be paid any remuneration.Section .

Likewise, following disciplinary proceedings, such sanctions shall be applied to persons carrying out direct action called by the trade",3,1996,Argentina
282,"union organization of which they are members, without the latter having complied with the procedure laid down in this Decree.""
.The complainant states further that on  June  the provincial Undersecretariat for Labour informed UNTER of a notification received from the Provincial Education Council (CPE) in which the employer denounced all the collective agreements that had been signed and approved, the reasons given being that the agreements that had been approved failed to stipulate the term of the agreement; changes in circumstances; and the fact that the collegiate body had not endorsed the agreements. The complainant adds that after denouncing the agreements, the CPE issued resolutions concerning the conditions of work of teachers for which provision had been made in the collective agreements (substantial changes in hours of work, elimination of the monthly time off granted to delegates to attend trade union meetings, authorization to hire teachers under fixed-term and part-time contracts, suspension of payment of remuneration for trade union leave, etc.).
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that the government of Ro Negro province deducts a percentage of wages corresponding to the union dues of UNTER members, but does not transfer it to the trade union's account, and that only part of the dues for the month of February  have been paid over.
.In its communication dated  April  the Government states that provincial Decrees Nos. / and / do not involve any violation of the constitutional right to strike or of the international Conventions on freedom of association. These regulations are a part of the legislative framework governing the right to strike in the provincial administration of Ro Negro which only lays down the following prior conciliation procedure: (a) a decision to take direct action must be adopted by the executives of recognized trade unions, in accordance with their by-laws; (b) the trade union shall send formal notification, with at least three days' notice, to the provincial Undersecretariat for Labour; and (c) within  hours of receiving such notification the above-mentioned Undersecretariat may decide to hold hearings to examine the reasons for taking the direct action. The Government adds that where the direct action was not formally decided by a legally recognized trade union in accordance with its by-laws or, where there is no such provision in its by-laws, with the approval of the provincial executive of the trade union, the legal consequence shall be that the direct action shall be declared illegal and applicable disciplinary sanctions under the regulations governing provincial public employees shall be adopted. This is a simple case of failure to provide services that is not protected by the right to strike and that entails the applicable sanctions, which shall not be applied in the case of direct action taken in accordance with the law. The Government states that it is clear from the above and from a close examination of the provincial Decrees at issue that the latter simply regulate the right to strike and cannot be deemed to restrict this right. The rights and guarantees laid down in the national Constitution must be exercised in accordance with the laws regulating the exercise thereof, which is what the above-mentioned provisions do.
.The Government states that Resolution No. / of the Provincial Education Council is intended to guarantee the constitutional right to education in the event of a teachers' strike for an unspecified period or prolonged duration and, contrary to the statement made by UNTER, does not involve any change in the conditions of recruitment of teachers, since persons holding posts in accordance with the regulations are not removed from their posts, but replaced while they take part in a strike until they resume their activity. The Government emphasizes that this measure cannot in any way be considered as an unfair practice under Act No. , since it is not clear of what the reprisal, change in working conditions or discriminatory treatment consists. Moreover, this resolution was not challenged at the appropriate time when it was submitted through the proper administrative and legal channels and, according to the government of the Ro Negro province, has not been applied to date.
.Concerning the allegation regarding the Ro Negro province's handling of teachers' collective agreements, the Government adds that ""denunciation"" is a form of termination of agreements. The Government states that there has been a change in the social and economic situation throughout the country, and in Ro Negro province in particular, since the collective agreement was approved, amounting to a change of circumstances which, in accordance with the doctrine, constitutes grounds for terminating an agreement. The Government points out that since the Provincial Education Council, a state agency which is a member of a collegiate body, is a party to the agreement, in order for it to sign the agreement the endorsement of the collegiate body is required, unless authority has expressly been delegated, which was not the case. This was the ruling handed down by the Second District Labour Court of Ro Negro province, the competent court in this case, which declared null and void the act performed by the president of the Provincial Education Council without the endorsement of the collegiate body. Lastly, the Government states that many provinces are now beset by major financial crises which have prevented them from regularly meeting their commitments under the obligations they have assumed, and that in this emergency context and in view of the impossibility of meeting all its financial commitments on time, Ro Negro province had established a payments schedule giving priority to public sector remuneration, including teachers' salaries, which are paid at regular intervals (monthly).
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant objects to a Resolution issued by the Education Council of Ro Negro province providing for the possibility of recruiting teachers to replace striking staff and to Decrees issued by the Executive of Ro Negro province governing the exercise of the right to strike of employees in the provincial public administration, decentralized bodies and autonomous bodies of the provincial Executive. The complainant alleges further that the employer - the Education Council of Ro Negro province - denounced or unilaterally terminated the collective agreements for teachers in the public sector and that the trade union dues deducted from the wages of members of the UNTER trade union by the government of Ro Negro province had not been paid to the trade union.
.Concerning Resolution No. / of the Education Council of Ro Negro province, challenged by the complainant, which authorizes the recruitment of teachers in the public sector to replace striking staff, the Committee notes that the Government states that (i) it is intended to guarantee the constitutional right to education in the event of a teachers' strike for an indefinite period or prolonged duration; (ii) it does not involve a change in the conditions of recruitment of teachers, since those holding posts in accordance with regulations are not removed, but are replaced while they take part in a strike until they resume their activity; (iii) this cannot be considered as an unfair practice under Act No.  respecting trade union associations; (iv) it was not challenged at the appropriate time when it was submitted through the proper administrative and legal channels; and (v) it had not been applied to date.
.In this respect, the Committee observes that the legal framework governing strikes in Argentina provides for the possibility of imposing a minimum service in the event of a strike in the education sector (Decree No. /, section ) which is in conformity with the principles of freedom of association. However, the Committee notes that Resolution No. / adds to this possibility of imposing a minimum service that of temporarily replacing strikers with other workers. In this respect, the Committee emphasizes that ""the hiring of workers to break a strike in a sector which cannot be regarded as an essential sector in the strict sense of the term, and hence one in which strikes might be forbidden, constitutes a serious violation of freedom of association"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee accordingly requests the Government to take the necessary steps to repeal Resolution No. / issued by the Education Council of Ro Negro province.
.As regards Decrees Nos. / and / issued by the Executive of Ro Negro province, the Committee observes that they essentially provide for a prior conciliation procedure and non-payment of salaries during a strike.
.The Committee observes that these provisions of the Decrees at issue do not violate the principles of freedom of association (see Digest, op. cit., paras. ,  and ). None the less, the Committee observes that in cases in which a strike in the public service was not decided in conformity with the provisions of the Decrees, it may be declared illegal by the Ministry of the Interior, Labour and Social Affairs, and that sanctions may be applied, such as termination of the employment relationship or suspension of registration of a trade union or of its legal personality. In",3,1996,Argentina
283,"this respect, the Committee recalls that it has already had occasion to examine a complaint against the Government of Argentina concerning the power of the Ministry of Labour to declare strikes illegal (see nd Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. ). The Committee accordingly reiterates its previous conclusions to the effect that ""the final decisions concerning the illegality of strikes should not be made by the Government, especially in those cases in which the Government is a party to the dispute"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to amend the Decrees in question so that it is not the Government itself which decides on the legality or illegality of a strike in the public service, but the judicial authorities or an independent body.
.As regards the allegation concerning the denunciation (and hence termination) of the collective agreements in force in the education sector of Ro Negro province, the Committee observes that these measures were taken unilaterally and by decision of the President of the Education Council of Ro Negro province (CEP), without being endorsed by the CEP, which was challenged by the judicial authority. The Committee notes that the Government justifies these measures stating that there has been a change in the social and economic reality throughout the country and in the Ro Negro province in particular since the collective agreements came into force (a change in circumstances as grounds for termination of the agreements). In this respect, the Committee recalls that ""the suspension or derogation by decree - without the agreement of the parties - of collective agreements freely entered into by the parties violates the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining established in Article  of Convention No. . If the Government wishes the clauses of a collective agreement to be brought into line with the economic policy of the country, it should attempt to persuade the parties to take account voluntarily of such considerations"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). The Committee observes that in this case the administrative authority did not act by decree, but simply notified the parties of the denunciation of the collective agreements in force, which has a comparable effect. In these circumstances, while it deplores the fact that the President of the CEP did not respect the agreements freely entered into by the parties and that there has been no attempt to persuade the complainant organization to take account of economic changes that have occurred, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the Education Council of Ro Negro province (CEP) respects the collective agreements that have been concluded and avails itself of legal procedures if it wishes to renegotia
.As regards the allegation concerning the failure to pay the UNTER trade union the dues deducted from the salaries of its affiliates since the month of February  by the government of Ro Negro province, the Committee regrets that the Government has not communicated its observations on this matter. In this respect, the Committee observes that national legislation (Act No. , section , subsection ) lays down an obligation to deduct trade union dues for trade union organizations with legal personality (the most representative organizations). In these circumstances, recalling that non-payment of trade union dues can result in serious financial difficulties for trade union organizations, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the government of Ro Negro province pay without delay to the UNTER trade union organization the union dues of its members which have been withheld since February  and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.Lastly, the Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to repeal Resolution No. /, issued by the Education Council of Ro Negro province, allowing workers to be hired during a teachers' strike.(b) Recalling that the final decision concerning the illegality of strikes should not be made by the Government, especially in those cases in which the Government is a party to the dispute, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to amend Decrees Nos. / and / issued by the Executive of Ro Negro province so that it is not the Government itself which decides on the legality or illegality of a strike in the public service, but the judicial authorities or an independent body.(c) As regards the allegation concerning the denunciation (and hence termination) of the collective agreements in force in the education sector of Ro Negro province by unilateral decision of the President of the Education Council of Ro Negro province (CEP), the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the CEP respect the collective agreements that have been concluded and avail itself of the legal procedures if it wishes to renegotiate such agreements.(d) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the government of Ro Negro province pay without delay to the UNTER trade union organization the union dues paid by its members which have been withheld since February  and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.(e) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case.",3,1996,Argentina
284,".The Committee examined this case during its May  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  October  and  May . At its meeting of March , the Committee deferred its examination of this case at the request of the Government.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ); and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that, in this case, the complainant organization is alleging restrictions on the right to collective bargaining in virtue of the Decrees passed in December  by the executive power: Decree No.  (which empowers the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to revoke, in part or in whole, the registration of a collective labour agreement), Decree No.  (which provides that should there be disagreement among the parties the Ministry of Labour and Social Security will determine the scope of collective bargaining) and Decree No.  (which provides for collective bargaining within the framework of small enterprises).
.The Committee notes that the Decrees in question were declared wholly or partly unconstitutional by legal tribunals of first and second instance, and subsequently went before the Supreme Court.
.In this respect the Committee notes the Government's indication that: () the Decrees were suspended from taking effect in virtue of judicial proceedings before the Supreme Court; () the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) requested the Supreme Court to suspend the proceedings for a period of  days so that there was a possibility of arriving at an out-of-court agreement; () up until now the Decrees have not had any formal practical application; and () currently representatives of workers, employers and national authorities are in the process of drawing up a draft agreement on collective bargaining.
.The Committee, in this context, proposes to examine the Decrees in question so that the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining may be taken into account in the process of the legislative changes which the Government is carrying out with the social partners.
.As regards Decree No. /, which empowers the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to revoke, in part or in whole, the registration of a collective labour agreement, the Committee notes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, on analysing the application of Convention No.  by Argentina, has for several years criticized the legal provisions relating to the registration of collective labour agreements, and has also already commented on the conformity of the Decree in question with Convention No.  (see observation of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, Report III, Part A of ). Therefore the Committee refers to the commentary of the Committee of Experts as follows:The Committee recalls that for many years it has criticized the legal provisions relating to the granting of official approval by the Ministry of Labour for the validity of collective agreements which go beyond enterprise level; for the purposes of official approval consideration must be given not only to whether a collective labour agreement contains clauses violating the public-order standards of Acts Nos.  and , and also whether it complies with the following criteria: productivity, investment and the introduction of technology and vocational training systems (section  of Act No. , section  of Act No.  and section  of Decree No. /).In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government states that the question relating to the approval to be granted by the labour authorities, together with the contents of the collective agreements analysed prior to the granting of approval, should be dealt with in a draft legislative reform. Similarly, the Committee notes that the Government states that the influence of the State, through the granting of approval, has been significantly reduced as a result of the increase in collective bargaining at enterprise level, and that Decree No. /, which links wage negotiation to an increase in productivity is virtually revoked by Decree No. / for a wide range of conventional activities.In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the draft reform on collective bargaining to which the Government refers will eliminate the provisions which place conditions on the official approval necessary from the administrative authorities for collective agreements going beyond enterprise level, and which are linked to criteria of productivity, investments and the introduction of technology and vocational training systems. The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the draft legislation with its next report.The Committee observes that in December  the Government issued Decree No. / which authorizes the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to revoke, in part or in whole, the official approval of a collective agreement if the provisions thereof conflict with the legal rules issued after approval has been granted and if once the agreed period has expired the Ministry considers that the validity of the agreement no longer meets the requirements of section  of Act No. . The Committee considers that this Decree confirms and expands the intervention of administrative authorities in collective bargaining, something which has already been criticized.
.As regards Decree No. /, which empowers the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to determine the scope of collective bargaining, the Committee notes also that the Committee of Experts has commented on the conformity of this Decree with the provisions of Convention No.  (see observation from the Committee of Experts, op. cit.). Therefore, the Committee refers to the commentary of the Committee of Experts as follows:Furthermore, the Committee observes that in December , Decree No. / was also issued and provides that in cases where parties do not reach agreement on the sectors to be covered by negotiations of a collective agreement, this shall be decided by the Ministry of Labour, which must not exceed the minimum scope proposed. In the Committee's opinion, this implies that between a proposal for negotiation at the level of industry or branch of activity and a proposal for negotiation at enterprise level, in the absence of an agreement between the parties, a decision is taken within the enterprise sector and is imposed by the administrative authority concerned. In this respect, the Committee emphasizes that in drawing up the Convention, the principle of voluntary collective bargaining and the level of negotiation should not be conditioned or imposed by legislation or by a decision of the administrative authority, but should depend essentially on the will of the parties concerned.
.As regards Decree No. /, which contains certain provisions regarding collective bargaining within the framework of small enterprises, the Committee notes that the National Chamber of Labour -- a judicial body at the appeal level -- declared sections  and  of the Decree in question unconstitutional. In this respect it should be highlighted that section  gives ""the internal committee, staff delegates or similar bodies"" the possibility of concluding collective agreements within the sphere of small enterprises. In this way, although it may be considered that a provision of this type does not in itself violate the principles of freedom of association, the Committee reminds the Government that the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ) and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), contain explicit provisions guaranteeing that, where there exist in the same undertaking both trade union representatives and elected representatives, appropriate measures are to be taken to ensure that the existence of elected representatives in an enterprise is not used to undermine the position of the trade unions concerned (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee would point out to the Government the importance it attaches to this principle.
.The Committee points out to the Government the above-mentioned principles and conclusions on Decrees Nos. /, / and / -- currently suspended -- in so far as they pose problems of conformity with Convention No. . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the decrees and any collective agreements adopted pursuant to the decrees. Likewise, the Committee expresses the firm hope that the draft agreement for collective bargaining which the Government has indicated it is preparing with the participation of the social partners and the recent draft law on labour law reform, as adopted, will fully conform with the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee would point out to the Government the principles formulated in the conclusions with respect to Decrees Nos. /, / and / in so far as they pose problems of conformity with Convention No. . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the decrees and the collective",-1,1996,Argentina
285,"agreements adopted pursuant to the decrees.(b) The Committee expresses the firm hope that the draft agreement on collective bargaining which the Government has indicated it is preparing with the participation of the social partners, and the recent draft law on labour law reform, as adopted, will fully conform with the principles of freedom of association.
.The complaints in this case are contained in a communication dated  June  from the Tram-drivers' Union (UTA), the Argentine Air Crew Association (AAA), the National Truckers' Federation (FNTOCTAC), the Union of Dredging and Marking Staff (SPEDB), the Argentine Union of Private Teachers (SADOP). the Argentine Federation of Pharmacy Workers (FATF), the Argentine Federation of Printing Workers (FATI), the Union of Employees of Courts of Law (UEJN), the Centre of Overseas Captains and Merchant Navy Officers (CCUOMM), the Argentine Union of Mill Workers (UOMA), the Association of Medical Advertising Agents of the Argentine Republic (AAPMRA), the Single Union of Workers in Advertising (SUP), the Centre of Naval Radio Communications Chiefs and Officers (CJONR), the Association of Underground Supervisory Staff (APSESBA), and the Argentine Television Union (SAT). The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) associated itself with the complaint in a communication dated  September . In January  the Tram-drivers' Union (UTA) sent a communication containing new allegations.
.The Government sent partial observations in communications dated  February and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the Tram-drivers' Union (UTA) and the other trade union organizations raise objections to Act No.  on insolvency and bankruptcy which renders collective agreements in force ineffective and makes it compulsory to renegotiate new collective agreements. Specifically, the complainants object to the following sections of Act No. :Section , paragraphs , ,  and Labour contracts: The opening of bankruptcy proceedings renders collective agreements in force ineffective for a period of three years, or until the completion of the bankruptcy proceedings, whichever is the shorter.During that period, labour relations shall be governed by individual contracts and by the Labour Contract Act.The bankrupt party and the recognized trade union association shall negotiate an emergency collective agreement for the duration of the bankruptcy proceedings, up to a maximum of three years.The conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings for any reason, or their interruption sine die, shall put an end to the emergency collective agreement that may have been negotiated, and the corresponding collective agreements shall once again be in force.Section , paragraph  (bankruptcy)Collective labour agreements covering staff employed in the bankrupt establishment or enterprise shall cease to have any legal effect vis--vis the new owner and shall be renegotiated by the parties concerned.
.The trade union organizations explain that in July  a Framework Agreement on Employment, Productivity and Social Equity was signed by the Government, the employers' sector and the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) representing the labour sector, which, inter alia, set out the terms of the current reform of the law on bankruptcy. The complainants state that their representation by the CGT was a formal arrangement and no more, inasmuch as the workers' movement making up this Confederation did not at any time authorize the signatories to subscribe to any such agreement.
.In its communication of January , the UTA raises objections to the following Executive Decrees: Decree No. / empowering the Ministry of Labour to revoke the registration of a collective labour agreement; Decree No. / empowering the Ministry of Labour to determine the scope of collective bargaining; and Decree No. / containing certain provisions regarding collective bargaining.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government points out that the impugned law (Act No. ) is an Act proclaimed by the National Congress in the exercise of its constitutional powers and is based on the Framework Agreement on Employment, Productivity and Social Equity, a tripartite agreement in which the employers' and workers' sectors (through their most representative bodies) agreed with the national Government, inter alia, to undertake a reform of the insolvency and bankruptcy procedures in force in the country and to revise the juridical framework of collective bargaining. The provisions of sections  and  of Act No. , which are impugned by the complainants, are the outcome of that agreement.
.The Government states that the reasons behind the said Act are that insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings are exceptional circumstances and that the labour legislation should therefore address them in terms that are sufficiently broad to enable the employer to fulfil his or her obligations, on the one hand, and to help the workers recover the amounts due to them, on the other. Insolvency proceedings should endeavour to facilitate the continued operation of the enterprise and to maintain the workers' jobs. Similarly, in the case of bankruptcy, a purchaser should be sought for the bankrupt establishment or enterprise, essentially to avoid the disappearance of a source of employment. This is particularly important in an economic crisis such as is currently being experienced both internationally and nationally, because of its impact on employment. From the juridical standpoint, both bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings imply a substantial change in the circumstances under which the bankrupt employer entered into his or her original commitments and in the circumstances that prevailed when the collective agreements were concluded and while they remained in force. All these factors justify the revision of the applicable collective agreement. It does not in any way violate international labour Conventions Nos. ,  and . Moreover, although section  of Act No.  temporarily suspends the collective agreements in force for the reasons indicated (suspension is for a maximum of three years or for the duration of the bankruptcy proceedings, whichever is the shorter), it provides for the bankrupt establishment or enterprise and the recognized trade union to negotiate an emergency collective agreement for the duration of the proceedings, up to a maximum of three years. These agreements are negotiated directly between the trade union and the bankrupt employer, without the involvement of the trade union movement or bankruptcy courts, and leaves the parties considerable discretion. Finally, the Governe impugned sections of the Act are designed to protect the worker by facilitating the continued operation of the enterprise and the maintenance of the workers' jobs and, in the worst of cases, to enable to workers to recover the amounts due to them.
.In its communication of  May , the Government notes that the application of Decrees Nos. ,  and  has been suspended since they were the subject of a case before the Supreme Court. The Government states that it will be forwarding its observations on this matter shortly.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainants raise objections to certain provisions of Act No.  on insolvency and bankruptcy which suspend the collective agreements in force and require the negotiation of new collective agreements. The Committee further notes that the Tram-drivers' Union (UTA) raises objections to Executive Decrees Nos. /, / and /, on the grounds that they restrict the right to collective bargaining.
.With regard to the impugned sections of Act No.  on insolvency and bankruptcy, the Committee notes that the Government states in its reply that (i) the employers' and workers' sectors (through their most representative organizations) agreed with the Government to undertake a reform of the insolvency and bankruptcy procedure and that sections  and  of the said Act were drawn up in line with that agreement; (ii) the reasons behind the Act are that insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings are exceptional circumstances and that labour legislation should therefore address them in terms that are sufficiently broad to enable the employer to fulfil his or her obligations, on the one hand, and to help the workers recover the amounts due to them, on the other; (iii) from the juridical standpoint, both bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings imply a substantial change in the circumstances under which the bankrupt employer entered into his or her original commitments and in the circumstances that prevailed when the collective agreements were concluded; and (iv) although section  of the Act temporarily suspends the collective agreements (for a maximum of three years or for the duration of the proceedings, whichever is the shorter) the Act does provide for the possibility of negotiating an emergency collective agreement, without the involvement of the judicial authorities, and leaves the parties considerable discretion.
.The Committee notes that the Act concerned does indeed provide that (i) in the event of insolvency proceedings (when an enterprise's liabilities are greater than its assets and the employer proposes an agreement with his or her creditors in order to pay his or her debts), a collective agreement for cases of crisis can be negotiated, the previous collective agreements being therefore repealed for three years - or less if the proceedings are completed before; and (ii) in the case of bankruptcy the collective agreements cease to be in force and may be renegotiated by",0,1996,Argentina
286,"the parties concerned.
.The Committee has always considered that collective agreements entered into freely by the parties must be respected and their renegotiation must not be imposed by law. In the present case, however, which refers to insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings, insisting on full compliance with the provisions of the collective agreement might threaten the continued operation of the enterprise and the maintenance of the workers' jobs. Moreover, the Committee notes that, according to the complainants and the Government, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) - of which the complainants are members and which is the most representative trade union - did reach an agreement on the impugned provisions of the Act on insolvency and bankruptcy, although the complainants claim that the CGT did not have a mandate to accept any restrictions. Moreover, the Committee notes that the trade unions concerned can renegotiate the collective agreements which were repealed in a crisis situation. Consequently, the Committee considers that the Act does not violate Convention No. .
.As to the alleged restriction of the right to collective bargaining under Decrees Nos. /, / and /, the Committee observes that the Government has stated that it will forward its observations on this matter shortly and that the Decrees are suspended and are the subject of proceedings before the Supreme Court. Finally, the Committee requests the complainants to submit additional information regarding these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:- With regard to the alleged restriction of the right to collective bargaining under Executive Decrees Nos. /, / and /, the Committee expresses the hope that the Government, as it has indicated, will forward its observations shortly. Finally, the Committee requests the complainants to submit additional information regarding these allegations.",-1,1996,Argentina
287,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (UTI) of February . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of February , the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (UTI) explained that it was set up in  by the workers of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (PAMI) (according to the complainant, a non-state entity governed by public law), and that it has been requesting recognition for purposes of, inter alia, collective bargaining, since  with no success. The complainant describes in detail the administrative and judicial formalities it has completed since . In particular it states that in  the Ministry refused UTI's request for recognition, pointing to the existence of two other trade unions that were recognized in UTI's sphere of activity. Nevertheless, in February  the judicial authorities expressed the opinion that ""the legal nature of the PAMI Institute is an obstacle to its workers being represented by the trade union organizations mentioned in the resolution of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (UPCN and ATE)"". The complainant declares that subsequently, in November , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security stipulated that UTI should be granted recognition, and that in November  the judicial authorities indicated that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security should hand down a decision on its request for recognition. In addition, the complainant states that in May  the Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security observed that of a total of , workers at the Institute, , were members of the complainant, , of UPCN and  of ATE, and that in November  the Legal Technical Department of the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations ruled that UTI should be granted recognition. The complainant points out that the Ministry of Labour has not yet prepared a resolution in this connection and that as UTI still has not been recognized, the workers of the PAMI Institute have no collective agreement and no social security provisions of their own. (The complainant annexes copies of the administrative and judicial resolutions to its complaint.)
.In its communication dated  May , the Government annexes a resolution of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security dated  May  concerning the allegations presented by the complainant relating to the refusal to grant recognition to the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (UTI) for the purposes of, inter alia, collective bargaining. The resolution in question provides in particular the following:... that the petitioner, the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (UTI) has been registered as a trade union association since  September  and groups together civil servants who belong to the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers. It is therefore an enterprise trade union.That, according to the Report of the Department responsible for the registration of trade union entities, the State Workers' Association (ATE) does not represent the staff of the Institute in question.That, as regards the Union of State Employees of the Nation (UPCN), this entity has been granted recognition (No. ) by virtue of Resolution ST and P No. /.That, by virtue of Resolution MT and SS No.  of  September , the text of article  of the statutes which sets out the geographical area and the persons falling within the scope of this union, has been approved.That, subsequently, Resolution MT and SS No.  dated  December  approved the text of the new statutes and affirmed that ""the Union will continue to be recognized for the same geographical area and persons covered ...""That this union comprises any other body and centralized or decentralized public entity whether it is a state entity or not at the national, provincial and/or municipal levels. The granting of recognition to this organization covers the staff of the Institute in question.That, in analysing the characteristics of the trade union entities in question, and in order to decide on the request to grant recognition for purposes of, inter alia, collective bargaining to the enterprise trade union, it would be appropriate to take into consideration section  of Act No.  which stipulates that: ""A trade union at the enterprise level may be granted recognition only when another base-level trade union and/or a union does not already operate within the geographical area or the area of activity or category covered.""That, in analysing the annexed documentation, the reasons given in the file and the specific characteristics of the employer, it follows that the Union of State Employees of the Nation (UPCN) covers, as regards geographical area and persons covered by its recognition, the workers of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers. Consequently, and very clearly, it would not be appropriate to accede to the request for recognition presented by the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (UTI) given that it is a general provision of the Act and not an arbitrary decision by the authorities which prevents the recognition of this entity. Consequently, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security rejects the request for recognition presented by the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (UTI)
.The Committee observes that the allegations relate to the fact that the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (UTI) has been refused the recognition it has been requesting since  (only trade union organizations which are recognized have, inter alia, the right to collective bargaining and to the administration of social security benefits, i.e. the administration of medical insurance and other social benefits for workers).
.The Committee observers that the resolution of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security dated  May  states that () the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (UTI) - the complainant - groups together civil servants who belong to the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers and that it is therefore a trade union at the enterprise level; () in , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security approved the text of the new statutes of the Union of State Employees of the Nation (UPCN) which has been granted recognition for purposes of, inter alia, collective bargaining. These statutes, which set out the geographical area and the persons falling within the scope of this union, provide in particular that this union encompasses workers ""of any other body and centralized or decentralized public entity whether it is a state entity or not at the national, provincial and/or municipal levels ...""; () section  of the Act on trade union associations stipulates that ""a trade union at the enterprise level may be granted recognition only when another base-level trade union and/or a union does not already operate within the geographical area or the area of activity or category covered""; and () the UPCN includes, as regards geographical area and persons covered by its recognition, the staff of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers, reason for which recognition was not granted to UTI.
.The Committee notes that the documentation annexed to the complaint shows that (i) in  the Ministry of Labour and Social Security indicated that recognition should be granted to UTI; (ii) in November  the judicial authorities stipulated that the national Ministry of Labour should hand down a decision on the application for recognition; (iii) in May  the Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security observed that of the Institute's , workers, , were members of UTI (almost  per cent of the total), , of UPC and  of ATE; and (iv) the Legal Technical Department of the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations stated that recognition should be granted to the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers.
.This being the case, and taking into account all the administrative resolutions and judicial rulings pertaining to the granting of recognition to the complainant as well as the fact that this organization is clearly the most representative one, which is not refuted by the Government, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to grant recognition immediately to the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (UTI), enabling it to negotiate collectively and exercise the other rights enjoyed by the most representative organizations. In this respect, observing that up to now recognition has",0,1996,Argentina
288,"been refused by virtue of section  of Act No.  on trade union associations, the Committee must draw the Government's attention to the fact that, to the extent that this provision prevents the most representative trade union organizations in an enterprise from bargaining at the enterprise level, it is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. Consequently, the Committee further requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that this provision of Act No.  is amended. The Committee draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.Lastly, the Committee deplores the excessive length of time - more than  years - allowed to elapse before deciding whether or not to grant recognition to a trade union organization. Furthermore, it observes with concern that this is not the first time that it is examining complaints against the Government of Argentina in which there are allegations of excessive delays and red tape in the processing of the registration of a trade union organization or the granting of recognition (see th Report, Cases Nos. , ,  and , para. ; th Report, Case No. , para. ; and th Report, Case No. , para. ). Given this situation, the Committee urges the Government to take measures to ensure that in future, when requests are made for the registration of an organization or the granting of recognition, the competent administrative authorities decide on the matter without unjustified delay.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee urges the Government to take measures to ensure that recognition is granted immediately to the Workers' Union of the National Institute of Social Services for Pensioners and Retired Workers (UTI).(b) The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future, when an organization requests registration or the granting of recognition, the competent administrative authorities return their decisions without unjustified delay.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that section  of the Act on trade union associations is amended. It draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",-1,1996,Argentina
289,".The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting (see th Report, paras.  to ) and requested the Government to take the necessary steps for the reinstatement of the trade union official, Mr. Rojo, in his previous post, and if this is not possible because of the time which has elapsed, to ensure that he is fully compensated.
.In a communication of  October , the Government stated that it has undertaken the required formalities by notifying the Province of Salta of the recommendation formulated by the Committee. . In a communication of October , the State Workers' Association (ATE) notes that having learned of the Committee's recommendation, Mr. Miguel Hugo Rojo presented a photocopy to the Administrative Court of First Instance of the city of Salta, in the Province of Salta, of the Republic of Argentina. In this administrative action which is actually at the evidentiary stage, the Province of Salta, through its legal representative, denied or refused to recognize the existence of the Committee's recommendations, and asked to have the document removed from the file. According to the complainant, this indicates that the Province of Salta refuses to recognize the recommendations of the Committee, the proof being that to date, Miguel Hugo Rojo has not been reinstated in his post, nor has he been paid the salary owing.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee deeply regrets that Mr. Rojo has not yet been reinstated in his former post nor has he been compensated fully. Under the circumstances, the Committee reiterates its former recommendation and again requests the Government to take the necessary steps immediately to implement the recommendation adopted in June .
.The Committee examined this case for the last time at its meeting of March  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )). Subsequently, the State Workers' Association (ATE) sent additional information in a communication dated  July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the complainant has alleged in this case the transfer of the trade union official Mr. Rojo due to anti-union reasons and his subsequent dismissal.
.First of all the Committee observes that the Government states that it is not appropriate in this case to refer to the application of Conventions Nos. ,  and , since Mr. Rojo worked in the central administration of the Province of Salta and that, as regards Convention No. , both the legislation of the Province of Salta and the national legislation provide the necessary protection against possible acts of anti-union discrimination in the public administration. In this respect, the Committee emphasizes that, as the Government itself has indicated, Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, grants protection against acts of anti-union discrimination which can be committed at the level of the national public administration as well as at the provincial level. Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government does not indicate whether Act No.  respecting trade union associations (which provides protection against the dismissal of trade union officials) is applicable in the provincial public administration, and points out in any event that the public administration is governed by a provincial ""system of public official stability"".
.In this respect, the Committee notes that it has already ruled on this aspect in its previous examination of the case and it refers in this connection to the conclusions made on that occasion, which state as follows: ""The Committee considers that it is not its role to determine in federal States which are the internal standards regulating protection against anti-union discrimination and, in particular, whether the standards of general application or those of the province in question should be applicable. The Committee nevertheless recalls that irrespective of the procedural or substantive laws applying to public officials or employees in provinces of the federal State, it is bound to examine whether the actual alleged anti-union discrimination measures are or not in accordance with the provision of ratified ILO Conventions and the principles of freedom of association"" (see th Report, paras.  and ).
.As regards specifically the transfer and subsequent dismissal of Mr. Rojo, the Committee notes that the complainant repeats that these acts were committed as a reprisal to the protection of the workers' interests by the trade union association and the official in question, and that there is no doubt that the dispute and the measures taken against Mr. Rojo were directly related since the latter immediately followed the trade union dispute. The Committee notes that the Government also repeats that the reasons for which the suspension and dismissal of Mr. Rojo were ordered were not due to membership in a trade union organization or participation in the normal activities of such an organization, but to specific matters of discipline, which according to the Government have not been refuted in the procedures taken to date. Furthermore, in the view of the Government, Mr. Rojo did not make use of the appropriate legal means for dealing with his case.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that, even after the previous examination of the case, the versions of the complainant and the Government continue to be contradictory concerning the anti-union motivation of the transfer and subsequent dismissal of Mr. Rojo. The Committee also notes that it appears from the documentation and the judicial rulings sent by the complainant that: () the Administrative Court of First Instance of the Province of Salta stated that ""Act  has established a protective legal procedure with regard to anti-trade union conduct"" (section  of this Act stipulates that ""workers protected by the guarantees for which provision is made in sections ,  and  of this Act may not be dismissed or suspended and their conditions of work may not be changed without prior judicial resolution excluding them from the guarantee ..."") and thus ordered the reinstatement of Mr. Rojo in his workplace; and () the Court of Justice of the Province of Salta overturned the ruling of the Court of First Instance on the grounds that Act No.  is not applicable to public employees of the province but ""without prejudice to the possible administrative and judicial revision of the legitimacy of the administrative acts (transfer, suspension and dismissal of the trade union official) in question by means of the appropriate appeals"". The Committee notes that in this way the Court of Justice of the Province of Salta did not rule on whether or not there had been anti-trade union discrimination and indirectly referred the dispute between the parties, which dates from , back to the administrative level and in this case to the administrative courts.
.Bearing in mind all these elements, the Committee concludes that: (i) the collective dispute between the parties and the transfer of Mr. Rojo occurred at approximately the same time (the dispute began at the end of February  and his transfer was ordered on  March); and (ii) although the administrative resolution dismissing Mr. Rojo refers to ""slander"" by the official against his hierarchical superior (""lacked the necessary moral fibre""), this occurred within a context of accusations about financial irregularities and corruption in the institution made by the complainant, which resulted in the legal proceedings against Mr. Rojo's superiors, which does not exclude the possibility that the measures against this official constitute a form of reprisal.
.The Committee recalls in this respect that it may often be difficult, if not impossible, for a worker to furnish proof of an act of anti-union discrimination of which he or she has been the victim (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). In any event, the Committee believes that in this case account should be taken of: () the important trade union post held by Mr. Rojo at the time when the dispute began (Secretary General of the Provincial Executive Council of the State Workers' Association of the Province of Salta); () the importance of this case for the Province of Salta (the Chamber of Deputies of the Province declared in September  ""its total disagreement with the procedure adopted by the Executive Branch of the Province, which by means of Decree No.  ordered the dismissal of Mr. Rojo, and that it would like to see the provincial Executive Branch take the necessary steps with a view to reconsidering the measure adopted""; () the fact that the judicial appeal authorities have not ruled on the substance of this case (the existence or non-existence of anti-union discrimination) but merely examined whether Act No.  (and in particular the provisions respecting trade union protection) was applicable to the trade union official of the Province of Salta, Mr. Rojo; () the absence to",-1,1995,Argentina
290,"date of any definitive judicial ruling on whether the said (federal) Act and in particular the trade union protection which it regulates are applicable in the Province of Salta, so that the measures taken against Mr. Rojo (transfer and subsequent dismissal) are part of a context of legal uncertainty concerning its validity; and () the extremely long period of time which has elapsed (seven years) since the measures were taken against Mr. Rojo, without any final ruling having been made by the judicial authority. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that serious and concordant elements of presumption exist which lead it to believe that Mr. Rojo has been a victim of anti-union discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps for the reinstatement of the trade union official, Mr. Rojo, in his previous post and, if this is not possible because of the time which has elapsed, to ensure that he is fully compensated.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps for the reinstatement of the trade union official, Mr. Rojo, in his previous post and, if this is not possible because of the time which has elapsed, to ensure that he is fully compensated.
.The State Workers' Association (ATE) submitted a complaint against the Government of Argentina for infringement of trade union rights in a communication in December . The ATE sent additional information in a communication dated  April .
.The Government sent its comments in a communication dated  February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of December  and  April , the State Workers' Association (ATE) alleges that Miguel Hugo Rojo (Secretary General of the provincial Executive Council of the ATE) suffered reprisals for his trade union action during a collective dispute at the General Incomes Board of the Province of Salta in . These consisted of: () a change in his workplace (he was transferred from being Inspector of the External Finance Department to the Department of Internal Auditing); and () suspension from his post without pay for  days (for having refused to change his workplace), as a result of a summary indictment. Both measures hindered the freedom of movement of the person concerned, thus preventing the exercise of his rights with respect to freedom of association. Moreover, Miguel Hugo Rojo has not received his wages since then because he has still not taken up his post.
.As a result of these measures, Miguel Hugo Rojo lodged successive appeals which went as far as the Supreme Court, which decided that as he was a provincial official, he would have to exhaust all the administrative procedures and submit his case to the Administrative Court. The first judgement handed down by the courts, however, had ordered the reinstatement of the person concerned in his job.
.The complainant organization feels that the constitutional and legal provisions pertaining to protection against anti-union discrimination were incorrectly interpreted and applied (in particular, section  of Act No. , concerning occupational associations - considered not applicable to the public employees of the federal State of Salta by the judicial authorities - which provides for swift judicial proceedings in the event of an obstruction to the free exercise of trade union rights.
.In its communication of  February , the Government stated that the order which suspended Mr. Hugo Rojo (Decree No. /) was not brought into question in the appeal which he lodged as it was an administrative order which benefits from the presumption of legitimacy. According to national jurisprudence, as a consequence of this presumption, judges are prohibited from issuing decrees ex officio invalidating such administrative orders and their illegitimacy must be proven. In this case, the State does not need judicial authorization for the suspension of functions to the extent that Decree No. / has not been called into question. Moreover, at no point in time was it raised in the allegations that Mr. Hugo Rojo was separated from his post due to his trade union membership or participation in trade union activities.
.As regards the allegation that legal standards were incorrectly applied or interpreted by the judicial authority, to the effect that section  of Act No.  concerning occupational associations (which provides for a speedy judicial proceeding in the event of obstruction of freedom of association) is not applicable to public officials in the Province of Salta and that, under the provincial legislation of Salta, employees must exhaust all administrative procedures before lodging an appeal with the Administrative Court, the Committee notes that the position of the complainant and the Government are contradictory. The Committee considers that it is not its role to determine in federal States which are the internal standards regulating protection against anti-union discrimination and, in particular, whether the standards of general application or those of the province in question should be applicable.
.The Committee nevertheless recalls that irrespective of the procedural or substantive laws applying to public officials or employees in provinces of a federal State, it is bound to examine whether the actual alleged anti-union discrimination measures are or not in accordance with the provisions of ratified ILO Conventions and the principles of freedom of association.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization, the decision to transfer the trade union official Miguel Hugo Rojo from one workplace to another and the subsequent measures taken against him were on account of his trade union action in a collective dispute which began at the beginning of February . According to the documentation presented by the complainant, strikes took place and accusations were made of financial irregularities and corruption - such as an administrative resolution which changed the rules pertaining to the ""incentive fund"" for workers. The Committee also notes that the Government denies that the measures taken against Miguel Hugo Rojo had anti-union motives. The Committee nevertheless notes that the administrative resolutions containing the grounds for the transfer of Miguel Hugo Rojo and the penalties against him, which have been communicated by the complainant organization, indicate the following:- for reasons of service and with a view to consolidating its skilled staff, the internal auditing department temporarily transferred the employee Mr. Rojo - tax inspector - to another department;- the person concerned refused to comply with this order, despite the fact that it was repeated; he then put in writing that the person who had decided the transfer ""lacked the necessary moral fibre to conduct the organization and was totally unable to function"", which caused ""moral damages to his hierarchical superior, undermining his honour and reputation"" (""slander"");- after having ""failed to fulfil his duties"" and ""being disrespectful and insulting to his superiors"", which made him ""subject to disciplinary measures"", he was suspended;- ""the failure to carry out services individually and on a regular basis constitutes a form of misconduct subject to a penalty, particularly in view of the fact that the accused clocked in and out of work with a card and failed to carry out the services he was supposed to do, which implies fraudulent behaviour and a violation of article No. (a) of the Statutes; this is tantamount to a desertion of duties which gives rise to the suspension of an official (article (c)) under these Statutes"";- ""another charge against the accused is the failure to comply with the requirement under article (k) of the Statutes, in other words to maintain a respectful attitude; indeed, on one occasion he displayed physical violence and, on others, made verbal threats"".
.The Committee notes that the versions given by the complainant and the administrative authority concerning the transfer of and the penalties imposed on the trade union official Miguel Hugo Rojo are contradictory.
.In the numerous cases involving allegations of anti-union discrimination that it has examined, the Committee has consistently stressed that no person shall be prejudiced in employment by reason of his or her trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th (revised) edition, , para. ). This protection should cover not only hiring and dismissal, but also any discriminatory measures during employment, in particular transfers (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). In addition, the remedy of reinstatement should be available to those who were victims of anti-union discrimination (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.In the case at hand, the Committee considers that the available information is insufficient to permit a determination of whether anti-union motives underlay the transfer of Mr. Miguel Hugo Rojo. Under these circumstances, in order to arrive at its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the complainant and the Government to provide supplementary information, in particular regarding the administrative acts and decisions, as well as the judgements that have been rendered on this subject.
.In the light",2,1995,Argentina
291,"of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation: In order to arrive at its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts, especially concerning whether the transfer of Miguel Hugo Rojo was for anti-union reasons and concerning his non-reinstatement, the Committee requests the complainant and the Government to provide supplementary information, in particular regarding the administrative decisions and judgements that have been rendered on this subject.",2,1995,Argentina
292,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting in June  (see th Report, paras. -) and requested the Government to keep it informed of the developments in the legal proceedings brought in connection with the acts of violence that occurred during the demonstrations and strikes organized in the provinces of Tierra del Fuego, Corrientes and San Juan, especially as they relate to the death of the worker Vctor Choque, the injuries sustained by unionists Juan Roberto Vera and Alejandro Vsquez and the assault and denial of freedom of which Eloy Camus and Juan Gonzlez were victim. The Committee also requested the Government to keep it informed of the legal proceedings brought by the police against the trade union leader Juan Gonzlez.
.In a communication dated  January , the Government stated that: (i) the legal proceedings relating to the provisional detention of Juan Gonzlez in the province of Corrientes are currently in the inquiry stage; (ii) in the affair of the homicide of Vctor Choque, a police officer was sentenced as the person responsible for his death to nine years in prison, but this verdict is being appealed and; (iii) it was not possible to obtain information on the subject of the legal proceedings relating to the abduction of Eloy Camus in the province of San Juan. The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of these legal proceedings.
.The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the judicial inquiry under way concerning the injuries sustained by Juan Roberto Vera and Alejandro Vsquez, as well as the legal proceedings brought by the police against the trade union leader Juan Gonzlez.
.The complaints in this case are contained in a communication from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) dated  May , a joint communication from the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) and Association of State Workers (ATE) dated June  and a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) dated  July . The CLAT sent additional information in a communication dated  August  and the CTA and ATE in a joint communication dated  October . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  November and  December  and  February and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.After referring to the gradual decline of employment opportunities in the province of Tierra del Fuego (in , a quarter of metalworkers in the province lost their jobs), the complainants allege that in  most of the enterprises in the cities of Ushuaia and Ro Grande dismissed workers or threatened to close down and that the television manufacturers Continental Fueguina dismissed most of their staff in March, a decision against which the staff protested. In February , the manual workers and employees of the province of Tierra del Fuego organized a demonstration during which highway No.  was blocked. They did this so that the governor would grant them an interview and thus permit them to explain the employment problems they were facing; the governor did not however agree to receive them.
.The complainants add that on  April , the workers of Continental Fueguina (in the city of Ushuaia), who had been occupying the enterprise's premises to protest against the dismissal of  workers without their being paid the compensation due to them, were violently ousted by the police. The State Employees' Trade Union Front, the local trade union sections and the Metalworkers' Union (UOM), backed at the national level by the Argentine Workers' Movement (MTA) and by the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA), decided to hold a general strike on  April . The outcome of the demonstrations that took place was one death (Mr. Victor Choque) on  April  and dozens of injuries. Among those injured were Mr. Juan Roberto Vera and Mr. Alejandro Vsques, members of the Association of State Workers (ATE/CLAT), who sustained numerous impacts of rubber bullets and various bruises from the blows they received. The person who died from a bullet in the head is a  year-old construction worker. According to the complainants, eye witnesses and film coverage show clearly the violent tactics of the authorities, who fired repeatedly on the workers, sometimes at a distance of  metre. The police were firing systematically from the street, but also from a vehicle dubbed the ""wild bus"" by the demonstrators (and from which they were firing at everything that moved in several of the nearby streets). The complainants sent a report on these events by the Legislative Investigation Committee of Argentina, as well as a video of these events.
.The complainants further allege that, in the province of San Juan, the state workers organized a hunger strike to protest against the adjustment policies pursued by the authorities in the province. When the strike had been going on for more than  hours, Mr. Eloy Camus, Secretary-General of the ATE, decided to go to his home to fetch blankets for his comrades. On the way he was intercepted by four people in a vehicle. He was beaten, dragged into a vehicle and held for several hours, during which he was tortured and burned with cigarettes on several parts of his body. After being shot in the leg, he was dragged to about  metres from the place where the hunger strike was going on. The perpetrators of these acts of violence have not so far been identified, in spite of the complaint lodged by the union leader who was attacked.
.The complainants also state that, in the province of Corrientes on  April , on the basis of a number of decrees, the Social Welfare Institute of the province laid off  workers. As a result, the staff called an indefinite strike at their place of work. On  April, in solidarity with the dismissed workers, a demonstration of state workers was held in front of the Institute, where the demonstrators were violently attacked by the police. Mr. Juan Gonzlez, Secretary of ATE/CLAT Corrientes, was beaten and kicked. He was arrested along with other union leaders and taken arbitrarily to Commissariat No.  where he was held incommunicado for five hours. He was charged with ""assault, obstruction and causing injury to the authority"".
.The complainants conclude with the general observation that it is alarming that, as a result of demonstrations and other legitimate forms of trade union action, trade unionists should be charged with various ""crimes"" as a form of intimidation. This weakens the possibility for trade union organizations to express their disagreement with the adjustment policies.
.In its communications dated  November and  December  and  February and  May , the Government states that, from the replies it has received from the three provincial governments implicated in the allegations, it would seem that in every case the events denounced were linked to common law offences that are being investigated in the various jurisdictions. In fact, the Government indicates that it now has sufficient proof to reaffirm its position that this was not a situation in which there was a violation of Convention No.  concerning freedom of association, nor was it a question of an off-hand remark during the police action which degenerated into indiscriminate repression, but rather a question of regrettable events at a precise point in time arising out of very special circumstances which are being investigated by the judiciary.
.Regarding the death of Mr. Victor Choque, the Government states that the examining magistrate in the province of Tierra del Fuego has ordered that the officer of the principal police, presumed perpetrator of the crime of homicide, i.e. the person presumed to have shot Mr. Choque dead, be brought to trial. According to the report of the provincial governor, however, the event under investigation occurred in the course of what the law defines as criminal acts (illegal seizure of property, damage, contempt, injury, etc.) and in no way constitutes a violation of ILO Convention No. ; the investigation merely concerns a matter of penal law. Based on the evidence in the file, the death of Victor Choque occurred on  April  when a group began to throw stones - some said it was raining stones - at the police station where a group of persons were being held by judicial decree, and not by police order, since  April . The Government expresses its surprise at the inaccuracies and omissions presented by the complainants in their submission. Overall, they have omitted to present the context in which the events occurred. The Government expresses its deep concern to see such delicate issues broached in such a partial and inaccurate manner.
.Regarding the events in the province of Corrientes, the governor has reported that the provincial court (Investigating Court No.  of the First Constituency) is investigating two complaints, one by Mr. Juan Alfredo Gonzlez",1,1995,Argentina
293,"alleging illegal denial of freedom, abuse of authority and damages (the trial is under way), and the other lodged by the provincial police against Mr. Juan Alfredo Gonzlez and other persons alleging assault, resistance to authority and causing injuries. The police stated that the Social Security Institute was roped off on  April  so that the disturbance due to the loudspeakers and demonstrators would not disrupt the regular activity. Thereafter, Mr. Vera (Chief of Operations) who was there requested Mr. Gonzlez and Mr. Gustidiano to stop using the loudspeakers which provoked hostility and shoving. The investigation shows that Gonzlez and Gustidiano, in their declarations, deny the facts and affirm that they were attacked. The Government has attached the legal medical report in which it was noted that Gustidiano only referred to some pain but that there were no external signs of assault while Gonzlez refused to be examined. In summary, the declarations are contradictory within a context which does not appear to have been one of a hostile climate of persecution, unless this is how one wishes to interpret the police request to stop using the loudspeakers. Both cases are under investigation and, as in the previous instance, it would appear that they involve common law offences that have nothing to do with freedom of association.
.Regarding the alleged kidnapping of Mr. Camus in the province of San Juan, the provincial government has reported that, as soon as the complaint was received by the provincial police, an investigation was initiated which has now been taken up by the visiting criminal magistrate, even though he has only Mr. Camus' own statements to go by and there is some doubt as to whether what occurred was motivated by the latter's private affairs or by internal trade union problems. This case is the object of a secret procedure. According to the findings in this third case, there is at present no evidence to suggest that the events being investigated could in any way constitute a violation of freedom of association.
.Finally, the Government states that all democratic institutions are fully operational in Argentina, that the three powers of the Republican State function freely and that, in the same way, trade unions are very active and exercise their rights - including the right to strike - normally and regularly. Consequently, the events denounced by the complainants can only be looked upon as isolated incidents that are a matter of common law and not of international labour legislation or freedom of association.
.The Government states that it will continue to send information on the progress of the court cases.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations allege the violent repression by the authorities of demonstrations or strikes, together with acts of aggression against union leaders and members in Continental Fueguina (province of Tierra del Fuego), where the worker Mr. Victor Choque died, and in the Social Welfare Institute (province of Corrientes), as well as the kidnapping for four hours, assault and torture of Mr. Eloy Camus, Secretary-General of the Association of State Workers, by four unknown persons during a hunger strike in the province of San Juan, and the detention for five hours and assault of Mr. Juan Gonzlez, Secretary of the Association of State Workers, in the province of Corrientes.
.The Committee notes the Government's observations to the effect that: () in every case, the events denounced involve common law offences that are being investigated by the judicial authority and do not concern violations of Convention No. ; () the person presumed responsible for the shot that caused the death of the worker Mr. Victor Choque is being brought to trial; () this event took place in the context of what are described as common law offences (causing of injury, damage, contempt, etc.) and the death in question occurred when a group of persons threw stones at the police station where other persons were being detained by judicial order; () the police in the province of Corrientes have lodged a complaint with the judicial authority against the trade unionist Mr. Juan Alfredo Gonzlez for alleged assault, resistance to the authority and causing injury (this unionist and others presented in turn a complaint which is pending); () as to the kidnapping of trade unionist Mr. Eloy Camus, there is some doubt as to whether what took place was motivated by his private affairs or internal trade union problems (the trial is the object of a secret procedure).
.The Committee deeply regrets the death of the worker Mr. Victor Choque and the acts of violence that occurred during the demonstrations and strikes in the provinces of Tierra del Fuego and Corrientes. Although the Government claims that the trade union action involved what are described as common law offences by trade unionists (specifically Mr. Juan Alberto Gonzlez, against whom penal charges have been brought), the Committee must point out that the Government does not deny the allegations that the police fired repeatedly at workers in the province of Tierra del Fuego and there are differing versions of the alleged aggression against workers demonstrating in the province of Corrientes. In these circumstances, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that ""the authorities should resort to the use of force only in situations where law and order is seriously threatened. The intervention of the forces of law and order should be in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence when controlling demonstrations which might result in a disturbance of the peace."" (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. .) The Committee calls on the Government to instruct the police authorities in future to guarantee the exercise of the right of trade unions to demonstrate without being the object of disproportionate measures or excessive violence. The Committee further requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the legal proceedings being brought in connection with the acts of violence that occurred during demonstrations and strikes in the provinces of Tierra del Fuego, Corrientes and San Juan, especially as they relate to the death of the worker Mr. Victor Choque, the injuries sustained by trade unionists Mr. Juan Roberto Vera and Mr. Alejandro Vsques, and the assault on and denial of freedom of union leaders Mr. Eloy Camus and Mr. Juan Gonzlez. While noting the Government's explanations, the Committee cannot but express its serious concern that at least three trade unionists were victims of acts of violence. It emphasizes that the protection of trade union rights requires that inquiries be held to determine responsibilities and that guilty parties be punished. The Committee requests the Government also to inform it of the outcome of the charges brought by the police before the judicial authority against the last-mentioned trade union leader.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deeply regretting the death of the worker Mr. Victor Choque and the acts of violence that occurred during the demonstrations and strikes in the provinces of Tierra del Fuego and Corrientes, the Committee calls on the Government to instruct the police authorities in future to guarantee the exercise of the right of trade unions to demonstrate without being the object of disproportionate measures or excessive violence.(b) The Committee further requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the legal proceedings being brought in connection with the acts of violence that occurred during demonstrations and strikes in the provinces of Tierra del Fuego, Corrientes and San Juan, especially as they relate to the death of the worker Mr. Victor Choque, the injuries sustained by trade unionists Mr. Juan Roberto Vera and Mr. Alejandro Vsques, and the assault on and denial of freedom of trade union leaders Mr. Eloy Camus and Mr. Juan Gonzlez. The Committee emphasizes that the protection of trade union rights requires that inquiries be held, responsibilities determined and that guilty parties be punished.(c) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the charges brought by the police before the judicial authority against trade union leader Mr. Juan Gonzlez.",1,1995,Argentina
294,".In this case, the Association of State Workers (ATE) first requested the intervention of the Director-General of the ILO in a communication dated  August  which reported that trade union rights had been violated. Subsequently, on the basis of the contents of the ATE communication, the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) presented a formal complaint dated  April . The WCL also submitted additional information in a communication dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and  March .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  April and  June , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) states that, as a result of Decree No.  of July  passed by the Government of the Province of Corrientes, members of the ATE have to ""reaffiliate"" for their union dues to continue to be deducted under the check-off system. The complainant organization explains that the ATE is a first-level trade union body with legal personality whose members include staff of the Administration of the Province of Corrientes, that under trade union legislation it is entitled to have its members' union dues deducted from their wages, and that ATE, having complied with legislative provisions, has in the past been receiving these union dues on a regular basis.
.The complainant organization objects to the fact that the Government of the Province of Corrientes is using the decree in question to demand that persons working for the central provincial administration and decentralized bodies stipulate that they wish to join a trade union organization and authorize the deduction of their trade union dues.
.The complainant organization reports that it has initiated legal proceedings citing unfair practice with the Supreme Court of Justice, requesting that Decree No. / be declared unconstitutional and that, pending a ruling on the substance of the matter, the impugned decree not be applied. The complainant organization adds that the Supreme Court has agreed to this and ordered that trade union dues continue to be deducted, but that the Government of the province is refusing to comply with this ruling and that action has accordingly been initiated to enforce it.
.The complainant organization also states that the Executive of the Province of Jujuy enacted Decree No. / which violates trade union legislation and imposes additional requirements on the ATE to have its union dues collected. The Government of the province is demanding that workers provide written authorization stating their desire to join one of the legally established trade unions and have their dues deducted from their wages under the check-off system. In addition, the provincial administration will only deduct union dues for one trade union organization with legal personality chosen by the worker. Finally, the complainant organization states that, since the decree is unlawful, it intends to lodge an appeal with labour authorities and that if the provincial state administration maintains its position, it will appeal to the law courts.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states that, as Argentina has a federal system of government, the federal states (provinces) are empowered to take decisions in all administrative matters without any interference from the national Government, and that it was under this authority that the Government of the Province of Corrientes issued Decree No. /.
.The Government states with regard to Decree No. / that, following audits of the system of remuneration of provincial employees, the Government of the Province of Corrientes came across many people who were listed as being members of a trade union organization whereas in fact they had resigned their membership in accordance with the law. It was for this reason that it introduced a new wage payment and issued the decree requiring a photocopy of the workers' ""updated"" declaration of membership of a trade union for the province to continue to deduct their union dues. The authorities' requirement that workers express their ""current"" desire to have their union dues deducted from their pay was intended only to avoid deductions being made in the case of workers who for one reason or another had asked for their trade union membership to be cancelled.
.The Government further states that these provisions do not affect the right of workers to establish trade union organizations or to join or resign from them; nor do they imply any interference by the public authorities in trade union activities. On the contrary, they are part of an administrative reorganization of the wage payment system that is merely designed to comply with national legislation. The Government adds that, although the complainants claim that ATE members have to ""reaffiliate"", the decree does not call on anybody to join, rejoin or resign from ATE or any other trade union organization. On the contrary, it is a general provision applying to all organizations listed in the Trade Union Associations Act No.  and is designed to ensure strict compliance with that Act, specifically as regards the employer's obligation to deduct trade union dues under a reorganized and modernized system of paying wages.
.In its communication dated  March  the Government states that Decree No. / of the Province of Jujuy is part of the provincial administration's reorganization of the check-off system through which amounts due under various headings are deducted from workers' pay (trade union dues, commercial loans, purchase orders, purchase of goods and services, bank loans, etc.). The Government adds that trade union associations, specifically, must submit a document from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security certifying the legal personality, classification and sphere of activity of the trade union and its list of members, and must obtain the workers' written authorization before their union dues can be deducted from their wages by the public administration of the Province of Jujuy. Finally, the Government observes out that these formalities are merely to ensure compliance with the legal requirement under the Trade Union Associations Act No.  for employers to deduct union dues; the Province of Jujuy is careful to comply with this requirement even though it does not appear in any international labour Convention.
.The Committee notes that the allegations in this case relate to the modification by decree of the way the check-off system operates for public administration workers in the Provinces of Corrientes and Jujuy. The Committee also notes that the complainant organization's allegation that in the Province of Jujuy the impugned decree also stipulates that the public administration may only deduct union dues for one trade union chosen by the worker (although he or she may also be a member of another union), and that the latter must have legal personality.
.With regard to the impugned decrees, the Committee notes that the Government has stated that: () contrary to the complainant organization's claim, workers are not called upon to join, rejoin or resign from the ATE or any other trade union; () the decrees are part of the administrative reorganization of the wage payment system; () the audits that have been carried out revealed many instances of workers being listed as union members whereas in fact they had terminated their membership; and () the authorities have therefore made it a requirement that public administration workers indicate their ""current"" desire to continue using the check-off system for paying their union dues.
.Although the Committee regrets that the trade union organizations were not consulted prior to the enactment of the decrees in question, the Committee notes that the Government has given objective reasons for requiring workers to declare their trade union membership in writing in order to have their union dues deducted from their wages, and that this does not violate the principles of freedom of association.
.Furthermore, with regard to the allegation that Decree No. / issued by the Government of the Province of Jujuy provides that the provincial administration may only deduct union dues for one trade union organization (with legal personality) chosen by the worker, the Committee notes that the impugned decree does not prohibit workers from joining two or more trade unions or from paying dues to more than one organization - with the workers paying their contributions directly or in any other way envisaged by the organizations - but confines itself to stipulating that the check-off system may be used only for one of the trade union organizations.
.The Committee nevertheless notes that, like the national trade union legislation, Decree No. / of the Province of Jujuy requires that only trade union organizations with legal personality may benefit from the check-off system. The Committee wishes to remind the Government that for many years, when considering whether the Trade Union Associations Act No.  complies with Convention No. , the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (see the Committee's Report III, Part A, ) has called for the amendment or repeal of section  of the Act according to which only associations with legal personality (more representative), as opposed to those that are",0,1995,Argentina
295,"merely registered (less representative), may benefit from the check-off system. In this respect, the Committee notes that both Decree No.  and Act No.  pose the same problem with respect to the check-off system. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to have the Trade Union Associations Act No.  and Decree No. / of the Province of Jujuy amended so that workers can opt for deductions from their wages under the check-off system to be paid to trade union organizations of their choice, even if they are not the most representative.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to have the Trade Union Associations Act No.  and Decree No. / of the Province of Jujuy amended so that workers can opt for deductions from their wages under the check-off system to be paid to trade union organizations of their choice, even if they are not the most representative.",-1,1995,Argentina
296,".The complaints in this case are contained in communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated  June , the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA), dated  August  and the Union of Employees in the Tramway and Coach Services (UTA), dated  August . These organizations subsequently sent additional information (WCL:  April ; CTA:  August and  September ; UTA:  August and November ). In a communication dated  December , the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) expressed its support for the complaint made by the UTA.
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September ,  May and  July .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) alleges that the Government, in making a restrictive interpretation of the Trade Union Act in force and in violation of Convention No. , refuses to register as a trade union the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) (a third level organization, made up, inter alia, of the Confederation of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic, the Argentine Judicial Association, the Association of State Workers, the Argentine Trade Union of Naval Workers, etc.).
.The Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA) states that it is a third level trade union body, made up of trade union organizations of the first and second levels, but that a request made for its trade union recognition in May  was rejected by the Government. Furthermore, the CTA states that as a result of the social and economic policy of the Government, it decided to convene a strike (along with the Movement of Argentine Workers, a workers' organization whose registration was also rejected) to be held on  August , and which was supported by other trade unions with legal personality. The complainant organization states that the strike and the petition made to the Executive had, inter alia, the following objectives: the preparation of a national employment policy; the restructuring of the domestic market and the regional economies; job stability and protection; freely concluded collective agreements; free education at all levels; a national public health system, etc. The CTA adds that the Ministry of Labour issued a resolution declaring the strike illegal and ordered the organizations to refrain from strike action, which would result in the application of sanctions. Finally, the CTA states that for the purpose of declaring the strike illegal, the Government invoked, as one of its principal arguments, that the organizations which had convened the strike lacked legal personality. The CTA emphasizes that the right to strike is enjoyed by occupational organizations and is not a right which is granted exclusively to trade unions which have been granted legal personality.
.The Union of Employees in the Tramway and Coach Services (UTA) also refers to the strike of  August , and emphasizes that the strike was not of a political nature nor intended to disrupt public order, but was a multi-sectoral expression of protest against the social and economic policy of the Government. The UTA states that the Ministry of Labour declared the strike illegal and threatened to apply sanctions against the organizations which joined the strike. A few days after the strike preliminary legal proceedings were initiated against the organizations, including the UTA. Finally, the UTA says that the decisions of the administrative authority are contradictory, since on the one hand authorization was granted for participation in the strike if the minimum services were guaranteed, and on the other, the strike was declared illegal and any participation in it was subject to sanctions.
.In its communications of  September ,  May and  July , the Government states that the CTA is a third level trade union body whose structure has certain special characteristics as regards the scope of its representation, since provision is made for possible direct affiliation by individual persons - including retired or unemployed persons and workers exercising an autonomous activity - contrary to the provisions of Act No.  respecting trade union associations. The Government adds that trade union organizations must choose one of the forms established by the Act and that confederations or third level associations are those which group together associations, unions or trade unions of the first level and federations or trade union associations of the second level; compliance with this legal requirement does not affect freedom of association, since it is merely an elementary rule for organizing and facilitating harmony and peaceful coexistence within a social organization. The Government points out that the by-laws of the complainant organization must be brought into line with the Act in force before it can be granted legal personality. The Government encloses with its reply an opinion by the Ministry of Labour which states the grounds for rejecting the request for registration: they include the possibility for individual persons to join a third level organization directly, since for example the general assembly of the trade union organization requires ""some degree of homogeneity between the members represented in order to establish a genuine internal democracy"" and the fact that ""a confederation groups together only trade union associations"".
.As regards the declaration of the illegality of the strike, the Government states that the right to strike recognized by the national Constitution means the concerted and collective abstention from work by workers with a view to bringing pressure to bear on employers to obtain trade union objectives, and not, as in the present case, to bring pressure to bear on the public authorities to force them to carry out, or to refrain from carrying out, acts related to their own functions. The Government points out that the national Constitution, in considering strikes together with the right to conclude collective labour agreements and the right to conciliation and arbitration procedures, emphasizes that the right to strike is intended to defend the workers, but that almost all the trade union organizations which responded to the call for a general strike were not at that time engaged in any trade union dispute with their members' employers. The Government states that the stoppage in question was a strike of a clearly political nature, since it did not involve the defence of the particular or specific interests of workers in a given activity, but was the expression of pure and simple opposition to the social policy of the Government which the convening organizations said they could not accept. The action could not therefore be considered as a legitimate exercise of the right to strike. The Government states that although initial legal proceedings were initiated, no sanctions were applied against the organizations which participated in the general strike.
.Finally, the Government states that the continuous economic upheavals which Argentina has been experiencing for a number of years cannot be overlooked. Its citizens have been affected by the inflationary process which existed in previous years, and to attribute the responsibility for its effects to the present national authorities or the socio-labour policies which they are applying would be a distortion of the facts. It adds that the present policy of the Government has resolved the endemic problem of inflation affecting the country and that the Framework Plan for Employment, Productivity and Social Equity, which was concluded between the Government and the most representative organizations on  July , is proof of the existing political will to address the claims of the workers.
.The Committee observes that the allegations made in this case refer to the refusal to register a trade union (""trade union registration"") and the declaration of the illegality of a strike, as well as the threat of sanctions against trade union organizations which participated in the strike.
.As regards the allegation concerning the refusal to grant legal recognition (""trade union registration"") to the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA), the Committee notes that the Government states that the legal registration of the CTA has not been made because it is a third level trade union body which has certain special characteristics in its structure as regards its representation, whereby provision is made for direct affiliation by individual persons, contrary to the provisions of Act No.  respecting trade union associations (section  of the Act stipulates that ""Trade union associations may take one or more of the following forms: (a) trade unions or unions; (b) federations, when they are made up of base-level trade union associations; (c) confederations, when they are made up of associations described in clauses (a) and (b) above."").
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the CTA meets the requirement established by the Act for third level organizations, since it groups together first and second level organizations. However, the Committee also notes that, as the Government states, the CTA by-laws make provision for the possible direct affiliation to it of unemployed or self-employed workers or pensioners or retired persons (article  of the by-laws, a copy of which is appended to the Government's reply). The CTA's registration was refused",0,1994,Argentina
297,"on the basis of this provision of the CTA's by-laws.
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that organizations of employers and workers should have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules in conformity with Article  of Convention No. . The Committee therefore considers that the prohibition of the direct affiliation of certain persons to federations and confederations is contrary to freedom of association principles. It is for these organizations themselves to determine what the rules relating to their membership should be. In these conditions, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that the CTA is registered immediately.
.As regards the allegation concerning the declaration of illegality of the strike called by the CTA and other trade union organizations protesting the social and economic policy of the Government, the Committee notes that the Government states that the work stoppage in question was a clearly political strike, since it was not an attempt to defend the special or specific interests of workers in a given activity, but an act of pure and simple opposition to the Government's social policy, which could not in any way be considered as a legitimate exercise of the right to strike. In this respect, the Committee reminds the Government that on various occasions it has pointed out that ""trade union organizations should have the opportunity to call for protest strikes particularly with a view to exercising criticism of the social and economic policy of governments"" (see th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (Dominican Republic), para. ) and that ""the right to strike should not be limited solely to industrial disputes that are likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement; workers and their organizations should be able to express in a broader context, if necessary, their dissatisfaction as regards economic and social matters affecting their members' interests"" (see nd Report, Case No.  (New Zealand), para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that in future protest strikes against the social and economic policy of the Government are not declared illegal.
.As regards the allegation of sanctions applied against the trade union organizations which participated in the strike (initiation of preliminary legal proceedings), the Committee takes due note of the Government's statement that although such proceedings were initiated, no sanctions were applied to the bodies which participated in the general strike of  August .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to proceed with the immediate trade union registration of the Congress of Argentine Workers (CTA).(b) The Committee requests the Government to refrain in future from declaring illegal protest strikes against the social and economic policy of the Government.",3,1994,Argentina
298,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Educational Workers of the Argentine Republic (CTERA) dated  November . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , the Confederation of Educational Workers of the Argentine Republic (CTERA) alleges that on  November  the Ministry of Labour and Social Security decided to cancel elections which had been called by the Union of Educational Workers (UTE) and scheduled to be held that same day. It adds that the Ministry of Labour decided to declare the notice of the elections null and void, and to require that new elections be called, on the grounds that a number of trade union members who were not candidates in the election had objected to the use of ""mobile"" ballot boxes (i.e. ballot boxes which would be shifted from one site to another) at  of the  polling places.
.The complainant organization points out that even if one grants that the authorities were entitled to rule on the practice of ""mobile"" ballot boxes, the penalty is disproportionate, since by declaring the call for elections null and void, a new notice of elections must be issued, and the elections will consequently be delayed by a minimum of three months.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that in view of a challenge by a fraction of the trade union organization (and not only by members who are not candidates in the election), the National Office of Trade Union Associations declared the elections in question null and void, considering them in violation of applicable regulations (the Government attaches the resolution to its reply). Moreover, the Government states that the executive committee appealed the decision and subsequently withdrew its appeal, accepting the decision by the competent authorities. Lastly, the Government states that the complainant organization has already held new elections.
.The Committee notes that the allegations refer to the cancellation of elections concerning the Union of Educational Workers (UTE) by the National Office of Trade Union Associations.
.The Committee notes the Government's observations according to which:
.In these circumstances, noting that the Ministry of Labour intervened at the request of a fraction of the complainant organization and that new elections were subsequently held, which have not been challenged, the Committee, while recalling that it is not authorized to render decisions on conflicts between trade union fractions within the same organization, considers that this case does not call for further examination.

.In its communications of  November  and January , the Confederation of Education Workers (CTERA) alleges that the Executive of the Province of La Rioja refused to grant a trade union leave of absence to Messrs. Rogelio de Leonardis and Roberto Nieto, the Secretary-General and the Trade Union Secretary respectively of the Association of Schoolteachers of the Province of La Rioja (AMP). The complainant organization adds that the trade union officials refused to do so. They once again demanded that their trade union leave of absence be granted, but the authorities disregarded their right and dismissed them, without taking into consideration the unanimous opinion of the disciplinary board of the province (a tripartite and autonomous body of the Provincial Council of Education) that the dismissal was contrary to their inalienable right to automatic leave of absence as trade union officials.
.Similarly, the complainant organization alleges that the Government of the Province of La Rioja did not transfer the trade union dues deducted from the members of the Association of Schoolteachers, and in the same way decided not to deduct any further trade union dues from October , even though the education workers had given their express consent to such deductions.
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that in a resolution issued in October , the Minister of Education and Culture of the Province of La Rioja ordered ""the reinstatement in their posts, from  February , of Messrs. Rogelio de Leonardis and Roberto Oscar Nieto"" and the payment of outstanding salaries due (the Government encloses a copy of the said ministerial resolution).
.The Committee observes that the allegations made in this case refer to the dismissal of two trade union officials of the Association of Schoolteachers of the Province of La Rioja, as well as the failure to transfer to the trade union organization the trade union dues deducted by the authorities and the subsequent decision not to deduct any more trade union dues.
.As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of the trade union officials of the Association of Schoolteachers of the Province of La Rioja, Messrs. Rogelio de Leonardis and Roberto Oscar Nieto, for having made use of trade union leave of absence, the Committee notes with interest the Government of the province has ordered their reinstatement in their workplaces and the payment of their outstanding salaries due. Furthermore, the Committee expresses the firm expectation that the Government will take the necessary measures to ensure that in future the authorities do not obstruct the legal exercise of trade union leave of absence.
.As regards the allegation concerning the failure to transfer to the Association of Schoolteachers of the Province of La Rioja the trade union dues deducted by the authorities of the province, the Committee regrets that the Government has not communicated its observations in this respect. The Committee therefore requests the Government, if these allegations are true, to take the necessary steps immediately to ensure that the Government of the Province of La Rioja transfers forthwith to the trade union organization in question the dues deducted from the trade union members. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Furthermore, as regards the allegation concerning the decision of the authorities of the province to stop deducting trade union dues from October , despite the express consent by the workers, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations in this respect and recalls that ""the deduction of trade union dues by employers and their transfer to trade unions is a matter which should be dealt with through collective bargaining between employers and all trade unions"" (see th Report, Case No.  (Russian Federation), para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee encourages the parties to negotiate with a view to reaching an agreement in this respect.

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

The Government sent additional information in communications dated  November  and  July . The WCL sent its comments in a communication dated  April .
.The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) alleges in its communications dated  and  November  that systematic violations of Act No.  on trade union associations have been taking place at the National Mint. The WCL specifies that the National Mint enterprise banned elections which were due to be held on  December  to name the delegates' executive of the Association of State Employees (ATE), and that it is still refusing to receive the current delegates' executive, despite the fact that it was elected over a year ago by  per cent of the members.
.Lastly, the WCL alleges that the workers affiliated to the ATE are penalized with arbitrary dismissals and suspensions for minor mistakes and that there has been a disproportionate increase in the number of security staff in order simply to monitor workers. The complainant organization annexes to its complaint a request for information addressed by the National House of Deputies to the Chairman of the National Mint in which it states, among other things, that ""this is an intolerable situation for the workers employed by the enterprise; the general management adopts arbitrary positions, there is trade union persecution, reprisals are taken against the staff and there are operating problems (...). This honourable House must therefore intervene as compliance with the basic human rights (industrial and trade union rights among others) of the enterprise's employees, who through their work with the currency defend national sovereignty, is under threat"". ""At the National Mint there is an absolute and total lack of protection, as demonstrated by the fact that it is impossible to move around the enterprise without identification papers, (...) by the installation of unnecessary numbers of cameras to monitor workers' movements (...) by unfair practices contrary to the ethics of occupational relations, etc."" The WCL also refers to a series of other unfair practices and violations of workers' rights which are unrelated to freedom of association, and which are thus not reproduced in this report.
.In its communication of  May , the Government points out, as regards the refusal by the authorities of the National Mint to recognize the delegates' executive of the Association of State Employees (ATE), that the National Civil Servants' Union (UPCN) has traditionally acted as the majority trade union in the National Mint and has elected delegates who represent the entire staff. Furthermore, the National Mint collectively negotiated wage increases with the UPCN, which were endorsed by the Ministry of Labour. The Government emphasizes that Act No.  on trade union associations establishes the principle of unity of trade union representation and establishes the number of delegates according to the number of staff employed.
.The Government adds that on  December , the ATE called elections for the delegates' executive in the National Mint while an executive consisting of members of the UPCN had already been set up in the proportion stipulated by law (in this case, ten delegates). Since the UPCN traditionally represented the workers in this state enterprise and the ATE appeared later, it was necessary for the ATE to request that the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations carry out a procedure for trade union recognition (to determine which of the two associations would represent the rights of the workers). This procedure gave rise to Case No. ./, which is still pending; until the case is resolved the previous situation should be maintained.
.In addition, the Government continues, the National Mint filed a complaint with the administrative authorities requesting that they pronounce these elections as illegal on the basis of the above-mentioned considerations and because the UPCN had more members than the ATE. At the same time, a second-instance appeals court ruled, in a case brought before it by the ATE, that the National Mint was not responsible for any unfair practices.
.The Government concludes by indicating that there were no violations of freedom of association and that this is a case where the trade union representation must be determined (as two unions are vying for the same representation) and that, when the time comes and this question is resolved, the National Mint will be obliged to recognize the most representative trade union.
.Lastly, in its communication of  May , the Government states that given the nature of the articles manufactured at the National Mint the services of a security company are necessary to stop any criminal activities taking place and that the current number of cameras corresponds to security requirements. In addition, the Government sent its observations on the allegations concerning the violations of workers' rights which are unrelated to freedom of association, and which are therefore not reproduced in this report.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that the National Mint has refused to recognize the delegates' executive of the ATE, which was elected in  by more than  per cent of its members (in addition, in  the election of this executive was banned), that its management has refused to receive the delegates' executive, and that various anti-union acts have been perpetrated against the members of the ATE. The Committee notes that, according to the information sent by the Government, since  an executive has existed composed of members of another trade union organization (the UPCN) which represented the workers, and that because of the legal principle of unity of trade union representation the ATE in  had to request a ""procedure for trade union recognition"" to be carried out by the authorities to determine which of the two organizations should represent the rights of the workers.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that in respect of the ""procedure for trade union recognition"" to determine which of the two trade union organizations active in the National Mint is the most representative, the Ministry of Labour has determined that the UPCN is the most representative body and that a ministerial decision exists to that effect.
.The Committee observes with concern that the administrative decision concerning trade union recognition was delayed from  to . In addition, it notes that the Government has not sent its observations on the allegations relating to sanctions (arbitrary dismissals and suspensions) imposed on ATE members nor to the refusal by the management of the National Mint to receive the ATE's delegates' executive. Noting the marked decrease in ATE members during the period in which the administrative procedure for trade union recognition was carried out (from  to  as a result of the resignation of  worker members) and in view of the pressure prevailing in the enterprise during that period (the National House of Deputies considered it necessary to address a request for information to the National Mint), for the Committee there is persuasive evidence that acts of anti-union discrimination have been directed against workers belonging to the ATE.
.The Committee reminds the Government that ""it is not necessarily incompatible with the Convention to provide for the certification of the most representative union in a given unit as the exclusive bargaining agent for that unit. This is the case, however, only if a number of safeguards are provided that include the following: (a) certification to be made by an independent body; (b) the representative organization to be chosen by a majority vote of the employees in the unit concerned; and (c) the right of an organization which fails to secure a sufficiently large number of votes to ask for a new election after a stipulated period"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ). The Committee also wishes to call the Government's attention to the fact that ""the granting of exclusive rights to the most representative organization should not mean that the existence of other unions to which certain involved workers might wish to belong is prohibited and that minority organizations should be permitted to carry out their activities and at least to have the right to speak on behalf of their members and to represent them"" (see th Report, Case No.  (New Zealand), para. ).
.The Committee therefore requests the Government to take the necessary measures to permit the ATE trade union at the National Mint to exercise its activities freely (particularly to be allowed access to management), and to be able to call elections to freely elect its executive members. The Committee also requests that, after a reasonable",-1,1993,Argentina
301,"period, the trade union organization which considers itself the injured party be enabled to request a new procedure to determine, under the supervision of an independent body, which organization is the most representative. The Committee emphasizes that the authorities should take the necessary measures so that this procedure results rapidly in a decision.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Reminding the Government that the granting of exclusive rights to the most representative organization should not mean that the existence of other unions to which certain involved workers might wish to belong is prohibited and that minority organizations should be permitted to carry out their activities and at least to have the right to speak on behalf of their members and to represent them, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to allow the ATE trade union at the National Mint to exercise its activities freely, and to be able to call elections to freely elect its executive members.(b) The Committee requests that, after a reasonable period, the trade union organization which considers itself the injured party be enabled to request a new procedure to determine, under the supervision of an independent body, the most representative organization. The authorities should take the necessary measures so that this procedure result rapidly in a decision.",4,1993,Argentina

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  July and  October , the National Federation of University Professors (CONADU) alleges that despite having complied with every legal requirement, authorities have not granted it union personality, thus preventing it from engaging in collective bargaining.
.In its communication of  January , the Government replies that based on a resolution of  November  (copy attached), the Ministry of Labour and Social Security granted union personality to the National Federation of University Professors (CONADU).
.The Committee observes with interest that the problem referred to by the complainant organization has been satisfactorily resolved by the granting of union personality via the resolution of  November  by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.",5,1993,Argentina
303,".The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in March  (see nd Report, para. ). The case concerns the dismissals which occurred between  January  and  December  for political and trade union reasons of unionists employed in banking institutions, as well as the non-observance of Act No.  which protects bank employees dismissed for political or trade union reasons. During its last examination, the Committee expressed the hope that the parties would be able to reach an agreement as quickly as possible.
.In its communication dated  October , the Bank Association states that, following a tripartite meeting on  May  where the representatives of the employers and of the unions put forward their positions, and after sanctions had been imposed on the banks which violated Act No. , the Government has not convoked any new tripartite meetings nor has it undertaken any legal proceedings with the goal of requesting the full implementation of Act No.  (the complainant organization adds a list of dismissed workers and the names of the banks which have not applied Act No. ).
.In a communication dated  February , the Government states that it is going to transmit the list of dismissed workers sent by the complainant organization to the banks requesting them to provide information on the status of the re-examination of the persons mentioned with a view to a further evaluation of the situation, in line with the Committee's recommendations. The Committee takes note of this information. Recalling once again the importance it attaches to the effective implementation of Act No. , the Committee requests the Government to continue to make all efforts to find a negotiated solution as quickly as possible.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Banking Association (Association of Bank Employees) of  May . The Government responded with a communication of  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May  the Banking Association (Association of Bank Employees) alleges that the provisions of Act No.  of  September  - which grants a preferential right of access to their previously held jobs to bank workers who were suspended from their posts and/or made redundant for political reasons or for participation in trade unions between  January  and  December  - have not been observed by the private banking industry (mainly foreign banks) and have been only partially observed by the state banking industry, both of which have deliberately recruited new staff.
.The complainant points out that this refusal to reinstate employees is not based on economic reasons, as their number is not significant for each financial institution. The reasons must be political or based on their trade union participation, since dismissal has always been used widely to pressure trade unionists and political activists in general.
.Finally, the complainant sends a list of  trade unionists who are former employees of  banking institutions and who made use of this preferential right under the aforementioned law, and includes numerous annexes. Of the  dismissed workers,  lost their jobs during the major banking strike of  which lasted  days; the rest were dismissed between  March  and  December  and were victims of the arbitrary repression of the military dictatorship. This list covers banks which are in operation.
.In its communication of  May , the Government, referring to the alleged lack of observance of the provisions of Act No. , states that the alleged violation of freedom of association in no way refers to an act of the national Government, but rather is the result of activities by banking institutions which are able to acquire rights and undertake obligations, and that the Ministry of Labour cannot compel them to observe such obligations by any means other than those which fall within its own legal competence and which are referred to below. The Act in question stipulated that certain former banking employees were to benefit from a preferential right to reinstatement in their jobs. It covered employees who were suspended from their posts, made redundant, dismissed or transferred to administrative bodies where the conditions of work were different from that in banks in the period from  January  to  December  inclusive. These former employees were to benefit from the law if they lost their jobs at state banks, whether they are national, provincial or municipal; at private or mixed banks; at banks of the former General Directorate of Personnel and State Guaranteed Loans or at banks of the Institute of Social Banking Services for political reasons or owing to their participation in trade unions or in strikes or other industrial action. Section  of this Act established a period of  working days from the date of publication of the Act in the Official Bulletin, in which workers could exercise this preferential right by sending a telegram or an official letter expressing their desire to be reinstated. The provisions of section  obliged the various employers to draw up a list of personal data of workers who complied with this law, and to submit a copy thereof to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and to the Banking Association. The employers were obliged, when a vacancy occurred in one of the institutions mentioned in the Act to, fill it with preference with one of these workers by inviting him in good faith to take the post, and to communicate this reinstatement to the administrative labour authority and to the trade union association.
.The Government adds that one may conclude from the above that, in any case, Act No. , apart from not establishing the Ministry of Labour's responsibility for the application of its standards, merely assigned to the Ministry the obligation to provide means for the application, and not responsibility for the final results. Indeed, the function of the administration in this case is to supervise compliance with the legal standard in question, as is the case with any labour standard. This is a function fulfilled by the National Directorate of Labour Inspection; in the event of concrete complaints of cases where the standards are not observed, the task of mediating between the parties to find a conciliatory solution is fulfilled by the National Directorate of Labour Relations.
.In this regard, the Government emphasizes that in the present case, and as noted in the complainant's own statements, the first of these functions was completely and satisfactorily fulfilled by the Ministry through numerous inspections conducted by the National Directorate of Labour Inspection, which not only instructed the offending banks to observe the legal provisions in force, but also applied the appropriate sanctions to them for obstruction of administrative procedures (section  of Act No. ). As regards the second of the functions described above, it should be emphasized that the National Directorate of Labour Relations was consulted regarding the procedures initiated based on complaints of specific violations of the provisions of Act No. , and that it reported that only three cases had been registered, for the Boston, Sudameris and Avellaneda banks. Of these cases, reinstatement was only obtained for one former employee of the Avellaneda Bank, but not for the rest of the workers.
.Unfortunately, under the mandate given to it by the legislation in force, once the Ministry of Labour has instructed the offending institution to comply and has exhausted its mediation and conciliation efforts without reaching an agreement between the parties, its administrative role is completed. The administrative authority is not competent to deal with individual disputes. The way is then clear for the worker to bring any complaints he deems appropriate before the courts, as for example a complaint relating to the payment by his employer of compensation provided under section  of the Contracts of Employment Act. Indeed, under section  of the legal standard in question, the only sanction provided in the event its provisions are not observed is the payment to the affected worker of compensation equivalent to that which would be due to the worker for dismissal without just cause under the current legislation.
.The Government concludes by stating that the administration has consistently expressed its desire to resolve this problem and to reconcile the parties by acting within the mandate given to it by law; if this procedure has failed then it is up to the parties to make their claims before the judicial authority as explained in the preceding paragraph. There has thus been no violation of the freedom of association, and this case should therefore be dismissed by the Committee.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that, in violation of Act No.  of  September ,  former employees of  banking institutions who were dismissed for political reasons or for participation in trade unions between  January  and  December  were denied reinstatement",2,1993,Argentina
304,"in their posts. The Committee notes that the Government states that the Ministry of Labour fulfilled the task assigned to it under this law, mediating between the parties to find a conciliatory solution, instructing the offending banks to comply with the law and applying the appropriate sanctions for obstruction of administrative procedures. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, when the parties do not reach an agreement, the affected workers may bring the case before the courts and may thus be awarded compensation equivalent to that which under the legislation in force would be due to the worker for dismissal without just cause.
.The Committee should like to emphasize that Act No.  defends bank employees who were dismissed for political reasons and/or for participation in trade unions. Because of the Committee's mandate, the following conclusions apply only to those workers dismissed because of their participation in trade unions in the period covered by Act No. . The Committee notes that the allegations and the Government's statements differ as regards the number of dismissed workers who were not reinstated with a preferential right to reinstatement: according to the complainant organization, there were  former employees of  banking institutions, while according to the Government, complaints of violations of Act No.  refer only to the Boston, Sudameris and Avellaneda banks (in the last bank, one of the former employees was, however, reinstated).
.In these circumstances, the Committee emphasizes the importance it attaches to the effective and quick observance of Act No.  of . Therefore, in light of the differing information given by the complainant and the Government as regards the number of former bank employees dismissed for trade union activities (and the number of banks concerned), the Committee requests the Government to hold discussions with the Banking Association, and with the relevant employers' and employees' organizations, with the aim of determining the exact names and number of former employees who have not been reinstated despite their preferential right to reinstatement. Independently of the available judicial and administrative remedies, the Committee requests the Government to promote new conciliatory measures and arrangements which may be concluded between the parties with the aim of reaching an agreed settlement. Where reinstatement is impossible, because of the age of the former bank employees who were dismissed decades ago, or because of other valid reasons, the Committee considers that the injured parties should receive the compensation provided by law as soon as possible.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee emphasizes the importance it attaches to the effective and timely application of Act No.  of .(b) In light of the differing information given by the complainant and the Government, as regards the number of bank employees dismissed for trade union activities (and the number of banks concerned), the Committee requests the Government to hold discussions with the Banking Association and with the relevant employers and employers' organizations, with the aim of determining the exact names and number of former employees who have not been reinstated despite their preferential right to reinstatement.(c) Independently of the available administrative and judicial remedies, the Committee requests the Government to promote new conciliatory measures and arrangements which may be concluded between the parties with the aim of reaching an agreed settlement.(d) Where reinstatement is impossible, because of the age of the former bank employees, or because of other valid reasons, the Committee considers that the injured parties should receive the compensation provided by law as soon as possible.(e) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this case.",2,1993,Argentina
305,".The complaint in this case appears in a communication from the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) dated  November . In a communication dated  November , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) endorsed the complaint made by the CGT. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) as well as the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the allegations made in this case refer to the promulgation of Executive Decree No. / to deregulate port activities and Decree No. / respecting the transportation by sea, river and lake of passengers, cargo and fish as well as all port activities. Specifically, the allegations refer to: () the suspension of  collective agreements in the sector; and () the obligation to renegotiate the collective agreements and, in particular, those clauses, acts, agreements or any other standard-setting act in the sector, which establish working conditions detrimental to productivity or which impede or obstruct the normal exercise of management and the administration of enterprises.
.The Committee notes that to justify the decrees in question the Government points out: () that the authorities were facing a crisis situation which obliged them to choose between the gradual and continuous reduction of sources of work in the sector and the automatic renegotiation of conditions of work in the sector; () that under acts which predate the respective decrees and on which the latter are based, activities in the water transport sector and port services have been subject to privatization and/or decentralization through the transfer of powers to the provinces, municipalities or the private sector on a concessionary basis (Decree No. /); () the need to bring the entire economic and production sector of the nation - and not only transportation by sea, river and lake and ports, the subject of this complaint - into line with the new conditions imposed by growing international competition; () that major international transporters prefer to unload their goods in the ports of neighbouring countries and then transport them to Argentina over land which is cheaper; and () the recent incorporation of the economy into a regional integration framework (MERCOSUR) which requires the free circulation of goods, services and production factors between the signatory parties (Decree No. /).
.In this case, over and above the magnitude of the economic requirements to which the Government refers, the Committee would like to point out that on previous occasions (see, for example, st Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ), in examining allegations of the annulment and forced renegotiation of collective agreements for reasons of economic crisis, the Committee was of the view that ""legislation which requires the renegotiation of agreements in force is contrary to the principles of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. "" and insisted that the Government ""should have endeavoured to ensure that the renegotiation of collective agreements in force resulted from an agreement reached between the parties concerned"".
.In this respect, the Committee would like to emphasize that the suspension of the validity of the  collective agreements in question, along with the obligation to renegotiate them, were in fact tantamount to their derogation and, furthermore, that these requirements were imposed by a decree. In these circumstances, with account being taken of the principles set forth in the previous paragraph, the Committee cannot accept the derogation - without the agreement of the parties - of such collective agreements freely entered into by the parties and believes that such measures violate the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining established in Article  of Convention No. . Therefore, it requests the Government to ensure that, in future, these principles are respected fully.
.The Committee requests the Government to ensure, if it wishes the clauses of a collective agreement to be brought into line with the economic policy of the country and the requirements resulting from the latter's integration into an international common market, that attempts are made to persuade the parties to take account voluntarily of such considerations, without imposing on them renegotiation of the collective agreements in force.
.As regards the matter concerning the need for future collective agreements to respect the productivity criteria, the Committee has already expressed its views on this subject in a previous case presented by the CGT, the complainant organization in this case (see th Report, Case No.  (Argentina), paras. ,  and ) and it refers to the conclusions reached and the recommendation made at that time:The Committee is aware that at times, when confronted with economic restructuring in general, and inflation in particular, governments may adopt measures which entail restrictions on the negotiation of wage rates in collective agreements. In this respect, the Committee wishes to point out that it has already had occasion to give its opinion on similar allegations to the effect that collective bargaining is being subordinated to the interests of the Government's economic policy in Argentina, and specifically to productivity criteria (see th Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Argentina), paras. -). In November , when it dealt with these cases, the Committee examined a Decree (No. /) under which ""clauses of the agreements may be waived (by the administrative authority in the public sector) if they disrupt productivity, hinder or interfere with the administration of the enterprise"" (see th Report, para. ).In these circumstances, the Committee restates the conclusions reached at its November  meeting at which it recalls that both the Committee and the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had insisted ""that if within the context of a stabilization policy a government may consider for compelling reasons that wage rates cannot be fixed freely by collective bargaining (in the present case the fixing of wage scales excludes index-linking mechanisms and must be adjusted to increases of productivity), such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards. This principle is all the more important because successive restrictions may lead to a prolonged suspension of wage negotiations, which goes against the principle of encouraging voluntary collective negotiations"" (see th Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Argentina), para. , General Survey on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, , para. , and rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Chile), para. ).Consequently, taking into account the specific nature of the system of collective bargaining in Argentina and noting that the limitations on collective bargaining go beyond a reasonable period, the Committee expresses the hope that the Government will be able, as soon as possible, to meet the objectives of its economic plan so as fully to restore the right to collective bargaining.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that, in the future, the principles of free and voluntary collective bargaining be fully respected.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure if it wishes the clauses of a collective agreement to be brought into line with the country's economic policy and the requirements of the country's integration into an international common market, that attempts are made to persuade the parties to take account voluntarily of such considerations, without imposing on them renegotiation of the collective agreements in force.",0,1992,Argentina
306,".The complaints in this case appear in communications received from the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the Urban Transport Workers' Trade Union (UTA), dated  November , and in a joint communication from the Aeronautic Workers' Association (APA), the Commercial Airline Administrative Workers' Trade Union (UPSA), the Aeronautic Technical Workers' Association (APTA) and the Commercial Airline Flight Technicians' Association (ATVLA) of February . Subsequently, in communications dated December  and  April , the Urban Transport Workers' Trade Union submitted additional information and new allegations. In a communication of  January  the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) associated itself with the complaint submitted by the UTA.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November  the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) alleges that in response to a number of problems faced by the trade union movement the CGT called for a general -hour strike on  November, to which the Government responded by seeking to apply in respect of several trade unions in the services sector the provisions of Decree No. / (concerning ""procedures to prevent or resolve labour disputes""), with the threat of sanctions and reprisals.
.In their communications of  November , December  and February , the UTA, the APA, the UPSA, the APTA and the ATVLA add that given the prospect of various conflicts of interest in the transport sector (ground and air) and the prospect of a general strike, the Government promulgated several ministerial resolutions in order to apply arbitrarily Decree No. /, by establishing transport as an essential service, and thereby undermining the right of workers' organizations in this sector to organize their activities and formulate their programmes of action.
.Specifically, the complainants object to the classification of transport as an essential service (section , paragraph ), the imposition of minimum services established unilaterally by the public authorities, and the excessively high percentage of compulsory minimum services in the case of air transport ( per cent for flights to the country's southern region,  per cent for the rest of the country, and  per cent for international flights) and ground transport ( and  per cent for urban services, and  per cent for long-distance services). The complainants also object to the measures which government authorities threatened to apply in the event that the workers failed to provide the minimum services established by the Ministry of Labour. These measures include compulsory arbitration, the declaration of strikes as illegal and the suspension or revocation of the trade union's legal status (sections ,  and  of the Decree).
.Lastly, in its communication of  April , the UTA states that the Ministry of Labour responded to a dispute between the Buenos Aires Underground Transport Enterprise (a state-owned enterprise) and its workers by extending to this form of transport the provisions of Decree No. /, and ordering that a minimum service should be provided during the dispute. The complainant organization alleges that in April  the Ministry of Labour, citing the failure to provide minimum services (which it established unilaterally in the absence of an agreement between the parties), declared illegal the strike which the workers had undertaken, and threatened the trade union with the suspension or revocation of its legal status.
.In its communication of  November  the Government states that Decree No. /, which governs the right to strike, was issued in accordance with the regulatory powers given to the Executive Branch by the National Constitution, that the right to strike is constitutionally guaranteed, and that this right has been regulated successively by Act No.  (on procedures for the handling of disputes), Act No.  (on compulsory arbitration), Decree No. / (on the resolution of collective disputes between state-owned enterprises and their staff), and lastly, by the Decree in question. The Government states that the regulation of strikes highlights the lawfulness and importance attached to this right in national legislation; moreover, as the right to strike is governed by the above-mentioned Acts, the Executive Branch is constitutionally authorized to regulate its exercise.
.The Government points out that it not only recognizes the right to strike, but also promotes machinery for the prevention and settlement of labour disputes, although it prefers that the parties themselves establish dispute settlement machinery. It adds that owing to the period of recession, inflation and fiscal deficit which the country experienced in the s, the Government promulgated emergency economic and state reform legislation, and set up machinery to avoid the prolonged or complete interruption of essential services, thereby establishing a balance between the general interest and the rights of parties to a specific dispute.
.The Government states that the Decree in question contains a conceptual and generic definition of essential services for the purpose of ensuring that minimum services are provided in the event of a strike; the Decree further provides that upon learning of a labour dispute which comes under its competence by virtue of Act No. , the Ministry of Labour shall proceed to determine whether such dispute will affect, in whole or in part, certain of the services mentioned in the Decree. The Government clarifies that in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Decree, the parties must agree on the steps to be taken to ensure that the minimum services are provided throughout the dispute, and, in the absence of such an agreement, the determination of minimum services shall be made by the Ministry of Labour, which shall avoid an arbitrary decision by consulting the competent ministry or government agency. Likewise, the Decree provides that in respect of those activities or enterprises in which a collective or enterprise agreement calls for the provision of minimum services, full compliance must be given to such agreement, failing which the public authorities will enforce its application. The Government emphasizes the fact that it has not suppressed the right to strike in the essential services, but has established a procedure to regulate this right, in which the interested parties have a voice.
.As regards the provision which establishes that recourse will be had to compulsory arbitration in the event that strike action is taken without respecting the requirements concerning the provision of minimum services which have been agreed to or established, the Government states that this is in accordance with the provisions of Act No. , which was never contested by trade union organizations and which has been applied routinely for years.
.Moreover, the Government states that transport has been included among those services whose complete or partial interruption might endanger the life, health, freedom or safety of part of the population or of persons, since it plays an essential role in the country, by uniting geographically distant points; in addition, account must be taken of the serious consequences which would ensue from an interruption of transport as regards the provision of food, the transfer of sick people, etc. Lastly, as regards the frequencies established for such minimum services, the Government repeats that these frequencies were determined after consultation with the competent government agency, namely, the Transport Department of the Ministry of Economy, Works and Public Services, and that these minimum frequencies do not prevent the exercise of the right to strike, but only limit or restrict it in certain specific cases, to the extent that they represent an essential and necessary service for the community.
.The Committee notes that the allegations submitted in this case concern the content and application of Decree No. / (concerning the ""procedures to prevent or resolve labour disputes""), as regards the establishment of minimum services in the transport sector.
.In the first place, as regards the statutory requirement for maintaining a minimum service (section  of the Decree) during strikes in the transport sector, whether by land, air or rail, the Committee agrees with the Government's statements which emphasize the need to attend to the general interest and highlight the fundamental function of transport in the country, which covers a large geographical expanse, as well as the negative consequences for the population deriving from the absence of a minimum service (the distribution of food, the transport of sick people, etc.). The Committee considers that the transportation of passengers and commercial goods is not an essential service in the strict sense of the term (one the interruption of which might endanger the life, safety or health of all or part of the population); however, this is a public service of primary importance in the country, where the requirement of a minimum service in the event of strike can be justified. In these conditions, the Committee considers that, in this case, the requirement of a minimum service in the transport sector in the event of a strike does not violate the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the allegation concerning the unilateral establishment of minimum services by the Ministry of",-1,1992,Argentina
307,"Labour, the Committee notes that, according to section  of the Decree, such a measure is taken only in the absence of agreement between the parties, which are consulted in any event. In this connection, the Committee has already had occasion to give its opinion on similar allegations concerning the establishment of a minimum service in the public services, and reiterates its pertinent conclusions, to the effect that in the event of differences of opinion among the parties concerning the scope of a minimum service in the public sector, ""legislation should provide that such a dispute should be resolved by an independent body"" (see st Report of the Committee, Cases Nos.  and  (Peru), para. ), and not by the Ministry of Labour or the ministry or public enterprise concerned.
.As regards the power of the Ministry of Labour to declare a strike illegal in the event that the parties fail to comply with the minimum service requirements (section  of the Decree), and to submit the dispute to compulsory arbitration (section  of the Decree), and, if applicable, to request the courts to suspend or revoke the legal status of the trade union organization concerned (section  of the Decree), the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that trade union organizations had never previously objected to Act No. , which establishes compulsory arbitration. In this connection the Committee had previously noted that the recourse to compulsory arbitration in the event of strikes should be confined to essential services in the strict sense of the term (those whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of all or part of the population) (see th Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Colombia), para. ), and that transport is not one of these services.
.Moreover, the Committee notes that the administrative authorities may declare a strike illegal if the minimum service agreed between the parties is not provided, but that Decree No. / allows administrative authorities to declare a strike illegal in other cases, specifically, in the event of the infraction of other legal requirements. In this connection the Committee has previously considered that in the event of strikes ""the final decisions concerning the illegality of strikes should not be made by the Government, especially in those cases in which the Government is a party to the dispute (see th Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).
.As regards the possible suspension or revocation of the legal status of trade union organizations for not providing the mininum service throughout the strike, the Committee considers that such measures are not acceptable. In this respect, it notes that section  of the Decree in question states that ""in respect of trade union organizations which provide, encourage or support strike action which is considered illegal, the competent authority may proceed to implement the provisions of clauses  and  of section  of Act No.  (concerning trade union associations)"". In this connection the Committee notes that clause  of Act No.  concerns the request by the Ministry of Labour to trade union organizations to renounce measures which entail the infraction of legal or statutory provisions, or the non-compliance with provisions issued by the competent authority in the exercise of its legal prerogatives; and that clause  provides that the courts may suspend or revoke a trade union's legal status when the trade union fails to comply with requests issued under clause , and when it is proved that the trade union is guilty of serious administrative irregularities. In these conditions, while noting that the final decision to suspend or revoke a trade union's legal status is made by an independent judicial body, the Committee reiterates that such measures should not be adopted in the case of non-compliance with minimum service.
.As regards the allegation concerning the high requirements established for the minimum service, the Committee notes that the Government states only, and then in a general way, that the levels of minimum service are determined after consultation with the competent agency, in this case the Transport Department of the Ministry of Economy, Works and Public Services, and that these minimum levels do not prevent the exercise of the right to strike, but only limit or restrict it in specific cases which constitutes an indispensable service for the community. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government has not, at first sight, commented on the high percentages of minimum service cited by the complainants which, in certain cases, stand at  or  per cent, which effectively constitute a prohibition to the right to strike. The Committee therefore cannot exclude the possibility that excessive minimum service levels were in fact established, even though the strike in question never materialized. Nevertheless, as it has done on previous occasions, the Committee emphasizes that ""a definitive ruling on whether the level of minimum services was indispensable or not - made in full possession of the facts - can be pronounced only by the judicial authorities, in so far as it depends, in particular, upon a thorough knowledge of the structure and functioning of the enterprises and establishments concerned and of the real impact of the strike action"" (see th Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Uruguay), para. ).
.As regards the allegation submitted by the UTA concerning the declaration that strike action taken by the workers of the Buenos Aires Underground Transport Enterprise was illegal, and the alleged threat to suspend or revoke the trade union's legal status, the Committee notes that the Government has not furnished specific information. Nevertheless, the documentation submitted by the complainant organization indicates that when the parties failed to reach an agreement, the labour authorities established the level of minimum service to be provided during the dispute, that the UTA as well as the Buenos Aires Underground Transport Supervisory Staff Association were warned to rescind all measures which would affect the provision of a minimum level of service, and that the strike action was ultimately declared illegal when the minimum service levels were not met. The Committee notes that since the complaint was submitted in April , the complainant has not sent new information that would enable the Committee to determine whether effect was given to the threat of suspending or revoking the trade union's legal status. In these conditions the Committee refers to its earlier conclusions on the importance of ensuring that any decision concerning the illegality of a strike in the public services and the establishment of minimum service in the absence of agreement between the parties should be handled by an independent body.
.In consideration of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures with a view to amending legislation so that final decisions concerning the illegality of strikes and the establishment of a minimum service in the absence of an agreement between the parties are left to an independent body. Furthermore, the Committee brings this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures with a view to amending legislation so that final decisions concerning the illegality of strikes and the establishment of a minimum service in the absence of an agreement between the parties are left to an independent body.(b) The Committee draws the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",3,1992,Argentina
308,".The complaint is contained in communications from the United Trade Union of Education Workers of Mendoza (SUTE) dated  May and  July . Subsequently, the SUTE presented further information in a communication dated  September . The Government sent its comments in a letter dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  May and  July , the United Trade Union of Education Workers of Mendoza states that pursuant to elections to appoint titular and deputy shop stewards to represent unionized staff members, Mrs. Raquel Blas de Mora and Mrs. Alba Jauregui de Rego, amongst others, were appointed titular shop stewards in the nursery school of the Godoy Cruz municipality, Province of Mendoza. The complainant organization adds that the municipality's new authorities decided to dismiss both trade union leaders in May  without having sought the appropriate authorization in advance to lift their trade union immunity. It states that this decision was clearly taken with the aim of infringing trade union rights by encouraging other education workers to leave the organization or by deterring them from taking part in union activities. Finally, the complainant organization states that after an administrative appeal for annulment was presented and rejected, an application for the enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) was lodged in court.
.In its communication dated  September , the complainant organization alleges that deductions were made from the wages of the teaching staff in the province who had participated in strike action. It states that the provincial Government did not institute any judicial proceedings to declare the strike unlawful and that, consequently, the deduction for July  was made without the formal communication of any decision or order from the authorities to the staff concerned or the union chapter representing them.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states in respect of the allegation relating to the dismissals of two teachers at the Godoy Cruz nursery school No.  that the establishment in question is not administered by the Ministry of Education of the Province of Mendoza but by the municipality as a crche for children aged six weeks to four years in which staff are subject to the statutes applicable to provincial public employees. Similarly, it emphasizes that the persons in question were not dismissed but simply that their contracts signed with the municipality were, inter alia, not extended as has been the case for other workers.
.Moreover, although the teachers in question have invoked their status as trade union leaders, the Government states that such status is undocumented in the Godoy Cruz municipal archives. For the teachers to be entitled to the protection afforded to trade union leaders it would be necessary not only for the posts to have been won in elections but also for the employer to have been notified thereof officially and at the proper time, neither of which was the case.
.In respect of the claim for the payment of amounts deducted from July  wages as a result of participation in industrial action by the staff of schools administered by the Directorate General of Schools of the Province of Mendoza, the Government states that on  November  the deducted amounts were reimbursed to the staff in question.
.The Committee observes that the allegations made refer, first of all, to the termination of the contracts of two teachers at the nursery school in the Godoy Cruz municipality, in the Province of Mendoza, who had been appointed shop stewards and, secondly, to wage deductions from teachers' pay in the Province of Mendoza pursuant to a strike in July . On the latter score, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that these wage deductions were reimbursed in November .
.In respect of the allegation that the contracts of two teachers at the nursery school in the Godoy Cruz municipality were terminated, the Committee takes note of the Government's comment that the workers in question were not dismissed but that their contracts with the municipality were simply not extended as has been the case for other workers; and that there is no documentary evidence in the Godoy Cruz municipal archives that these workers held office as trade union leaders.
.On the basis of the supporting documentation submitted by the Government, the Committee observes that the persons in question were indeed not dismissed but that the fixed-term contracts they signed with the Godoy Cruz nursery school No.  were not extended and that the anti-union nature of the non-extension invoked by the complainant is not substantiated by any documentary or circumstantial evidence (e.g. combative attitudes on the shop stewards' part, recruitment of other persons subsequent to non-extension, etc.), but by mere value judgements (according to the complainant organization this measure is intended to intimidate other union members).
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the present case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that the present case does not call for further examination.",5,1992,Argentina

The Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the complaints presented refer to questions which fall outside the competence of the National Executive and which are a matter for the judiciary. It states that the judiciary is one of the three powers of the State which is not only independent of the Executive but is furthermore absolutely autonomous and has its own functions, powers and budget.
.The Government states that both in December  and June  the measures of direct action carried out by staff in the judiciary resulted in the total paralysis of judicial activities, without minimum services being provided and obliged the magistrates themselves to deal with urgent tasks. In both cases the Supreme Court had to issue a number of Orders (resolutions) suspending the legal procedure which paralysed the dispatch of all judicial cases pending, which shows that the measures taken caused serious prejudice to the administration of justice. There is no doubt that the administration of justice must be considered as an essential service, or at least as a paramount public function in which, according to the principles of the ILO, there is justification for some limitation on the exercise of the right to strike.
.The Government states that although in principle the Ministry of Labour and Social Security automatically intervenes in a labour dispute, the legal system is such that this administrative intervention occurs at the request of one of the parties concerned. It points out that in neither of the two conflicts did the UEJN request the intervention of the Ministry of Labour, thus establishing the validity of the action taken by the Supreme Court. Furthermore, the Government states that Decree No. /, in defining essential services, expressedly stipulates that the administration of justice shall be considered such a service only ""at the request of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation"", which means that the legal standard excludes any possibility whereby the Ministry of Labour may intervene in disputes arising within the judiciary if this is not specifically requested.
.Finally, the Government points out that the content of Orders (resolutions) Nos. / and / does not indicate that there was a prohibition of the right to strike but only that its exercise was to be suspended during periods of conciliation. It states that this can be seen from the fact the after the conciliation period of December , the complainant once again carried out measures of direct action in June .
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations in this case allege that following different measures of direct action carried out in December  and June  by workers of the judiciary grouped together in the UEJN, the Supreme Court decided to establish a period of compulsory conciliation and to suspend the exercise of the right to strike during this period. Moreover, the complainants state that the Supreme Court is not competent to impose such measures since it is a party to the dispute.
.The Committee notes that the statements of the complainants and the Government are contradictory as regards certain aspects of this case. According to the complainants, the necessary minimum service was guaranteed at all times whereas according to the Government, the strike carried out by staff in the judiciary resulted in the total paralysis of judicial activities, without the provision of minimum services. Moreover, while the complainants consider that the competent body to examine this dispute is the Ministry of Labour, the Government points out that the organization concerned did not request intervention of the Ministry of Labour in this matter.
.While noting these contradictory statements, the Committee observes that, in this case, the right to strike of staff in the judiciary is not prohibited by legislation. However, on two occasions - in December  and June  - the Supreme Court of Justice, following strikes organized by workers in the sector, ordered a period of compulsory conciliation of  days and the suspension of the right to strike during this period.
.The Committee has accepted that the right to strike may be restricted or even prohibited in the civil service - civil servants being those who act on behalf of the public authorities - provided that these restrictions are accompanied by certain compensatory guarantees, such as adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , rd edition, paras.  and ). Moreover, the Committee has considered that recourse to compulsory conciliation and arbitration procedures in industrial disputes before calling a strike cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.As regards the present case, the Committee considers that staff in the judiciary should be considered as civil servants acting on behalf of the public authorities and that as a result, the authorities were justified in suspending the exercise of the right to strike of this staff.
.The Committee notes, however, that the complainants claim that in the disputes that are the subject of the complaint, the Supreme Court was both judge and party to the conflict since the Court is the employer of staff in the judiciary, on the one hand, and it suspends the exercise of the right to strike of its staff, on the other.
.In this respect the Committee has recalled that Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, provides that the settlement of disputes arising in connection with the determination of conditions of employment shall be sought, as may be appropriate to national conditions, through negotiation between the parties or through independent and impartial machinery, such as mediation, conciliation and arbitration, established in such a manner as to ensure the confidence of the parties involved.
.It would appear that in the present case, the conciliation procedure imposed by the Supreme Court was not established in such a manner as to ensure the confidence of the trade unions of the staff in the judiciary.

311,".The complaints are contained in communications from the Federation of Ceramic Workers of the Argentine Republic (FOCRA) dated  April , in a communication from the General Confederation of Labour of the Argentine Republic (CGT) dated  June  and in a communication from the Association of Airline Pilots dated  December .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  December .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  April and  June , respectively, the FOCRA and the CGT allege that the Government, through its promulgation on  August  of Decree No. /, is violating the right of collective bargaining.
.The complainants state that article bis of the National Constitution guarantees the right of unions to engage in collective bargaining for the purpose of regulating the pay and working conditions of their members, and that Act No.  of , as amended by Act No.  of , establishes a procedure for the collective negotiation of labour relations between trade unions and employers, with the State acting as custodian of the general interest by verifying the legitimacy of the act of approval and by reserving to itself the powers of observer.
.The complainants point out that Act No.  on the convertibility of the Austral (the Argentine currency during the period -), which came into effect in April , prohibited as of that date any index-linking or monetary restatement and abolished all legal or regulatory standards establishing or authorizing price indexing, monetary restatement, cost adjustment or any other means of revaluing debts, taxes, prices, or tariffs in respect of goods, works or services. This decision also applies to existing legal relations and situations, it being prohibited, up until  April , when the Austral became convertible, to apply or to use any legal, regulatory, contractual or conventional clause - including clauses in collective labour agreements - from a previous date as grounds for adjusting the size of payments to be made in Australs. According to the authorities, this Act was passed with the aim of halting inflation in Argentina by establishing parity between the Austral and the United States dollar. They explain that the Act prohibits the parties from agreeing automatic wage adjustment clauses based on price indices, monetary restatement or any other form of automatic revaluation.
.Under Decree No. /, the parties are obliged, prior to negotiating wage scales, to agree upon the bases for calculation and the method to be used for measuring productivity within the scope of validity of the agreement, it being understood that those bases and that method must be approved by the administering authority prior to the fixing of wage scales. In this connection, the complainants point out that section  of the Decree stipulates that, for the purposes of approval, the authority shall ensure: (a) that the agreement does not contain any clauses which infringe the norms of public order and that no index-linking mechanisms are established which are prohibited by the Act on convertibility of the Austral; and (b) that the entry into force of the agreement does not significantly affect the overall economic situation and that any salary increases are granted on the basis of genuine increases in productivity, whether verified or reasonably estimated.
.The complainants conclude that Decree No. / limits wage negotiation to the question of productivity increases, excluding any other parameter, and that the administrative authority intervenes on two occasions, namely prior to any wage negotiation, when approval must be obtained from the Ministry of Labour for the calculation bases and the method used to measure productivity, and in the act of approval, when the Ministry intervenes to verify whether the wage increases agreed to relate to effective increases in productivity.
.In conclusion, the complainants state that the fact that wage negotiation is based solely upon productivity and that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been set up as the supreme judge in respect of any agreement reached by the parties undermines the freedom and voluntariness of the parties that is essential to the collective bargaining process. The complainants indicate their acceptance of the restriction as an emergency measure, but go on to explain that free wage discussion should be the rule. Since, however, the Decree in question presents itself as a decree regulating the Acts on convertibility of the Austral and on collective labour agreements, the exceptional nature of the restrictions on free wage negotiation accepted by the ILO become, in Argentina, a general principle, with no exceptions being made with respect to free negotiation. The aim of Decree No. / and of the Act considered by the Executive Power to be the basis of that Decree is the achievement of economic stability and an end to inflation. That aim is widely shared by the working class and its legitimate representatives. The complainants point out, however, that since the Decree has been fully in force, wages have remained frozen, while inflation indices and the cost of living have continued to rise. The means adopted by the Executive Power is not the right one to achieve the proposed aim. Finally, the complainants note that neither in the preambular nor in the normative part of the Decree are its provisions referred to as being of a transitory nature, the effect of this being that regulations of a permanent nature are thus established.
.In its communication of  December , the Association of Airline Pilots (APLA) also presented allegations to the effect that Decree No. / violates the right to collective bargaining, adding that in the particular case of pilots the Ministry of Labour omits to set up joint committees to consider situations like that of pilots, who, since decisions as to the number and frequency of flights are wholly a matter for the employer, are unable themselves to effect a direct improvement in productivity. The APLA adds that it has now been over a year since Aerolneas Argentinas SA, and over six months since Lneas Areas Privadas Argentinas SA, requested that a joint committee be set up, without any result having been achieved. The complainants point out that in the case of Aerolneas Argentinas the number of pilots has been reduced from  to , resulting in an indirect productivity increase of  per cent. They state that by failing to set up a joint committee within the time-limit stipulated in Act No. , the State is intervening in trade union affairs and denying the right to negotiate collective agreements.
.This complainant organization further alleges that through the promulgation of Decree No. / the Government is intervening in trade union affairs by imposing administrative regulations on the right to strike. The complainants likewise point out that the Ministry of Labour does not protect the unionized workers of Aerolneas Argentinas SA in connection with complaints relating to infringements of the labour laws, such as those involving numerous mass dismissals.
.In its communication of  December  the Government states that it is engaged not only in the implementation of a traditional economic recovery plan, but also in a deep and effective structural transformation of the nation, aimed at removing each and every one of the obstacles which historically have undermined successive economic plans set up to solve the endemic problem of inflation. Thus, the Government has not only embarked upon a deep restructuring of the administrative apparatus of the State, but has also undertaken a complete deregulation of its economy and a modernization and updating of its general legislation, this being the context and scope within which Decree No. /, questioned by the complainant organizations, was issued. In other sectors, however, that instrument has not given rise to any objection.
.The economic and social results of this government plan are, for the first time in many years, within reach of all Argentinians. Suffice it to say that after all these years the inflationary process has at last been effectively contained, to the extent that whereas on  April  - the date on which,  months ago, the Convertibility Plan came into effect - the rate of increase in consumer prices (cost of living) had reached  per cent, the corresponding figure for the past  months has scarcely risen above  per cent. Although it is true that this process has not yet been fully consolidated and that many changes remain to be made in Argentina in order to facilitate a more just salary system through an improved distribution both of wealth and of the contributions required from its citizens, it is no less true that these circumstances cannot be ignored by the legitimate representatives of the Argentine working class, since the first to suffer from inflationary processes are precisely those who, like workers, live on a fixed monthly or fortnightly income, and who experience the degradation which results from the daily and constant reduction in their purchasing power due to inflation. It is therefore",0,1992,Argentina
312,"impossible to understand why such obstinate attacks are being made upon one of the pillars of current Argentine economic policy by those who, in short, represent one of the sectors which derive the greatest benefit from its implementation, given that the purchasing power of wages is now assured, the level of economic activity of the nation is constantly rising and the previously endemic problem of unemployment is constantly decreasing.
.The Government asserts that the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) lacks the substantial legitimacy necessary to invoke the right allegedly violated, since the power to negotiate agreements is inherent in the nature of the first-level association, or in any case those which bring together the specific units from the activity in question. This power constitutes, moreover, an essential element of freedom of association, as is the right of negotiation of these first-level associations, constituting as it does the most suitable mechanism for making collective bargaining specific to each sector, according to the particular activity involved. Encouragement is therefore given to horizontality in negotiation, this being a characteristic that is conducive to effectiveness. The principle of horizontality in collective bargaining is reflected in Convention No. , which recognizes the respective trade union organization as being the body entitled to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of workers, since it is the most suitable in so far as the representativity of the interests of the sphere of activity in question is concerned. The confederal body may only act by delegation; consequently, the power to negotiate is an inherent right of the first-level association.
.The CGT should have attached the appropriate documents testifying to a democratic decision by the deciding body of the trade union association to submit a representation of this kind, thus reflecting the mandate of its constituent trade unions, since, as we have already stated, the matter under discussion does not fall within its competence. In the light of the foregoing, the Government requests the Committee not to recognize representations submitted autonomously by the CGT, which is unjustifiably putting itself forward as representative of the majority of its constituent associations, since those associations are engaged in an electoral process.
.Decree No. / does not limit powers of negotiation, but on the contrary serves to encourage collective bargaining concerning the economic conditions of labour agreements, although confining them to the particular circumstances in which the country's general economic activity has been developing subsequent to the promulgation of Act No.  on convertibility, within the framework of which the Decree in question was issued. It is in this context that that Decree establishes specific guidelines to ensure that any collective negotiation of salaries by the contracting parties is in line with the basic thrust of the economic policy and anti-inflationary measures currently in force. In order to ensure that this aim is achieved, it also establishes specific guidelines to be followed by the administrative authority when it comes to analyse the contents of agreements prior to granting them approval. This is how it is and how it should be, given that collective labour agreements are not merely contractual agreements between the signatory parties, but that precisely by virtue of the legal provisions governing current agreements in Argentina (Act No.  and its complementary instruments), those which have received administrative approval acquire erga omnes effects, meaning that they will be binding not only upon the signatory parties, but also upon all those undertakings included within the scope of their commercial or industrial activities. It is precisely this circumstance which gives full legitimacy to the provisions of the Decree in question, since the principles established therein should only be complied with by those agreements to which the parties wish to accord erga omnes effects, since at no time does the legal instrument in question diminish the validity of any other agreements which may have been concluded without falling into line with its provisions, which - as such - and by virtue of the provisions of section  of the Civil Code, shall have full validity and shall be binding upon the signatory parties.
.The Government explains that the erga omnes effect of approved agreements, as provided in the Argentine legal system, requires that the administrative authority, prior to granting approval, must, as laid down in section bis of Decree No. , ensure that the collective agreement does not contain any clauses which infringe the norms of public order or standards issued in the protection of the general interest, that it does not significantly affect the overall economic situation, and that it does not result in a serious deterioration in the standard of living of the population. This provision is not a violation introduced into the Argentine legal system by virtue of Decree No. /, since the same regulations with the same content were already provided by Act No. , since which time they have been in force, continually and without alteration. The only modification introduced by the Decree in question is that it limits the check on legality to be carried out by the administrative authority prior to approving agreements to the economic guidelines and policies currently in force and flowing from the provisions of Act No.  on convertibility, to which reference has already been made.
.The Government points out that Decree No. / was enacted by the national Executive by virtue of the regulatory powers attributed to it under article () of the National Constitution. The Supreme Court of Justice has declared that regulatory decrees issued by the national Executive under its constitutional powers become part of, regulating and completing, the corresponding Acts, with any violation or misinterpretation being deemed contrary to the statutory rules established by the relevant Act. The Decree in question simply affirms that indexation is prohibited, as was already established by the Act on Convertibility, and sets out guidelines so that parties may amend negotiating criteria which are incompatible with the aforementioned enactment. If the Decree had not been enacted, then the Ministry of Labour and Social Security would have been unable to approve wage agreements based on inflation, since the Act on Convertibility, which relates to public order, precludes this. The Decree is therefore tenable, since it is a necessary affirmation of or follow-on to the Act on Convertibility, which has at no time been called into question by the complainants. Given the compatibility of the Decree and the Act, the Decree is tenable by virtue of the constitutionality of the Act. Decree No. / was enacted with Act No. , which is in line with the convertibility plan, as its specific antecedent. For its part, Act No.  provides for the derogation, prohibition and inapplicability of any indexation procedure as of  April .
.Taking into account the country's state of economic emergency, the Government is constantly seeking to ensure equity in the collective effort, through opening the capital sector up to external competition through economic liberalization and through seeking to establish price equilibrium and thus reduce profit margins. This delicate balance must also include in its equation elements which guarantee the labour supply. It is important to note that it is not the Government which is putting limits on negotiation, but the particular circumstances in which the Argentine economy currently finds itself. Thus it is that while workers find themselves having to negotiate within the context established by the aforementioned standards, employers too are seeing their receipts being limited as a result of economic liberalization. The ILO has, on various occasions, given its opinion on the issues involved and has always recognized that certain economic circumstances could result in conditions being placed upon negotiation, provided this does not involve abusive intervention on the part of the administration and that those conditions arise naturally out of a given economic situation.
.With regard to the question of approval or act of approval by the administrative authority, the Government states that that act does not imply endorsement or rejection of a collective labour agreement, but merely gives it erga omnes effects. A collective labour agreement which has not been approved remains a valid agreement between the signatories. It can therefore be concluded that Decree No. / does not violate the freedom to negotiate between parties but merely instructs the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on how to comply with the Act on Convertibility. In this sense, the function of the Decree is threefold: () to instruct the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on which safeguards should be borne in mind when approving a collective labour agreement, so as to ensure compliance with the Act on Convertibility; () to draw to the attention of the parties the fact that a condition of approval is that the agreement should respect specific rules (i.e. that agreements must be concluded according to the guidelines specified in the Decree, these having been agreed by the legislators to be the only technically viable ones; and that any agreement concluded which violates the procedures established in the Decree will not be approved, although a collective labour agreement concluded between the signatories",4,1992,Argentina
313,"remains valid at all times); and () to instruct the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to offer technical support to the parties with a view to their varying the negotiating criteria and availing themselves of the opportunity to negotiate on the basis of productivity which, technically, is the only way to achieve real wage increases, as is the case elsewhere in the world.
.It points out that the powers to grant approval that are vested in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security are, with very few changes, the same as those wielded by the Government since , that is, since the enactment of Act No.  and its regulatory Decree No. / brought into being the country's only specific legal system for collective bargaining. In that original legislation, section  of the Act provided for ministerial authority to grant approval, whilst section  of Decree No. / detailed that authority in almost the same way as does the current section  of Act No. , in which the only changes, included since , are the ""norms of public order"" to be guarded by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. It is not Decree No. /, but rather the Act itself, which, as specifically mentioned in the third whereas clause of the Decree, provides for the aforementioned checks to ensure the absence of any violations of general public and economic order (section (), Act No. ). The preambular part of Decree No. / specifically mentions Act No.  (on convertibility), through which the national Government exercised its power to fix the value of the currency (article () of the National Constitution), thus unequivocally associating itself with public order. One follow-on from that Act was the prohibition of all forms of indexation, that is, of the very practice whose absence, the complainants maintain, amounts to a restriction on the freedom of wage negotiation. But this prohibition is in no way unreasonable, since indexation was one of the practices which undermined the value of the currency and subsequently that of wages, since any increases were, in turn, passed directly on to prices. With indexation prohibited by Decree No. /, productivity remains the only natural and genuine bargaining factor for a society which has been particularly sensitized by the atypical problem - whose highly unusual characteristics have not been experienced by many countries - of hyper-inflation. In the circumstances, the linking of productivity as a wage-setting guide with monetary stability is not only an obvious move, but is referred to in the original text of the instrument regulating Act No. .
.In addition to the reference to productivity as having a logical relationship with wages, it must be pointed out that no other possible criterion exists for increasing wages without seriously jeopardizing either production (by completely exhausting the enterprise) or the value of the currency (through price increases). For a short period, or on an occasional basis, it may be possible to consider increasing wages and not prices, but ultimately, if wage increases do not correspond to an increase in productivity, then inevitably - with more money in circulation and an unchanging level of production - those increases will be passed on to prices. That in turn would bring down the value of the currency, or, as stated in Act No. , it would ""result in a serious deterioration in the standard of living of consumers"".
.As regards the question of the freedom to negotiate, the Government emphasizes that at no time does the approval of a collective labour agreement, in pursuance of Decree No. /, serve as a means of restricting collective autonomy, and that, on the contrary, the parties are at complete liberty to negotiate, even outside the terms of the Act on Convertibility. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is in a position to provide the parties with the necessary assistance to enable them to negotiate within the guidelines established by that Act, which, given their technical nature, are a more suitable basis on which to proceed. Decree No. / has a reference to productivity which is sufficiently flexible to allow for wages to be negotiated freely, although with due attention being paid to the aforementioned guidelines. This, simply stated, means that the reality of the situation must be borne in mind. So, even though section  of the Decree requires the parties to provide information on productivity, section bis(b) says that, for the purposes of wage agreements, the productivity increase in question may be checked or merely estimated, thus opening up such a broad and extensive range of possibilities within which to consider the concept of productivity that it is difficult to imagine what could realistically lie outside it. It emerges, therefore, that Decree No. / amounts to no more than a logical and necessary follow-on from the provisions of Act No. . In conclusion, it is impossible to challenge a Decree which does not violate the freedom to negotiate and whose content is a direct follow-on from an unchallenged Act relating to public order.
.Finally, the Government points out that following the promulgation of the aforementioned legal instrument the Ministry arranged a series of meetings under the auspices of the National Directorate of Labour Relations for the purpose both of instructing those of its staff members responsible for conducting wage negotiations on how to proceed within the framework of that instrument, and of informing the parties involved on the scope and content of the standards contained therein. It explains that countless negotiating committees have been and will continue to be set up within the Ministry with a view to improving the economic conditions of many more collective labour agreements within the framework of that legal instrument. In all such cases, moreover, the workers covered by those agreements are and will continue to be represented by the same trade union organizations which were signatories to the agreements that were in force up until that time, and which are the same organizations that the CGT claims to represent. Many of those negotiating committees have already completed their task, having considered wage agreements in which the productivity clause or clauses emerging from the system under analysis have been respected, the majority of those agreements having been approved by the administering authority (the Government encloses a list of the wage agreements approved within the framework of Decree No. / up to  July ).
.Firstly, as regards the Government's statement rejecting the CGT's authority to submit allegations in the absence of any corresponding authorization from its affiliated organizations, the Committee considers that any national confederation has a direct interest in the issues surrounding the promulgation of legal standards and regulations relating to collective bargaining, and that the complaint of the CGT should thus be deemed receivable from the point of view of the Committee's procedure.
.The Committee notes that the allegations relate to the promulgation of Decree No. /, regulating Act No. . (which provides for the derogation, prohibition and inapplicability of any indexation procedure as of  April ), in the sphere of contracts of employment or employment relationships. The allegations refer specifically to the requirement under that Decree that wage negotiation be conducted solely on the basis of increased productivity under Decree No. /, excluding any other parameters, and to the intervention by the administrative authorities, initially when approval is needed from the Ministry of Labour for the bases used for calculation and the method used to measure productivity, and subsequently when approval is granted subject to ministerial verification of whether the wage increases granted correspond to genuine productivity increases.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's information, and particularly of the economic problems which have been facing the Argentine Republic for many years, and of the fact that the Government has launched an adjustment plan which involves the structural transformation of the economy involving total deregulation and the modernization and updating of legislation in general. The Committee has also taken note of the improvements which, according to the Government, have resulted from the plan.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that according to the Government, Decree No. / was enacted by the Executive Power by virtue of the regulatory powers vested in it by the National Constitution (article ()), and that it simply reaffirms that indexation is prohibited (as already established by the Act on Convertibility) and sets out guidelines so that parties may amend negotiating criteria which are incompatible with that enactment; that approval by the administrative authority does not imply endorsement or rejection of a collective labour agreement, but merely accords to that agreement erga omnes effects: that is to say that it is applicable to all those undertakings included in the sectors concerned even if they are not parties to the agreement. This approval of a collective agreement, according to the Government, does not limit the freedom to negotiate, since productivity is referred to in a manner that is sufficiently flexible to allow for the free negotiation of wages while still taking the provisions of the Decree into account.
.The Committee notes that",-1,1992,Argentina
314,"the productivity criterion is a requirement that parties generally take into account during collective bargaining, although its application to specific categories of workers may give rise to very difficult problems, as the Association of Airline Pilots has emphasized in this case, with reference to the pilots it represents. The Committee notes that Act No.  and Decree No. / prevent the extension of a collective agreement which would not take into account the prohibition on indexation (as stipulated in the aforementioned Act) and the limitations with respect to increased productivity (as provided for by the Decree). The Committee observes in this respect, that in the Argentinian system of industrial relations, the near totality of the most important collective agreements are subject to approval by the administrative authority. It therefore considers that in the national context, the limitations entailed by the Act and the Decree in question do not allow parties to the collective bargaining process a completely free hand.
.The Committee is aware that at times, when confronted with economic restructuring in general, and inflation in particular, governments may adopt measures which entail restrictions on the negotiation of wage rates in collective agreements. In this respect, the Committee wishes to point out that it has already had occasion to give its opinion on similar allegations to the effect that collective bargaining is being subordinated to the interests of the Government's economic policy in Argentina, and specifically to productivity criteria (see th Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Argentina), paras. -). In November , when it dealt with these cases, the Committee examined a Decree (No. /) under which ""clauses of the agreements may be waived (by the administrative authority in the public sector) if they disrupt productivity, hinder or interfere with the administration of the enterprise"" (see th Report, para. ).
.In the circumstances, the Committee restates the conclusions reached at its November  meeting at which it recalled that both the Committee and the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had insisted ""that if within the context of a stabilization policy a government may consider for compelling reasons that wage rates cannot be fixed freely by collective bargaining (in the present case the fixing of wage scales excludes index-linking mechanisms and must be adjusted to increases of productivity), such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards. This principle is all the more important because successive restrictions may lead to a prolonged suspension of wage negotiations, which goes against the principle of encouraging voluntary collective negotiation"" (th Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Argentina), para. , General Survey on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, , para.  and rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Chile), para. ).
.Consequently, taking into account the specific nature of the system of collective bargaining in Argentina and noting that the limitations on collective bargaining go beyond a reasonable period, the Committee expresses the hope that the Government will be able, as soon as possible, to meet the objectives of its economic plan so as fully to restore the right to collective bargaining.
.With regard to the allegation of the Association of Airline Pilots (APLA), relating to Decree No. / on the right to strike, the Committee will examine it in the framework of Case No. , in which detailed allegations have been submitted on this subject. With regard to the alleged lack of protection for workers at the Aerolneas Argentinas SA enterprise in connection with mass dismissals, the Committee observes that the APLA's allegations refer not to violations of trade union rights but to other rights contained in labour legislation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Taking into account the specific nature of the system of collective bargaining in Argentina and noting that the limitations on collective bargaining under Act No.  and Decree No. / go beyond a reasonable period, the Committee expresses the hope that the Government will, as soon as possible, be able to meet the objectives of its economic plan, so as fully to restore the right to collective bargaining.",-1,1992,Argentina
315,".The Committee examined these cases at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see the th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st meeting in November ). The Confederation of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic (CTERA) furnished further information in a letter dated  January .
.The Government sent further observations in letters dated  January,  February and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the suspension of clause  of collective agreement No. / (ADEFA-Argentine Railways) by virtue of a Decree, the Committee notes the Government's statement that this measure is the subject of court action and that the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice is awaited in the matter. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the Court's ruling.
.As regards the allegation of administrative and legislative obstacles to collective bargaining in the education sector, the Committee notes with interest that a law on collective bargaining in this sector has recently been passed. The Committee further notes that notifications have been sent with a view to establishing bargaining commissions.
.Referring to the alleged dismissal of public sector staff representatives, the Committee notes that according to the Government three of the workers in question were not trade union representatives and that all the workers mentioned in the allegations were members of the administration working in a temporary capacity, appointed for a fixed and a predetermined period to cover the exceptional and temporary needs of the State. In these circumstances, since the complainants had given no details on the circumstances of the dismissals, the Committee considers that these allegations call for no further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the ruling of the High Court of Justice on the suspension of clause  of Collective Labour Agreement No. / (ADEFA-Argentine Railways) by virtue of a Decree.
.The allegations presented in this case against the Government of Argentina are contained in communications from the Association of Management Staff of Argentine Railways and the General Ports' Administration (APDFA) of  November  and January ; in communications from the Confederation of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic (CTERA) of  November  and  January ; in a letter from the Association of State Workers (ATE) of  December ; in communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) of  January and  February  and in communications from the Argentine Association of Airline Crew (AAA) of  December  and  February . The Government replied in a communication dated  August .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the APDFA alleges that Decree No. / of  July  (sections , , , , , , ,  and ) is undermining its right to undertake free negotiations with regard to the pay and working conditions of its members, thus violating the terms of Conventions Nos.  and .
.The APDFA points out that in September , Act No.  was promulgated, known as the Act respecting the Economic Emergency, and that section  thereof mentions a situation of collective danger arising out of the serious economic and social circumstances facing the nation. Section  of the Act authorises the Executive to review work regulations for staff in the public service or elsewhere, with a view to eliminating factors which could jeopardise efficiency and productivity. The same provision lays down that among other measures, summoning and/or creating collective bargaining machinery ... made it possible for joint agreements to be reached to carry out the provisions in this article. Thus, the possibility of unilateral decisions on the part of the Executive is reduced, since it is expressly stated that any possible ""review"" of the collective agreements must be done through a joint agreement. This is also laid down in section  of the Act.
.The complainant emphasises that Decree No. / continues the theme of the need to eliminate factors which may jeopardise efficiency and labour productivity in public enterprises, although the Decree emphasises that these very objectives must be met within the existing legal framework, keeping collective bargaining as a suitable instrument for governing the activity of workers. However, in spite of this affirmation, the Decree maintains that with a view to making the negotiating process easier, it has been deemed necessary to waive those clauses which conflict with the objectives of efficiency and productivity, until new agreements are reached.
.Furthermore, in Chapter III of the Decree (wages policy) employers' representatives on negotiating committees are deprived of any degree of flexibility with regard to wage agreements with trade union organisations. Wages have to fall in line with pay increases unilaterally decreed by the Executive for the public administration. So, indirectly, it is the Executive which determines remuneration for the sector of workers covered by collective agreements, thus precluding any negotiation except when an agreement is reached on granting wages below the ""ceiling"" (sections  to  of the Decree).
.The complainants go on to state that in Chapter IV (collective labour agreements) negotiations to renew the agreements may begin without delay (section ), which is quite acceptable. On the other hand, there are grounds for complaint in that there is an attempt to impose a fixed time-limit in which the collective agreement must be concluded. Otherwise, if an agreement is not reached, the national Executive will take steps to ensure that the terms laid down in section  of Act No.  are met.
.According to the APDFA, section  of Decree No. / contains the most blatant violation of the right of trade unions to engage in collective bargaining since, under the pretext of a ""short-term necessity"", clauses of the collective agreement are being openly waived when they supposedly ""disrupt productivity"", hinder or interfere with ""an enterprise's managerial and administrative capacity"".
.The complainant's communication concludes that the State is acting as both judge and jury in the following way: (a) the Government draws up its economic plan and determines adjustment policy; (b) government-appointed managers of public enterprises determine which clauses of the collective agreement conflict with ""efficiency and productivity""; (c) the trade union involved has five days in which to draw up pertinent ""comments"". A failure to do this is seen as ""consent""; (d) the Ministry of Labour and Social Security - an administrative department of the State itself - makes the final decision on waiving the terms of the collective agreement in question. In conclusion, the State determines economic policy; the State, as employer, puts forward amendments to collective agreements; and the State as administrative authority makes a decision on the possible ""comments"" drawn up by the trade union concerned.
.In a further communication of January , the APDFA refers to the practical application of Decree No. / with regard to certain collective agreements and in particular to collective agreement No. /, clause  of which, listing the occupational categories represented within the Argentine Railways company, has been suspended. The suspension was requested by the Acting President of the Technical Advisory Committee on Public Sector Wage Policy. The APDFA contested the request within the statutory five-day limit, but lost its case; it was ruled that clause  of the collective agreement should be suspended until new collective labour agreements had been approved.
.The APDFA's members are divided up according to categories. It represents the management and professional staff of Argentine Railways, of the General Port Administration and of the Institute of Social Services for Railway Staff. The application of Decree No. / to collective agreement No. / violates the principle of freedom of association, because in view of the APDFA being a trade union representing staff in different categories, and clause  specifying in the collective agreement which occupational categories the trade union represents at the level of collective bargaining, a suspension of this clause means that the representative function of the trade union is eroded.
.In its communication dated  November , the CTERA states that, on  August , its organisation requested the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to join it in elaborating a collective agreement for the sector, to provide a framework for arriving at agreements on wages, conditions and terms of work, how to reduce risks, and social and occupational benefits.
.The CTERA, when it formed part of a national preparatory committee along with provincial educational authorities, requested the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to develop the legal instruments for the formal constitution and functioning of a National Agreement for Education Workers. The Ministry of Labour's reply, through a legal ruling against the request, argued that a special",-1,1990,Argentina
316,"Act would need to be passed in Congress in order to set up a collective agreement for the education sector.
.The complainant adds that despite this ruling made by the Ministry of Labour itself, it has put obstacles in the way of the Bill on Collective Agreements for the Education Workers of the Argentine Republic and neglected to bring it before the Congress, thus barring its implementation, against the advice of the Ministry of Labour itself, in accordance with the judgements made by the General Directorate of Labour Relations.
.The complainant adds, moreover, that the Bill on Collective Agreements for Education Workers was drawn up by a committee, the composition of which was based on resolution No.  of  January  of the Ministry of Education, including representatives of the Ministry, representatives of all the educational authorities of the Republic, public officials from the Ministry of Economy, representatives of the public services and of the CTERA under the presidency of an official from the Ministry of Labour, who reported that the committee in question had been dissolved, without a resolution having been passed to this effect. Thus, argues the complainant, it can be concluded that the fundamental principles, including the ideal of concertation, which led to the creation of the committee, have been put to one side, thus leaving education workers deeply dissatisfied.
.The CTERA sent another communication dated  January  in which it fully endorses the complaint presented in the preceding communication.
.The ATE, in a communication dated  December , also criticises Decree No. / (sections , , , , , , ,  and ) which unashamedly violates the right of the organisation to negotiate freely the wages and employment conditions of its members. The complainant points out that the Government, far from attempting to ""encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation ... of collective agreements"" as stipulated in Article  of Convention No. , is ignoring the will of the social actors and is illegally and arbitrarily disregarding the workers' hard-earned social victories. There is a return to the old ways of authoritarian governments, although the Government is using more subtle methods, autocractically setting wage levels, thus depriving parties of any opportunity to undertake free negotiations.
.The WCL, in a communication dated  January , supports the complaint presented by the ATE and maintains that Decree No. / violates Conventions Nos.  and . Although it admits that the state reform aimed at increased rationality and efficiency is a common goal, there are ways, methods and safeguards which cannot and should not disregard the basic rights of workers and their organisations. If they are indeed disregarded, arbitrary acts run the risk of leading to inequality and aggravating social problems, including mass dismissals (even of trade union delegates), and of making the socio-economic situation even more difficult, possibly leading to instability and further acts of an arbitrary nature.
.In a further communication dated  February , the WCL provides information on the dismissal of trade union delegates who worked in the state sector. They are: Mr. Juan Carlos Piccini, Trustee (delegado normalizador, Institute of Social Works) whose mandate has expired, Mr. Jos Alverto Ibez, trade union secretary, Carlos Alberto Leonardi, press secretary and Jos Alberto Duarte, first secretary (National Register of Persons), Mr. Roberto Angel Pardo, press secretary (Public Work, Social Section), Mr. Hctor Ricardo Pieiro, Trustee (delegado normalizador), and Enrique Muzzio, Trustee (delegado normalizador, National Institute of Cinematography), Mr. Patricio Prassolo, general secretary, Eduardo Silva, trade union secretary and Favio Bruno, organisation secretary (Secretariat of Culture - Cervantes Theatre) and Mrs. Sandra Solari, organisation secretary (Under-Secretariat of Industry and Commerce). In its conclusion, the WCL describes these dismissals as attacks on trade union rights and requests the reinstatement of the delegates.
.The AAA in communications dated  December  and  February  reiterates and fully supports the comments made with regard to the terms of Decree No. / and its practical application in collective bargaining in the public sector.
.In a communication dated  August , the Government refers to Decree No.  and ruling No. / suspending the application of certain clauses of the collective agreements covering airline crew and points out that the grounds for the complaints presented by this sector no longer exist, since both the AAA and the Association of Airline Pilots (APLA - which is not a complainant in these cases) have concluded new collective agreements with their employer, Argentine Airlines SA (the former state-owned airline, Aerolineas) which have already been approved by the Ministry of Labour.
.The Government explains the factual and legal reasons which led to Decree No. / and points out that the Argentine Republic has, for some time, been experiencing a major economic crisis due to the enormous fiscal deficit which has been caused in part by the enormity of the public sector and by subsidies to state public enterprises. Against this background, Decree No. / was passed on  July  according to which, for a short-term period, and until new collective agreements are elaborated, the clauses of the collective agreements in force affecting productivity and efficiency will not be implemented. The state economic emergency was declared by means of Act No. , considering the emergency as a force majeure which could be applied to existing contracts concluded in the public sector.
.It was up to the Ministry of Labour to make a decision on the temporary period during which the clauses of the collective agreement suggested by the enterprise - in this particular case Argentine Airlines - were to be suspended. Consequently, ruling No. / was passed according to which some clauses of the collective agreement were suspended ""for a temporary period"". In this way, the suspension of the clauses of the collective agreement in question resulting from the decision is no more than the application of justifiable measures aimed at surviving the economic emergency.
.With this in mind, continues the Government, it is important to highlight that the procedure provided for in Act No.  on collective bargaining is not being waived at all and is in fact being fully exercised, in accordance with section  of Decree No. /. The suspension is merely for a short period, until a new agreement is concluded, and is fully justified in the light of anti-inflationary and stabilisation policies.
.On the other hand, the Government points out that the Supreme Court of Justice in the judgement ""SOENGAS, Hector Ricardo and others v. Argentine Railways"" of  August , has once again shown that, in situations of social or economic emergency, authority to regulate an individual's rights can be more forcefully wielded than in periods of calm and normality. It adds that the case could not have been resolved without a prior examination of the different clauses making up a collective agreement, such as those laying down employment conditions, responsibilities and the fixing of wage scales, which could have been rendered worthless as a consequence of high inflation or in the face of widespread crisis, and which, for this reason, have a bearing on economic order.
.The Government repeats that new collective agreements have now been signed between the airlines company and the complainant trade union organisation, and so the ruling and the application of Decree No. /, a product of the aforementioned economic crisis, were not enforced for very long in practice.
.Finally, the Government points out that, in the Argentine Republic, the division of powers existing in democratic systems is in force; judicial review of governmental actions or of the constitutionality of Acts and decrees is fully exercised when natural or juridical persons believe that their rights have been violated, thus leaving the final decision in the hands of the courts
.The Committee observes that the allegations presented in this case relate to the promulgation of Decree No. / which was based on the need to eliminate factors which may have a negative effect on efficiency and labour productivity in the public sector, in the framework of Act No.  on the economic emergency. Similarly, the allegations relate to restrictions or ""ceilings"" imposed by the Executive, on awarding pay increases by means of collective agreements. They also refer to the imposition of a fixed time period in which agreement must be reached once negotiations have begun and the measures the Executive may take to ensure efficiency and productivity in the event of an agreement not being reached. Reference is also made to section  of Decree No. / under which clauses of the agreements may be waived if they disrupt productivity, hinder or interfere with the administration of the enterprise, as in the case of clause  of collective agreement No. / which listed certain occupational categories represented by the APDFA before the Argentine Railways company, eroding the trade union's representative function.
.Other allegations presented in this case refer to certain administrative and legislative obstacles preventing the conclusion of a national collective agreement for the education sector for which a multipartite committee had been created to draw up legislation to uphold the national",-1,1990,Argentina
317,"agreement. The committee was allegedly dissolved unilaterally by the representative of the Ministry of Labour, without a resolution having been passed to this end, thus precluding a collective agreement for the sector. Furthermore, the Committee observes that other allegations relate to the dismissal of trade union delegates from among state employees, by virtue of the policy of rationalisation and efficiency. Their names are: Juan Carlos Piccini, Jos Alberto Ibez, Carlos Alberto Leonardi, Jos Alberto Duarte, Roberto Angel Pardo, Hctor Ricardo Pieiro, Enrique Muzzio, Patricio Prassolo, Eduardo Silva, Favio Bruno and Sandra Solari.
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government, particularly with regard to the economic crisis facing the country due, in part, to the size of the public sector and also to subsidies to state enterprises, which led to the promulgation of Decree No. . The Decree was aimed at reaching a level of efficiency and productivity which would allow the State to rationalise its operations and overcome the economic crisis facing it. It was purely a short-term measure to enable new collective agreements to be concluded in the public sector.
.The Committee notes furthermore that, by virtue of section  of Decree No. /, the State may waive certain clauses of collective agreements in force which affect productivity and efficiency, considering the state of emergency in the economy as a force majeure which may be applied to contracts in force in the public sector and which should remain in force until the conclusion of new collective agreements. It also notes that the Government states that Decree No. /, due to its short-term nature and its specific goals, does not override the machinery provided for in legislation normally governing collective bargaining but, on the contrary, allows it to function, in accordance with section  of the same Decree.
.On the other hand, the Committee notes that the Government emphasises that the final decision on the application of this Decree rests with the judiciary and that any person thus affected has recourse to legal processes.
.With regard to the measures taken by the Government with a view to rationalising the public sector in the framework of the state of economic emergency decreed by Act No. , the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that the exercise of prerogatives belonging to the public authority, with regard to financial matters, in such a way as to obstruct or amend the implementation or content of collective agreements previously negotiated by public bodies is incompatible with the principles of the freedom of collective bargaining. (See for example th Report, Case No.  (Canada/British Columbia), para. .) However, the Committee notes that Decree No. / states that the objectives of efficiency and labour productivity in public enterprises should be met within the legal framework in force, maintaining collective bargaining as the ideal means to govern labour activity, and that the suspension of certain clauses of collective agreements which have already been agreed, and which conflict with the aforementioned objectives, are of a temporary nature, that is to say, they last until the negotiation of a new collective agreement, but that negotiations must bring them into line with the Government's wage policy for the public administration (sections - of the Decree).
.In these circumstances, the Committee wishes to stress that even though voluntary collective bargaining is a key aspect of trade union rights, it has accepted that in certain circumstances for compelling reasons governments might decide that the economic situation in the country called for stabilising measures and that during the application of such measures it would not be possible for wage rates to be fixed freely through the process of collective bargaining. (See th Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (Uruguay), para. .)
.In this respect, the Committee, as well as the Committee of Experts and the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, have insisted that if within the context of a stabilisation policy a government may consider for compelling reasons that wage rates cannot be fixed freely by collective bargaining (in this case without exceeding certain ""ceilings""), such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standard. This principle is all the more important because successive restrictions may lead to a prolonged suspension of wage negotiations, which goes against the principle of encouraging voluntary collective negotiation.

.With regard to the specific allegations on the suspension of clause  of collective agreement No. / which listed categories represented by the APDFA within the Argentine Railways company, and to the alleged administrative and legislative obstacles preventing the conclusion of a national collective agreement for the education sector, the dissolution of the multipartite committee set up to draft legislation to this end, and also with regard to the dismissals of representatives of public sector staff mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Committee observes that the Government has not made any reply and requests that its comments be sent as soon as possible so that the Committee may be in a position to take a decision.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee, having observed the particular circumstances of the economic emergency facing the country and which have led to the restrictions on collective bargaining contained in Decree No. /, draws the Government's attention to the principle that has always been upheld according to which in cases of economic emergencies, such restrictions should only be applied for compelling reasons as an exceptional measure, only to the extent necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period and should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its comments on the allegations relating to the suspension of clause  of collective agreement No. /; on the administrative and legislative obstacles preventing the conclusion of a national collective agreement for the education sector and on the dismissal of representatives of public sector staff.",-1,1990,Argentina
318,".The Committee examined these cases at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see the th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st meeting in November ). The Confederation of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic (CTERA) furnished further information in a letter dated  January .
.The Government sent further observations in letters dated  January,  February and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the suspension of clause  of collective agreement No. / (ADEFA-Argentine Railways) by virtue of a Decree, the Committee notes the Government's statement that this measure is the subject of court action and that the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice is awaited in the matter. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the Court's ruling.
.As regards the allegation of administrative and legislative obstacles to collective bargaining in the education sector, the Committee notes with interest that a law on collective bargaining in this sector has recently been passed. The Committee further notes that notifications have been sent with a view to establishing bargaining commissions.
.Referring to the alleged dismissal of public sector staff representatives, the Committee notes that according to the Government three of the workers in question were not trade union representatives and that all the workers mentioned in the allegations were members of the administration working in a temporary capacity, appointed for a fixed and a predetermined period to cover the exceptional and temporary needs of the State. In these circumstances, since the complainants had given no details on the circumstances of the dismissals, the Committee considers that these allegations call for no further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the ruling of the High Court of Justice on the suspension of clause  of Collective Labour Agreement No. / (ADEFA-Argentine Railways) by virtue of a Decree.
.The allegations presented in this case against the Government of Argentina are contained in communications from the Association of Management Staff of Argentine Railways and the General Ports' Administration (APDFA) of  November  and January ; in communications from the Confederation of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic (CTERA) of  November  and  January ; in a letter from the Association of State Workers (ATE) of  December ; in communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) of  January and  February  and in communications from the Argentine Association of Airline Crew (AAA) of  December  and  February . The Government replied in a communication dated  August .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the APDFA alleges that Decree No. / of  July  (sections , , , , , , ,  and ) is undermining its right to undertake free negotiations with regard to the pay and working conditions of its members, thus violating the terms of Conventions Nos.  and .
.The APDFA points out that in September , Act No.  was promulgated, known as the Act respecting the Economic Emergency, and that section  thereof mentions a situation of collective danger arising out of the serious economic and social circumstances facing the nation. Section  of the Act authorises the Executive to review work regulations for staff in the public service or elsewhere, with a view to eliminating factors which could jeopardise efficiency and productivity. The same provision lays down that among other measures, summoning and/or creating collective bargaining machinery ... made it possible for joint agreements to be reached to carry out the provisions in this article. Thus, the possibility of unilateral decisions on the part of the Executive is reduced, since it is expressly stated that any possible ""review"" of the collective agreements must be done through a joint agreement. This is also laid down in section  of the Act.
.The complainant emphasises that Decree No. / continues the theme of the need to eliminate factors which may jeopardise efficiency and labour productivity in public enterprises, although the Decree emphasises that these very objectives must be met within the existing legal framework, keeping collective bargaining as a suitable instrument for governing the activity of workers. However, in spite of this affirmation, the Decree maintains that with a view to making the negotiating process easier, it has been deemed necessary to waive those clauses which conflict with the objectives of efficiency and productivity, until new agreements are reached.
.Furthermore, in Chapter III of the Decree (wages policy) employers' representatives on negotiating committees are deprived of any degree of flexibility with regard to wage agreements with trade union organisations. Wages have to fall in line with pay increases unilaterally decreed by the Executive for the public administration. So, indirectly, it is the Executive which determines remuneration for the sector of workers covered by collective agreements, thus precluding any negotiation except when an agreement is reached on granting wages below the ""ceiling"" (sections  to  of the Decree).
.The complainants go on to state that in Chapter IV (collective labour agreements) negotiations to renew the agreements may begin without delay (section ), which is quite acceptable. On the other hand, there are grounds for complaint in that there is an attempt to impose a fixed time-limit in which the collective agreement must be concluded. Otherwise, if an agreement is not reached, the national Executive will take steps to ensure that the terms laid down in section  of Act No.  are met.
.According to the APDFA, section  of Decree No. / contains the most blatant violation of the right of trade unions to engage in collective bargaining since, under the pretext of a ""short-term necessity"", clauses of the collective agreement are being openly waived when they supposedly ""disrupt productivity"", hinder or interfere with ""an enterprise's managerial and administrative capacity"".
.The complainant's communication concludes that the State is acting as both judge and jury in the following way: (a) the Government draws up its economic plan and determines adjustment policy; (b) government-appointed managers of public enterprises determine which clauses of the collective agreement conflict with ""efficiency and productivity""; (c) the trade union involved has five days in which to draw up pertinent ""comments"". A failure to do this is seen as ""consent""; (d) the Ministry of Labour and Social Security - an administrative department of the State itself - makes the final decision on waiving the terms of the collective agreement in question. In conclusion, the State determines economic policy; the State, as employer, puts forward amendments to collective agreements; and the State as administrative authority makes a decision on the possible ""comments"" drawn up by the trade union concerned.
.In a further communication of January , the APDFA refers to the practical application of Decree No. / with regard to certain collective agreements and in particular to collective agreement No. /, clause  of which, listing the occupational categories represented within the Argentine Railways company, has been suspended. The suspension was requested by the Acting President of the Technical Advisory Committee on Public Sector Wage Policy. The APDFA contested the request within the statutory five-day limit, but lost its case; it was ruled that clause  of the collective agreement should be suspended until new collective labour agreements had been approved.
.The APDFA's members are divided up according to categories. It represents the management and professional staff of Argentine Railways, of the General Port Administration and of the Institute of Social Services for Railway Staff. The application of Decree No. / to collective agreement No. / violates the principle of freedom of association, because in view of the APDFA being a trade union representing staff in different categories, and clause  specifying in the collective agreement which occupational categories the trade union represents at the level of collective bargaining, a suspension of this clause means that the representative function of the trade union is eroded.
.In its communication dated  November , the CTERA states that, on  August , its organisation requested the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to join it in elaborating a collective agreement for the sector, to provide a framework for arriving at agreements on wages, conditions and terms of work, how to reduce risks, and social and occupational benefits.
.The CTERA, when it formed part of a national preparatory committee along with provincial educational authorities, requested the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to develop the legal instruments for the formal constitution and functioning of a National Agreement for Education Workers. The Ministry of Labour's reply, through a legal ruling against the request, argued that a special",-1,1990,Argentina
319,"Act would need to be passed in Congress in order to set up a collective agreement for the education sector.
.The complainant adds that despite this ruling made by the Ministry of Labour itself, it has put obstacles in the way of the Bill on Collective Agreements for the Education Workers of the Argentine Republic and neglected to bring it before the Congress, thus barring its implementation, against the advice of the Ministry of Labour itself, in accordance with the judgements made by the General Directorate of Labour Relations.
.The complainant adds, moreover, that the Bill on Collective Agreements for Education Workers was drawn up by a committee, the composition of which was based on resolution No.  of  January  of the Ministry of Education, including representatives of the Ministry, representatives of all the educational authorities of the Republic, public officials from the Ministry of Economy, representatives of the public services and of the CTERA under the presidency of an official from the Ministry of Labour, who reported that the committee in question had been dissolved, without a resolution having been passed to this effect. Thus, argues the complainant, it can be concluded that the fundamental principles, including the ideal of concertation, which led to the creation of the committee, have been put to one side, thus leaving education workers deeply dissatisfied.
.The CTERA sent another communication dated  January  in which it fully endorses the complaint presented in the preceding communication.
.The ATE, in a communication dated  December , also criticises Decree No. / (sections , , , , , , ,  and ) which unashamedly violates the right of the organisation to negotiate freely the wages and employment conditions of its members. The complainant points out that the Government, far from attempting to ""encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation ... of collective agreements"" as stipulated in Article  of Convention No. , is ignoring the will of the social actors and is illegally and arbitrarily disregarding the workers' hard-earned social victories. There is a return to the old ways of authoritarian governments, although the Government is using more subtle methods, autocractically setting wage levels, thus depriving parties of any opportunity to undertake free negotiations.
.The WCL, in a communication dated  January , supports the complaint presented by the ATE and maintains that Decree No. / violates Conventions Nos.  and . Although it admits that the state reform aimed at increased rationality and efficiency is a common goal, there are ways, methods and safeguards which cannot and should not disregard the basic rights of workers and their organisations. If they are indeed disregarded, arbitrary acts run the risk of leading to inequality and aggravating social problems, including mass dismissals (even of trade union delegates), and of making the socio-economic situation even more difficult, possibly leading to instability and further acts of an arbitrary nature.
.In a further communication dated  February , the WCL provides information on the dismissal of trade union delegates who worked in the state sector. They are: Mr. Juan Carlos Piccini, Trustee (delegado normalizador, Institute of Social Works) whose mandate has expired, Mr. Jos Alverto Ibez, trade union secretary, Carlos Alberto Leonardi, press secretary and Jos Alberto Duarte, first secretary (National Register of Persons), Mr. Roberto Angel Pardo, press secretary (Public Work, Social Section), Mr. Hctor Ricardo Pieiro, Trustee (delegado normalizador), and Enrique Muzzio, Trustee (delegado normalizador, National Institute of Cinematography), Mr. Patricio Prassolo, general secretary, Eduardo Silva, trade union secretary and Favio Bruno, organisation secretary (Secretariat of Culture - Cervantes Theatre) and Mrs. Sandra Solari, organisation secretary (Under-Secretariat of Industry and Commerce). In its conclusion, the WCL describes these dismissals as attacks on trade union rights and requests the reinstatement of the delegates.
.The AAA in communications dated  December  and  February  reiterates and fully supports the comments made with regard to the terms of Decree No. / and its practical application in collective bargaining in the public sector.
.In a communication dated  August , the Government refers to Decree No.  and ruling No. / suspending the application of certain clauses of the collective agreements covering airline crew and points out that the grounds for the complaints presented by this sector no longer exist, since both the AAA and the Association of Airline Pilots (APLA - which is not a complainant in these cases) have concluded new collective agreements with their employer, Argentine Airlines SA (the former state-owned airline, Aerolineas) which have already been approved by the Ministry of Labour.
.The Government explains the factual and legal reasons which led to Decree No. / and points out that the Argentine Republic has, for some time, been experiencing a major economic crisis due to the enormous fiscal deficit which has been caused in part by the enormity of the public sector and by subsidies to state public enterprises. Against this background, Decree No. / was passed on  July  according to which, for a short-term period, and until new collective agreements are elaborated, the clauses of the collective agreements in force affecting productivity and efficiency will not be implemented. The state economic emergency was declared by means of Act No. , considering the emergency as a force majeure which could be applied to existing contracts concluded in the public sector.
.It was up to the Ministry of Labour to make a decision on the temporary period during which the clauses of the collective agreement suggested by the enterprise - in this particular case Argentine Airlines - were to be suspended. Consequently, ruling No. / was passed according to which some clauses of the collective agreement were suspended ""for a temporary period"". In this way, the suspension of the clauses of the collective agreement in question resulting from the decision is no more than the application of justifiable measures aimed at surviving the economic emergency.
.With this in mind, continues the Government, it is important to highlight that the procedure provided for in Act No.  on collective bargaining is not being waived at all and is in fact being fully exercised, in accordance with section  of Decree No. /. The suspension is merely for a short period, until a new agreement is concluded, and is fully justified in the light of anti-inflationary and stabilisation policies.
.On the other hand, the Government points out that the Supreme Court of Justice in the judgement ""SOENGAS, Hector Ricardo and others v. Argentine Railways"" of  August , has once again shown that, in situations of social or economic emergency, authority to regulate an individual's rights can be more forcefully wielded than in periods of calm and normality. It adds that the case could not have been resolved without a prior examination of the different clauses making up a collective agreement, such as those laying down employment conditions, responsibilities and the fixing of wage scales, which could have been rendered worthless as a consequence of high inflation or in the face of widespread crisis, and which, for this reason, have a bearing on economic order.
.The Government repeats that new collective agreements have now been signed between the airlines company and the complainant trade union organisation, and so the ruling and the application of Decree No. /, a product of the aforementioned economic crisis, were not enforced for very long in practice.
.Finally, the Government points out that, in the Argentine Republic, the division of powers existing in democratic systems is in force; judicial review of governmental actions or of the constitutionality of Acts and decrees is fully exercised when natural or juridical persons believe that their rights have been violated, thus leaving the final decision in the hands of the courts
.The Committee observes that the allegations presented in this case relate to the promulgation of Decree No. / which was based on the need to eliminate factors which may have a negative effect on efficiency and labour productivity in the public sector, in the framework of Act No.  on the economic emergency. Similarly, the allegations relate to restrictions or ""ceilings"" imposed by the Executive, on awarding pay increases by means of collective agreements. They also refer to the imposition of a fixed time period in which agreement must be reached once negotiations have begun and the measures the Executive may take to ensure efficiency and productivity in the event of an agreement not being reached. Reference is also made to section  of Decree No. / under which clauses of the agreements may be waived if they disrupt productivity, hinder or interfere with the administration of the enterprise, as in the case of clause  of collective agreement No. / which listed certain occupational categories represented by the APDFA before the Argentine Railways company, eroding the trade union's representative function.
.Other allegations presented in this case refer to certain administrative and legislative obstacles preventing the conclusion of a national collective agreement for the education sector for which a multipartite committee had been created to draw up legislation to uphold the national",-1,1990,Argentina
320,"agreement. The committee was allegedly dissolved unilaterally by the representative of the Ministry of Labour, without a resolution having been passed to this end, thus precluding a collective agreement for the sector. Furthermore, the Committee observes that other allegations relate to the dismissal of trade union delegates from among state employees, by virtue of the policy of rationalisation and efficiency. Their names are: Juan Carlos Piccini, Jos Alberto Ibez, Carlos Alberto Leonardi, Jos Alberto Duarte, Roberto Angel Pardo, Hctor Ricardo Pieiro, Enrique Muzzio, Patricio Prassolo, Eduardo Silva, Favio Bruno and Sandra Solari.
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government, particularly with regard to the economic crisis facing the country due, in part, to the size of the public sector and also to subsidies to state enterprises, which led to the promulgation of Decree No. . The Decree was aimed at reaching a level of efficiency and productivity which would allow the State to rationalise its operations and overcome the economic crisis facing it. It was purely a short-term measure to enable new collective agreements to be concluded in the public sector.
.The Committee notes furthermore that, by virtue of section  of Decree No. /, the State may waive certain clauses of collective agreements in force which affect productivity and efficiency, considering the state of emergency in the economy as a force majeure which may be applied to contracts in force in the public sector and which should remain in force until the conclusion of new collective agreements. It also notes that the Government states that Decree No. /, due to its short-term nature and its specific goals, does not override the machinery provided for in legislation normally governing collective bargaining but, on the contrary, allows it to function, in accordance with section  of the same Decree.
.On the other hand, the Committee notes that the Government emphasises that the final decision on the application of this Decree rests with the judiciary and that any person thus affected has recourse to legal processes.
.With regard to the measures taken by the Government with a view to rationalising the public sector in the framework of the state of economic emergency decreed by Act No. , the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that the exercise of prerogatives belonging to the public authority, with regard to financial matters, in such a way as to obstruct or amend the implementation or content of collective agreements previously negotiated by public bodies is incompatible with the principles of the freedom of collective bargaining. (See for example th Report, Case No.  (Canada/British Columbia), para. .) However, the Committee notes that Decree No. / states that the objectives of efficiency and labour productivity in public enterprises should be met within the legal framework in force, maintaining collective bargaining as the ideal means to govern labour activity, and that the suspension of certain clauses of collective agreements which have already been agreed, and which conflict with the aforementioned objectives, are of a temporary nature, that is to say, they last until the negotiation of a new collective agreement, but that negotiations must bring them into line with the Government's wage policy for the public administration (sections - of the Decree).
.In these circumstances, the Committee wishes to stress that even though voluntary collective bargaining is a key aspect of trade union rights, it has accepted that in certain circumstances for compelling reasons governments might decide that the economic situation in the country called for stabilising measures and that during the application of such measures it would not be possible for wage rates to be fixed freely through the process of collective bargaining. (See th Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (Uruguay), para. .)
.In this respect, the Committee, as well as the Committee of Experts and the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, have insisted that if within the context of a stabilisation policy a government may consider for compelling reasons that wage rates cannot be fixed freely by collective bargaining (in this case without exceeding certain ""ceilings""), such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standard. This principle is all the more important because successive restrictions may lead to a prolonged suspension of wage negotiations, which goes against the principle of encouraging voluntary collective negotiation. (Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, General Survey of the Committee of Experts, th Session of the International Labour Conference, , para.  and rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Chile), para. .)
.With regard to the specific allegations on the suspension of clause  of collective agreement No. / which listed categories represented by the APDFA within the Argentine Railways company, and to the alleged administrative and legislative obstacles preventing the conclusion of a national collective agreement for the education sector, the dissolution of the multipartite committee set up to draft legislation to this end, and also with regard to the dismissals of representatives of public sector staff mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Committee observes that the Government has not made any reply and requests that its comments be sent as soon as possible so that the Committee may be in a position to take a decision.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee, having observed the particular circumstances of the economic emergency facing the country and which have led to the restrictions on collective bargaining contained in Decree No. /, draws the Government's attention to the principle that has always been upheld according to which in cases of economic emergencies, such restrictions should only be applied for compelling reasons as an exceptional measure, only to the extent necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period and should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its comments on the allegations relating to the suspension of clause  of collective agreement No. /; on the administrative and legislative obstacles preventing the conclusion of a national collective agreement for the education sector and on the dismissal of representatives of public sector staff.",-1,1990,Argentina
321,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting of November  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )).
.Subsequently, the Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and  December . In the first communication, it pointed out that the complainant organization had not given sufficient details for it to be able to reply to the allegations pending concerning anti-trade union dismissals. The Office transmitted this communication to the complainant organization on  March , but no reply has been received to date.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the Committee examined this case at its meeting of November , the pending allegations concerned legislative provisions that allegedly violated Conventions Nos.  and ; excessive delays and red tape in the processing of union registration and to the granting of recognition, or refusal to do so, and the anti-trade union dismissals of the trade union leaders of associations of supervisory staff. In particular, the complainant organization challenged the following provisions of Act No.  respecting trade union associations dated  April  and its regulatory Decree No. /: sections  of the Act and  of the Regulations (number of dues-paying members required for an association that has not been granted recognition to take the place of an association covering the same area which has already been granted recognition), section  (prerequisites for an enterprise-level union to obtain the same recognition as unions covering a particular occupation, profession or category) and sections of the Act which grant exclusive rights to recognized organizations (representation of collective interests, collective bargaining, administration of social welfare activities, deductions from pay of trade union dues, tax exemption and trade union impunity for the representatives, etc.).
.The Committee made the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):- The Committee notes with satisfaction the Government's decision, communicated to an ILO expert mission which visited Argentina in August , to draw up as soon as possible, with ILO cooperation, draft amendments for submission to Congress so as to bring the legislation on trade union associations fully into line with the principles of freedom of association laid down in international labour standards. The Committee observes that the proposed new system in respect of trade union associations deals with the problem of supervisory staff associations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the reforms under way and trusts that in the near future it will be able to note major progress on the matters raised in the complaint and that, in the more immediate future, the Government will take measures to accelerate the processing of applications for trade union registration or the granting of recognition to trade union associations.- Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders of associations of supervisory staff.
.In its communication of  February , the Government stated that a priority objective was the search for faster procedures to facilitate the simple inscription and granting of legal recognition of trade unions covering a particular occupation, profession, category or enterprise. The Government announced that a Bill to amend the Act respecting trade union associations would be submitted to Congress, the drafting of which would include participation by an ILO expert mission.
.Concerning the allegations of dismissals of trade union officials of supervisory staff associations, the Government adds that, in order to reply, it needed the names of the enterprises in which these officials worked and the details of the administrative denunciations procedure followed in respect of these dismissals (which furthermore could be challenged in the courts).
.In its communication of  December , the Government transmits the Bill amending Act No.  respecting trade union associations submitted to the National Congress, which was prepared with the assistance of ILO experts. The Government adds that this Bill marks a significant step forward in the situation of the supervisory staff associations and encloses the following extract from the introductory part of the Bill:Section  of the trade union law in force establishes stricter conditions for the granting of recognition to unions covering a particular occupation, profession or category than those applicable to general unions. For these unions to obtain recognition, differentiated trade union interests must exist which justify the granting of such recognition, which in practice makes it difficult to establish horizontal trade unions. A criterion which is consonant with the principle of freedom of association leads us to conclude that this requirement is excessive when workers have freely decided that this is the type of union which is most suitable to their needs, and these reasons were taken into account in the Bill to derogate section . With this amendment the trade unions covering a particular occupation, profession or category will be able to enjoy freely trade union recognition.
.Finally, believing that the differences which might exist with the complainant organization have now been settled, the Government requests that this case should be now closed.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization has not provided the information required by the Government to be able to reply to the allegations concerning the dismissal of trade union officials of supervisory staff associations (names of the enterprises in which they worked, details of the administrative denunication procedure followed, etc.), although the Office wrote to the complaining organization on  March . In these circumstances, in view of the time which has elapsed, the Committee believes that these allegations require no further examination.
.As regards the allegations concerning the excessive delays and red tape in the processing of union registration and the granting of recognition, or refusal to do so, and the legislative provisions which allegedly violate Conventions Nos.  and , the Committee notes that a Bill has been presented to the National Congress to amend the Act respecting trade union associations and that it is a priority objective of the Government to establish faster procedures to facilitate trade union registration and the granting of most representative status to trade unions covering a particular occupation, profession or category, such as those represented by the complainant organization.
.In this respect, the Committee notes with interest that the Bill proposes the repeal or amendment of sections challenged by the complainant organization. Thus section  of the Bill provides for the repeal of section  of the Act respecting trade union associations (which set excessive conditions for the granting of most representative status to trade unions covering a particular occupation, profession or category), and section  amends section  of the Act (which stipulated that an organization not having the most representative status, in order to challenge the recognition granted to another association, had to have a ""considerably higher"" number of members). The Bill amends section  (which allowed only associations which had been granted recognition, but not those which were simply registered, to deduct trade union dues from pay) and section  (which exempted only associations with legal recognition, but not those which were simply registered, from taxes and levies).
.Despite these substantial improvements, the Committee observes that the Bill respecting trade union associations has not amended the excessive provisions in legislation for enterprise-level trade unions to obtain legal recognition (section  of the Act which provides that, in the same jurisdiction, there may be no other union operating in the area of activity or category covered). Furthermore, the Bill did not amend the provisions which grant privileges to trade union associations ""with legal recognition"" (in other words, the most representative associations which are allowed to bargain collectively) as regards the designation of staff representatives and internal commissions (sections  and (a)(ii) of the Act), and as regards trade union immunity (""fuero sindical"") (sections  and  of the Act which grant facilities to trade union leaders, and require judicial authorization for their dismissal or other prejudicial measures to which they may be subjected). The Committee trusts that the National Congress will take into account these comments, as well as those of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (see Report III (Part IVA), , examination of Argentina's application of Convention No. ), when it adopts the amendments to the Act respecting trade union associations and requests the Government to communicate them to the National Congress with a view to bringing the provisions of legislation fully into line with Conventions Nos.  and .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While noting with interest that major improvements have been brought through the Bill amending the Act on trade union associations, the Committee asks the Government to transmit to the National Congress its conclusions on certain omissions in the Bill which leave in force provisions of the Act regarding trade union associations which violate Conventions Nos.  and",0,1990,Argentina
322,", as mentioned in the preceding paragraph.(b) The Committee trusts that the National Congress will take its comments into account as well as those of the Committee of Experts and asks the Government to communicate them to the National Congress with a view to bringing the legislation fully into line with Conventions Nos.  and .
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Coordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Organisations dated  September . This organisation sent in further information in a letter dated  November . The Government furnished its observations in a letter dated  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its letters of  September and  November , the Coordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Organisations alleges that the Government has not met its obligations vis--vis the Coordinating Council that it entered into following the ILO's direct contacts mission in Buenos Aires in March  in connection with Cases Nos.  and  (in which the Coordinating Council was also a complainant) and which had been examined by the Committee at its meeting in May . Following the Government's undertakings at that time, the Coordinating Council had dropped the complaints when the Ministry of Labour set up a special commission with the aim of ""analysing the questions which gave rise to the complaints ... and proposing solutions ..."".
.Case No.  referred to Act No.  of  April  on trade union associations and to Decree No. / issuing regulations under that Act which, according to the complainant, contain provisions that are in violation of Conventions Nos.  and , such as sections  of the Act and  of the Decree (number of dues-paying members required for an association that has not been granted recognition to take the place of an association covering the same area which has already been granted recognition), section  (prerequisites for an enterprise-level union to obtain recognition), section  of the Act (conditions for the granting of recognition to unions covering a particular occupation, profession or category), and the sections of the Act that grant exclusive rights to recognised organisations (representation of collective interests, collective bargaining, administration of social welfare activities, deductions from pay (check-off) of trade union dues, tax exemption and trade union immunity for their representatives, etc.). In case No.  the complainant organisation had presented allegations concerning the enforcement of the Act in practice, denouncing the excessive delays and red tape in the processing of union registration and the granting of recognition, or refusal to do so, the failure to approve union by-laws ""adapted"" to the new Act on trade union associations, etc. (see th Report, Annex, para. ).
.The complainant adds that the ""special commission"" set up to study the above-mentioned issues has served only to enable the complaints of recognised organisations to be heard but not to resolve these complaints. Fourteen applications for recognition and  for union registration (some dating back five years) are still pending; in addition union leaders have been dismissed from organisations of supervisory and managerial staff in the public sector, such as HIPASAM, and in the private sector such as those of the Association of Supervisory and Managerial Staff of the Argentine Paper and Chemical Industry (which is in the process of acquiring recognition), Messrs. Botta, Deminotti, Albertini and Santilln.
.The complainant alleges further that section  of Decree No. / restricts collective bargaining by suspending the clauses in collective agreements which establish conditions of work that distort productivity or prevent or impede the normal exercise of managerial and administrative authority in state enterprises and companies, mixed economy companies or those in which the State has the major share and in any other entity in which the State is in the position of employer and the staff are at present governed by collective labour agreements. Among these clauses are those ""... which include managerial or supervisory staff within the scope of collective labour agreements"" (section (e) of the Decree). The exclusion, which for the time being is provisional and in line with the procedure established in the Decree in question, will be subject to negotiation by the joint committees on the relevant agreements, the Government's aim being to secure the definitive exclusion of this category of workers from the scope of collective agreements.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that the position of the complainant conflicts with what can be seen in the complaint, since it has adopted an extreme position - as seen from its unilateral breaking off of discussions on  June , when it abandoned the participative process for discussing the issues referred to in the complaint before the ""special commission"" set up on  March  (as a result of the direct contacts mission in March ), and from its idea that the administration should resolve the issues outstanding without settling the differences with the other sectors involved, thus distancing itself from procedural standards in respect of due process and the right of defence of all parties involved.
.The Government states that the the complainant's allegation concerning the refusal of the Ministry to register the organisations of supervisory and managerial staff and to grant them the recognition for which they have applied, is inaccurate. Although pressure of work on the administrative authority and in particular on the National Directorate of Trade Union Associations may cause delays in dealing with applications submitted to it, such delays affect all trade union associations dealing with this body and not only those of supervisory staff. Ministry of Labour records show that  trade union associations of supervisory staff have been registered and that recognition has been granted to  associations of this kind. In addition a number of other applications have already been processed by the above-mentioned Directorate and referred to the higher authority with the recommendation that the applications be granted.
.Furthermore there are many cases of associations of supervisory staff that have not responded to the observations made in respect of their proposed rules, and other cases of associations which, having adapted their rules, have failed to submit copies of them, all of which have prevented the relevant proceedings from coming to fruition.
.The Government adds that at the present time it is involved in a broad review of labour legislation in order to bring it into line with the changes that are taking place in the basic relations of the country's social and economic structure, which is being brought up to date. The standards to be revised include Act No.  which is to be not only modernised but also brought fully into line with the principles of freedom of association contained in international labour standards. To this end the Government recently requested the International Labour Organisation to cooperate with the Ministry in drafting the reforms that will be submitted to Congress. This resulted in an ILO expert mission visiting the country in August . The experts not only met the senior authorities of the Ministry but also members of the labour legislation committees of Congress and the President, Dr. Carlos Saul Menem. On all these occasions the authorities, and in particular the President, confirmed their intention of carrying out a complete overhaul of the legal system governing the institutional life of trade union associations. The expert mission undertook to continue cooperating on the draft reforms that would eventually be submitted to Congress. Under the new system it is planned to abolish any limitations on the setting up of new trade union associations, whatever their level or form of representation, so that they will be able to obtain recognition; craft and works unions and occupational associations will be able to register and to acquire recognition and all obstacles to the free exercise of trade union rights by such associations will be removed. To achieve this, and as stated by the President on the occasion of his meeting with the ILO experts, sections  and  of Act No.  are to be substantially amended. This will pave the way to the creation of a modern and efficient legal instrument which, drafted with the cooperation of the ILO and of the national sectors concerned, will be able to avoid the criticism to which the present text is subject; in addition trade union associations will enjoy the fullest facilities in respect of their constitution and freedom of operation.
.As regards Decree No. / which suspends clauses in collective labour agreements covering associations represented by the complainant organisation, the Government states that this provision does not apply solely to agreements covering supervisory staff, but that it is general in scope and applies to personnel of all kinds, including employees in state undertakings and bodies, whatever their position. But it should also be mentioned that this legislation was adopted because of the serious economic crisis which has prevailed in Argentina for a long time (partly as a result of the",0,1990,Argentina
323,"deficit caused, inter alia, by the oversized public sector) and which justifies an anti-inflation stabilisation policy. Furthermore, the Decree in question also aimed at administrative reorganisation since it was tantamount to a call for the renewal of collective labour agreements on which there had been no negotiations in recent years - despite Act No.  - and which were consequently completely out of date. As a result of these circumstances Decree No. /, until such time as new agreements had been worked out to replace those in force, gave the parties involved the possibility of provisionally suspending the clauses in collective agreements that dealt with productivity; failing agreement between the parties, the Ministry of Labour could decide on the period during which the said clauses were to be suspended. It should be pointed out that the system in question does not cancel out the procedure laid down in Act No.  but, on the contrary, promotes its application, as established in section  of Decree No. /. In addition, the suspension of clauses in collective agreements, as already stated, is merely provisional, and should end with the conclusion of a new collective agreement. Apart from this, the system for which Decree No. / makes provision not only imposes no restrictions on the freedom to bargain of the sectors representing supervisory staff, but aims particularly at promoting this freedom, like that of the blue-collar unions. Furthermore it must be stated that the complaint has now become pointless since a number of associations of supervisory staff have been convened to renegotiate their collective labour agreements with the relevant authority. Negotiations on the joint agreements are now in full swing and many of them having already been terminated with the signing of new texts which have all been duly approved (the Government has supplied a list of cases).
.As regards the alleged statutory limitations on the trade union rights of associations of supervisory staff and the delays in dealing with union registration and recognition, the Committee notes with satisfaction the Government's decision, communicated to an ILO expert mission which visited Argentina in August , to draw up as shortly as possible, with ILO cooperation, draft amendments for submission to Congress so as to bring the legislation on trade union associations fully into line with the principles of freedom of association established in international labour standards. The Committee observes that the new system in respect of trade union associations that is proposed deals with the problem which concerns associations of supervisory staff (abolition of any limitation on the forming of new trade union associations, whatever their level or form of representation, and their possibility to obtain recognition; facilities for registering and obtaining recognition for craft and works unions and occupational associations, sections  and  of Act No.  being amended accordingly). The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the reforms that are under way and trusts that in the near future it will be able to note major progress on these matters and that, in the more immediate future, the Government will take measures to remedy the delays which it has admitted in dealing with applications for union registration or the granting of recognition.
.As regards the alleged limitations on collective bargaining resulting from Decree No. /, the Committee notes the Government's observations and reiterates the principles that it formulated when examining Cases Nos.  and , examined elsewhere in this report, concerning the restrictions on collective bargaining in circumstances of economic emergency.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not answered the allegations concerning the dismissal of union leaders of associations of supervisory staff and requests it to furnish its observations thereon.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction the Government's decision, communicated to an ILO expert mission which visited Argentina in August , to draw up as soon as possible, with ILO cooperation, draft amendments for submission to Congress so as to bring the legislation on trade union associations fully into line with the principles of freedom of association laid down in international labour standards. The Committee observes that the new system in respect of trade union associations that is proposed deals with the problem which concerns associations of supervisory staff. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the reforms under way and trusts that in the near future it will be able to note major progress on the matters raised in the complaint and that, in the more immediate future, the Government will take measures to accelerate the processing of applications for union registration or the granting of recognition to trade union associations.(b) As regards the alleged limitations on collective bargaining resulting from Decree No. /, the Committee reiterates the principles that it formulated when examining Cases Nos.  and , examined elsewhere in this report, concerning the limitations on collective bargaining in circumstances of economic emergency.(c) Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders of associations of supervisory staff.",-1,1990,Argentina
324,".The Argentine Telephone Workers' and Employees' Federation - Buenos Aires Trade Union (FOETRA) submitted a complaint alleging violation of trade union rights in a communication of  April . In August  this organisation withdrew the complaint, stating that the problems which had given rise to it had been resolved. Subsequently, in a communication of  September  the organisation submitted a new complaint containing allegations that were substantially similar to those made in the previous complaint. The Government replied in a communication of  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Argentine Telephone Workers' and Employees' Federation (FOETRA) - Buenos Aires Trade Union, alleges in its communication of  April  that, in spite of an increase of  per cent in the cost of living in the first quarter of , remuneration in the telephone sector increased by only  per cent. In these circumstances, and in order to bring pressure to bear on the National Telecommunications Enterprise (ENTEL), a state enterprise, FOETRA called for a -hour nationwide strike on  April , while the Buenos Aires Trade Union called for a two-hour work stoppage per shift and occupation on  April . The Buenos Aires Trade Union was formally warned on  April  not to carry through with this action; the union challenged this warning in court but no decision has been issued. On  April  the Ministry of Labour issued resolution No. /, in which it proposed to file action in court to obtain the cancellation of the trade union status of the Buenos Aires Trade Union, and to denounce the probable commission of crimes specified in sections ,  and  of the Criminal Code.
.In August  FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union withdrew its complaint since the Ministry of Labour had decided not to pursue the cancellation of its trade union status, thereby removing the grounds for the complaint.
.In its communication of  September , FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union alleges that there has been no wage increase in spite of the fact that over five months have elapsed since it submitted its first complaint, and in addition, that the ENTEL enterprise had suspended overtime work; consequently, wages in August were lower than they had been in March. The workers' repeated demands have gone unheeded and the problems have begun anew. The Ministry of Labour has responded with warnings to workers not to engage in direct action, and has invoked the compulsory conciliation scheme provided for in Act No. . In this context, the enterprise offered a wage increase which, though it did not fully meet the expectations of workers, was expressly accepted by them; but, as incredible as it may seem, this offer was later withdrawn on the grounds that it had not been ""accepted"" by the Ministry of Economy, a development which could only add fuel to the dispute (it should be noted that part of this wage increase was paid, as had been agreed, so that there is little question that the wage increase was put into effect). The Ministry of Labour, for its part, declared ""illegal"" the workers' action of  August .
.It was in this context, the complainant organisation adds, that the Ministry of Labour issued resolution No.  of  August , which instructed the Ministry of Labour's legal department to file an action in court for the cancellation of the trade union status (or recognition) of FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union, in accordance with the provisions of section  of Act No. , and to file charges alleging the probable commission of the crimes specified in sections ,  and  of the Argentine Criminal Code. In addition, as part of the action to cancel recognition, the Ministry of Labour has requested the court temporarily to suspend the trade union's executive committee and to appoint an auditor. Moreover, the Ministry of Labour issued resolution No.  of  August  which: () temporarily and until the conclusion of the lawsuit suspends the trade union's registration, and () temporarily suspends its trade union rights and the collection of funds paid by employers as membership contributions on behalf of workers belonging to the trade union. According to the legislation, trade union registration automatically implies the acquisition of recognition (section  of Act No. ); therefore, the suspension of a trade union's registration automatically implies the suspension of its legal status, making it impossibile for it to carry out any trade union activity. It therefore implies the death of the trade union. Likewise, resolution No.  orders the suspension of the exercise of all rights arising from the trade union's legal status, even before the court has authorised such a measure.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that the dispute between FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union and the ENTEL enterprise was subject to the provisions of Act No.  on compulsory conciliation, and that the parties were therefore under the obligation to bargain during the period established by law. The FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union's decision to leave the bargaining table (which the trade union itself recognises) before the expiration of the period of conciliation, did serious harm to the community and must be qualified as imprudent and as clear evidence of disregard for the public interest. In the hypothetical situation that the parties had reached agreement, but that one of them had to submit the decision to another body, the time prescribed for negotiation would not be altered. The illegality of the strike, and the Ministry of Labour's declaration of the strike as illegal, does not concern the strike itself, but rather the timing of the strike, which took place during the period set aside for conciliation. In fact, section  of the above-mentioned Act clearly states that, once the period set aside for conciliation has expired without the resolution of the dispute or the acceptance of a compromise, both parties may resort to such measures of direct action as they see fit.
.In this context, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare issued resolution No. , dated  August, which, in accordance with section  of Act No. , instructed its legal department to file action in court for the cancellation of the trade union status of the complainant organisation; this measure takes immediate effect once the corresponding judicial complaint is filed, and the complaint was filed in, and is currently before the Fourth Chamber of the National Labour Appeals Court.
.The Government adds that contemporaneously with the filing of the above-mentioned legal action, on  August , the Ministry of Labour issued resolution No. /, ordering the temporary suspension of the complainant trade union's registration until the conclusion of legal proceedings. This administrative action is based on section  of Act No. , which empowers the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to register trade unions; section  of the same Act equates trade union registration with trade union status. In addition, section  of the Civil Code establishes that: ""The administrative decision concerning the withdrawal of trade union status or intervention shall give rise to the remedies provided for in section . The judge may order the temporary suspension of the resolution under appeal."" In this sense, it is unanimously accepted by legal experts in the country that the recognition of trade union status depends on an administrative action by the competent authority, in the executive or legislative branch; likewise, the withdrawal or cancellation of that status falls within the competence of the same authority responsible for granting it, without prejudice, of course, to the faculties of the judiciary branch. In this case, the Ministry of Labour merely suspended the complainant's trade union registration on a temporary basis, thereby fulfilling the supervision obligation which belongs to an administrative authority responsible for issuing or recognising an association's trade union status, through a preventive measure which, in the end, is subject to the decision of the courts.
.The Government states that the suspension of trade union registration does not imply a denial of the collective body's existence, citing the following commentary: ""A dissolved corporation may yet subsist, not as a legal person, but as a simple association lacking this attribute"" (see anotated Civil Code, Jorge Joaqun Llambias, Vol. , page ,  edition). Under the provisions of section  of the Civil Code, simple associations may function without the State's authorisation (ibid, page ), and may therefore acquire rights and contract obligations. It is therefore clear that the arguments submitted by the complainant to the effect that the suspension of trade union registration implies the death of the trade union, or that the administrative authority does not have the power to suspend such registration, are unfounded, since, as has been shown, the effects of the administrative action in question cannot have, and in practice have not had, such",0,1990,Argentina
325,"scope as to prevent the survival of the trade union organisation and the maintenance of its regular activities.
.In addition, the Government states that in spite of the untimely attitude adopted by the complainant organisation, the collective bargaining mentioned above continued with the national federation of telephone workers, and was ultimately concluded to everyone's satisfaction, thereby definitively resolving the differences between the parties. It should be added that the social concertation policy pursued by the national Government has led to the constitution of the Joint Bargaining Committee for the Collective Labour Agreement of Telephone Workers, which was set up to negotiate the agreement which would replace the agreement in force since , with the participation not only of the most representative trade union, but also that of nine new private enterprises which offer telephone services - the successors of the former National Telecommunications Enterprise. This negotiation recently reached a successful conclusion, resulting in the National Collective Labour Agreement for the telephone sector, which will govern the employment conditions of workers in this sector as from  May .
.The Government concludes by stating that this recent development shows that the complaint in this case has become abstract. On this basis, and in the light of the foregoing, the complaint is groundless and should be dismissed.
.The Committee notes that the complainant withdrew the complaint it had presented in its communication of  April . The Committee recalls that it has the authority to decide in this respect taking into account the circumstances of each particular case. In the present case, it accepts the withdrawal of the complaint as regarded the allegations in that communication. The Committee will thus confine its conclusions now to the allegations contained in the complainant's communication of  September .
.The case before the Committee can be summarised as follows: faced with the demands of FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union for a wage increase in view of the hyperinflation in the country, the National Telecommunications Enterprise offered a wage increase which was accepted by the workers, but was subsequently withdrawn when it was not accepted by the Ministry of the Economy; this led FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union to call a strike, even though the legally prescribed period for compulsory conciliation had not expired. The Ministry of Labour responded by issuing resolutions Nos.  and , of  and  August , respectively: the former ordered that the courts be requested to cancel the trade union status of FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union and the filing of charges alleging the probable commission of crimes specified in sections ,  and  of the Criminal Code (crimes against safety in transport and communications) and also requested as a preventive measure the temporary suspension of the trade union's executive committee and the appointment of an auditor; the latter temporarily and until the conclusion of the lawsuit suspended the trade union's registration and temporarily suspended its trade union rights, as well as the collection of funds paid by employers as membership dues or for other reasons on behalf of workers belonging to the trade union.
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to point out that, in accordance with the Committee's principles, telephone services can be considered essential services since their interruption may endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population; consequently, even stringent restrictions on the right to strike of workers in the sector, including the prohibition of the right to strike, could be admissible from the standpoint of the principles of freedom of association. Nevertheless, Argentinian legislation recognises the right to strike of time frames established for conciliation. In the present case, FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union failed to comply with these time frames, leading to a series of serious administrative sanctions (temporary suspension of trade union registration and trade union rights, including the right to withhold trade union dues at the source) and to the Ministry of Labour's request that the courts cancel the trade union status of the complainant organisation and its denunciation of the commission of possible crimes.
.In the Committee's opinion, the consequences of the Ministry of Labour's resolutions are excessively severe if one considers: () that the strike called by FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union followed the Ministry of the Economy's refusal to accept ENTEL's proposed wage increase for telephone workers in the context of national hyperinflation; and () that the Ministry of Labour's immediate reaction to the strikes, through ministerial resolution No. , seems to have brought these strikes to an end, and, in any case, they did not last long. The Committee considers that in these circumstances the Ministry should not have resorted to the most severe sanctions prescribed by legislation, such as the cancellation of trade union status, the suspension of trade union registration and the request that an auditor be appointed to replace the trade union's executive committee. In addition, the Committee considers that the administrative suspension of the trade union's registration (which is a requirement for its legal status) as well as of the trade union rights of FOETRA, is the de jure equivalent of the administrative suspension of FOETRA, and is contrary to Article  of Convention No. . The Committee also notes that although FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union retained de jure a minimum legal existence, as claimed by the Government, the national federation of telephone workers was able to continue the bargaining process, which culminated in a definitive solution to the collective dispute and led to the signing of a collective agreement which entered into force on  May .
.In the light of the specific details of this case, and in view of the fact that the collective dispute which led to the present complaint has been resolved, as well as the fact that the national federation of telephone workers has concluded a collective agreement, the Committee requests the Government, if this has not already been done, to lift the administrative sanctions against FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union and to withdraw the legal actions it has filed against this trade union and its leaders.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government, if this has not been already done, to lift the administrative suspension of the trade union's registration and to lift the suspension of the trade union rights arising from the special status of FOETRA - Buenos Aires Trade Union.(b) The Committee also requests the Government, if this has not already been done, to withdraw the legal actions it has filed in order to cancel the trade union status of this trade union and to withdraw the legal actions it has filed against its leaders.",-1,1990,Argentina
326,".The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights in Argentina presented by the Co-ordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Organisations (Case No. ), the Federation of Supervisory Staff Associations of State Enterprises (Case No. ), the Federation of Personnel of National Roads and Highways (Case No. ) and a representation made by the Industrial Union of Argentina under article  of the ILO Constitution, alleging non-observance by Argentina of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) (Case No. ).
.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the representation presented by virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The cases against the Government of Argentina pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association were originally presented by the Industrial Union of Argentina (UIA) in June , supported by the Argentine Chamber of Construction in July  (Case No. ), the Co-ordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Organisations (CEGJ) in June  (Case No. ) and May  (Case No. ), the Federation of Supervisory Staff Associations of State Enterprises in February  (Case No. ) and the Federation of Personnel of National Roads and Highways in October  (Case No. ). The Government sent its replies in respect of Cases Nos.  and  in communications dated April .
.In November , the Government requested the ILO to send a direct contacts mission ""to examine the issues raised"" by the complainant organisations in the representation and in the outstanding complaints, ""with the participation of the employers' and workers' organisations"". At its February  meeting the Committee proposed to examine Cases Nos. , ,  and  at its next May meeting in the light of the information obtained by the direct contacts mission (see th Report of the Committee, para. ).
.The Committee notes that the Mission took place from  to  March  and was conducted by Mr. Jos Vida Soria, former rector of the University of Granada, member of the Committee of Independent Experts of the European Social Charter (Council of Europe) and Professor of Labour Law, accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the ILO. The Committee notes with interest that the Mission conducted its work in a very cordial and co-operative atmosphere and was offered every facility, and wishes to thank Mr. Vida Soria for his detailed report on the issues raised in the various cases, following his interviews with Mr. Jorge Alberto Triaca, Minister of Labour and Social Security, and senior officials of the Ministry, and with representatives of the legislature, the judiciary, the CGT (Azopardo), the CGT (San Martn) and the complainant organisations. The Committee has taken due note of the Mission's report (see Annex).
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes from the Mission's report that, on its arrival in Buenos Aires, it was informed that a document had been signed on  March  in which the Industrial Union of Argentina called on the ILO to suspend proceedings with respect to the complaints it had presented (Case No. ), and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security undertook to support this request inasmuch as it was designed to make possible the direct settlement of the issues raised by the parties concerned (through a special joint committee), without prejudice to the right of the parties to inform the ILO of the outcome. Similarly, in a document signed on  March , the representatives of the Co-ordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Organisations stated that they were withdrawing the complaints submitted to the ILO (Cases Nos.  and ) and that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security had undertaken to set up a special committee to examine the issues raised in the complaints and to propose solutions.
.It will be recalled that Cases Nos.  and  refer to Act No.  of  April  on trade union associations and to Decree No. / issuing regulations under that Act, which - according to the complainant organisations - contain provisions that are in violation of Conventions Nos.  and . The allegations Case No.  relate to the implementation of the Act in practice and, in particular, to excessive delays and red tape in the processing of registration and recognition formalities, or the refusal to do so.
.It should also be recalled that the Committee's procedure contains a rule concerning withdrawal of complaints (see Digest of Decisions and Principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, third edition, , para. ) which states the following:When the Committee has been confronted with a request submitted to it for the withdrawal of a complaint, it has always considered that the desire expressed by an organisation which has submitted a complaint to withdraw this complaint constitutes an element of which full account should be taken, but it is not sufficient in itself for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed further with the case. In such cases, the Committee has decided that it alone is competent to evaluate in full freedom the reasons put forward to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to endeavour to establish whether these appear to be sufficiently plausible so that it may be concluded that the withdrawal is being made in full independence. In this connection, the Committee has noted that there might be cases on which the withdrawal of a complaint by the organisation presenting it was the result not of the fact that the complaint had become without purpose but of pressure exercised by the government against the complainants, the latter being threatened with an aggravation of the situation if they did not consent to this withdrawal.With regard to requests for the postponement or suspension of the examination of cases submitted by a complainant organisation or by the government concerned, the Committee's practice has been to decide in full freedom once the reasons given have been evaluated and bearing in mind the circumstances of the case.
.It is now for the Committee to decide on the requests for suspension of the proceedings and for withdrawal of the representation and complaints presented, respectively, by the Industrial Union of Argentina and by the Co-ordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Organisations. The Committee observes that the Government supports these requests and that, according to the Mission's report, they were made freely and without any kind of pressure. The Committee notes further that according to the documents signed by the complainant organisations and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which are given in full in the Mission's report, the parties decided to set up special committees to examine the issues raised in the complaints and to propose solutions.
.In these circumstances, the Committee decides to accede to the requests for suspension or withdrawal of the representation and complaints and welcomes the fact that the discussions among the parties concerned on the complaints and issues still pending before the Committee prior to the Mission's arrival have resulted in an agreement to settle the issues directly.
.The Committee further welcomes the fact that the agreements reached by the parties concerned include: () the setting up of a tripartite committee composed of representatives of the UIA and other bodies representing the employers' sector, as well as the workers represented by the CGT and the administrative authority for labour affairs, to examine the socio-economic and the labour situation and to consider current or future plans to amend the labour and social security legislation. This could mean, as the Mission's report indicates, ""... for the first time the country was deliberately embarking upon a course of negotiation and agreement with the social partners""; and () the undertaking of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to ""allow the participation of the Co-ordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Associations in the discussion of the issues affecting the institutions and staff it represents"". Finally, the Committee notes that the ministerial authorities told the Mission that they were optimistic that an agreement could be reached ""on the amendment of the regulations made under the Act whereby the points currently at issue might find a solution"".
.Allegations of the Federation of Personnel of National Roads and Highways
.Since the allegations of the Federation of Personnel of National Roads and Highways and the Government's reply are reproduced in full in the Mission's report annexed to the present report, the Committee wishes to draw attention to the relevant section of the Mission's report and will proceed directly to its conclusions on this case.
.The Committee's conclusions
.The allegations originate in a split within the Federation of Personnel of National Roads and Highways and refer to the interference of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in the internal functioning of the complainant Federation. Specifically, they refer to the suspension of the ordinary congress convened for  and  April , which elected a new",-1,1989,Argentina
327,"executive board, and the ministerial order declaring the April congress null and void and the Federation leaderless and appointing a ministry official as trustee (delegado normalizador), with instructions to convene a new congress to elect new officials and to appoint the Federation's delegates to the CGT Congress.
.In its reply the Government makes the following points: () in January  two congresses were convened representing conflicting factions which both claimed to be the Federation's legitimate representatives: the January congress of the section of the Federation which is the complainant in this case was convened by officials whose mandate was challenged by the other faction of the Federation; () the January congress of the complainant's section met without the statutory quorum; () given this confused, uncertain situation, the Ministry ordered the opposing parties to refrain from taking any action that might alter the existing situation, until such time as the organisation's internal problems were resolved, and accordingly ordered the suspension of the congress convened by the complainant's section for  and  April; () the April congress took place nevertheless and the Ministry therefore annulled it and declared the organisation leaderless and appointed a trustee.
.The Committee notes that, in a ruling handed down on  December , the National Labour Appeals Court revoked the ministerial decision ordering the suspension of the ordinary congress of April . It also notes that, in rulings handed down in December , the National Labour Court of First Instance () quashed the ministerial decision declaring the April congress null and void, the organisation leaderless and appointing a trustee and () ordered the reinstatement of the officials elected at the April congress. The Committee observes that neither of these rulings is as yet definitive since appeals have been lodged with the higher judicial authority.
.The Committee notes from the Mission's report that the complicated internal dispute that gave rise to this complaint has been compounded since the two January  congresses by a highly complex question of interpretation of the legal duration of the mandate of the Federation's executive board. The Committee notes further that, according to the Government, the January  congress of the complainant's section of the Federation met without the statutory quorum and that each faction contested the authority of the other. Whatever the facts of the matter and their correct juridical interpretation, the Government itself has stated that the executive powers of the complainant Federation's officials have now been fully restored, while the latter have informed the Mission that there is no longer any internal dispute as an agreement has been reached enlarging the executive board appointed at the April  congress in order to ensure representation of sections not present at the January  congress convened by the complainant's section of the Federation. Lastly, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities have handed down rulings which, though not yet definitive since they have been appealed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, are nevertheless in favour of the complainant Federation. The Committee observes that the Mission was informed by the ministerial authorities that the appeal is not directed against the present officials of the Federation but seeks a proper interpretation of the law as regards the scope of the powers of the Ministry in certain cases of internal conflict within a trade union organisation.
.In these circumstances, and since the situation of the complainant Federation has now been resolved both in fact and in law, it only remains for the Committee to request the Government to send it the text of the court's decision as regards the appeals lodged by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security concerning certain issues raised in the present case, in particular concerning the scope of the powers of the Ministry in certain cases of internal conflict within a trade union organisation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With respect to Cases Nos. ,  and , the Committee recommends that the Governing Body accept the requests of the complainant organisations to suspend its examination of Case No.  and to consider Cases Nos.  and  withdrawn, so that the complainant organisations and the competent authorities can settle the issues raised directly.(b) With respect to Case No. , noting that the internal conflict within the complainant Federation has now been resolved and that its officials may now fully exercise their functions, the Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the court's decision regarding the appeals that have been lodged in connection with certain aspects of this case.",-1,1989,Argentina

.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the representation presented by virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The cases against the Government of Argentina pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association were originally presented by the Industrial Union of Argentina (UIA) in June , supported by the Argentine Chamber of Construction in July  (Case No. ), the Co-ordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Organisations (CEGJ) in June  (Case No. ) and May  (Case No. ), the Federation of Supervisory Staff Associations of State Enterprises in February  (Case No. ) and the Federation of Personnel of National Roads and Highways in October  (Case No. ). The Government sent its replies in respect of Cases Nos.  and  in communications dated April .
.In November , the Government requested the ILO to send a direct contacts mission ""to examine the issues raised"" by the complainant organisations in the representation and in the outstanding complaints, ""with the participation of the employers' and workers' organisations"". At its February  meeting the Committee proposed to examine Cases Nos. , ,  and  at its next May meeting in the light of the information obtained by the direct contacts mission (see th Report of the Committee, para. ).
.The Committee notes that the Mission took place from  to  March  and was conducted by Mr. Jos Vida Soria, former rector of the University of Granada, member of the Committee of Independent Experts of the European Social Charter (Council of Europe) and Professor of Labour Law, accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the ILO. The Committee notes with interest that the Mission conducted its work in a very cordial and co-operative atmosphere and was offered every facility, and wishes to thank Mr. Vida Soria for his detailed report on the issues raised in the various cases, following his interviews with Mr. Jorge Alberto Triaca, Minister of Labour and Social Security, and senior officials of the Ministry, and with representatives of the legislature, the judiciary, the CGT (Azopardo), the CGT (San Martn) and the complainant organisations. The Committee has taken due note of the Mission's report (see Annex).
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes from the Mission's report that, on its arrival in Buenos Aires, it was informed that a document had been signed on  March  in which the Industrial Union of Argentina called on the ILO to suspend proceedings with respect to the complaints it had presented (Case No. ), and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security undertook to support this request inasmuch as it was designed to make possible the direct settlement of the issues raised by the parties concerned (through a special joint committee), without prejudice to the right of the parties to inform the ILO of the outcome. Similarly, in a document signed on  March , the representatives of the Co-ordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Organisations stated that they were withdrawing the complaints submitted to the ILO (Cases Nos.  and ) and that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security had undertaken to set up a special committee to examine the issues raised in the complaints and to propose solutions.
.It will be recalled that Cases Nos.  and  refer to Act No.  of  April  on trade union associations and to Decree No. / issuing regulations under that Act, which - according to the complainant organisations - contain provisions that are in violation of Conventions Nos.  and . The allegations Case No.  relate to the implementation of the Act in practice and, in particular, to excessive delays and red tape in the processing of registration and recognition formalities, or the refusal to do so.
.It should also be recalled that the Committee's procedure contains a rule concerning withdrawal of complaints (see Digest of Decisions and Principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, third edition, , para. ) which states the following:When the Committee has been confronted with a request submitted to it for the withdrawal of a complaint, it has always considered that the desire expressed by an organisation which has submitted a complaint to withdraw this complaint constitutes an element of which full account should be taken, but it is not sufficient in itself for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed further with the case. In such cases, the Committee has decided that it alone is competent to evaluate in full freedom the reasons put forward to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to endeavour to establish whether these appear to be sufficiently plausible so that it may be concluded that the withdrawal is being made in full independence. In this connection, the Committee has noted that there might be cases on which the withdrawal of a complaint by the organisation presenting it was the result not of the fact that the complaint had become without purpose but of pressure exercised by the government against the complainants, the latter being threatened with an aggravation of the situation if they did not consent to this withdrawal.With regard to requests for the postponement or suspension of the examination of cases submitted by a complainant organisation or by the government concerned, the Committee's practice has been to decide in full freedom once the reasons given have been evaluated and bearing in mind the circumstances of the case.
.It is now for the Committee to decide on the requests for suspension of the proceedings and for withdrawal of the representation and complaints presented, respectively, by the Industrial Union of Argentina and by the Co-ordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Organisations. The Committee observes that the Government supports these requests and that, according to the Mission's report, they were made freely and without any kind of pressure. The Committee notes further that according to the documents signed by the complainant organisations and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which are given in full in the Mission's report, the parties decided to set up special committees to examine the issues raised in the complaints and to propose solutions.
.In these circumstances, the Committee decides to accede to the requests for suspension or withdrawal of the representation and complaints and welcomes the fact that the discussions among the parties concerned on the complaints and issues still pending before the Committee prior to the Mission's arrival have resulted in an agreement to settle the issues directly.
.The Committee further welcomes the fact that the agreements reached by the parties concerned include: () the setting up of a tripartite committee composed of representatives of the UIA and other bodies representing the employers' sector, as well as the workers represented by the CGT and the administrative authority for labour affairs, to examine the socio-economic and the labour situation and to consider current or future plans to amend the labour and social security legislation. This could mean, as the Mission's report indicates, ""... for the first time the country was deliberately embarking upon a course of negotiation and agreement with the social partners""; and () the undertaking of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to ""allow the participation of the Co-ordinating Council of Supervisory Staff Associations in the discussion of the issues affecting the institutions and staff it represents"". Finally, the Committee notes that the ministerial authorities told the Mission that they were optimistic that an agreement could be reached ""on the amendment of the regulations made under the Act whereby the points currently at issue might find a solution"".
.Allegations of the Federation of Personnel of National Roads and Highways
.Since the allegations of the Federation of Personnel of National Roads and Highways and the Government's reply are reproduced in full in the Mission's report annexed to the present report, the Committee wishes to draw attention to the relevant section of the Mission's report and will proceed directly to its conclusions on this case.
.The Committee's conclusions
.The allegations originate in a split within the Federation of Personnel of National Roads and Highways and refer to the interference of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in the internal functioning of the complainant Federation. Specifically, they refer to the suspension of the ordinary congress convened for  and  April , which elected a new",-1,1989,Argentina
329,"executive board, and the ministerial order declaring the April congress null and void and the Federation leaderless and appointing a ministry official as trustee (delegado normalizador), with instructions to convene a new congress to elect new officials and to appoint the Federation's delegates to the CGT Congress.
.In its reply the Government makes the following points: () in January  two congresses were convened representing conflicting factions which both claimed to be the Federation's legitimate representatives: the January congress of the section of the Federation which is the complainant in this case was convened by officials whose mandate was challenged by the other faction of the Federation; () the January congress of the complainant's section met without the statutory quorum; () given this confused, uncertain situation, the Ministry ordered the opposing parties to refrain from taking any action that might alter the existing situation, until such time as the organisation's internal problems were resolved, and accordingly ordered the suspension of the congress convened by the complainant's section for  and  April; () the April congress took place nevertheless and the Ministry therefore annulled it and declared the organisation leaderless and appointed a trustee.
.The Committee notes that, in a ruling handed down on  December , the National Labour Appeals Court revoked the ministerial decision ordering the suspension of the ordinary congress of April . It also notes that, in rulings handed down in December , the National Labour Court of First Instance () quashed the ministerial decision declaring the April congress null and void, the organisation leaderless and appointing a trustee and () ordered the reinstatement of the officials elected at the April congress. The Committee observes that neither of these rulings is as yet definitive since appeals have been lodged with the higher judicial authority.
.The Committee notes from the Mission's report that the complicated internal dispute that gave rise to this complaint has been compounded since the two January  congresses by a highly complex question of interpretation of the legal duration of the mandate of the Federation's executive board. The Committee notes further that, according to the Government, the January  congress of the complainant's section of the Federation met without the statutory quorum and that each faction contested the authority of the other. Whatever the facts of the matter and their correct juridical interpretation, the Government itself has stated that the executive powers of the complainant Federation's officials have now been fully restored, while the latter have informed the Mission that there is no longer any internal dispute as an agreement has been reached enlarging the executive board appointed at the April  congress in order to ensure representation of sections not present at the January  congress convened by the complainant's section of the Federation. Lastly, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities have handed down rulings which, though not yet definitive since they have been appealed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, are nevertheless in favour of the complainant Federation. The Committee observes that the Mission was informed by the ministerial authorities that the appeal is not directed against the present officials of the Federation but seeks a proper interpretation of the law as regards the scope of the powers of the Ministry in certain cases of internal conflict within a trade union organisation.
.In these circumstances, and since the situation of the complainant Federation has now been resolved both in fact and in law, it only remains for the Committee to request the Government to send it the text of the court's decision as regards the appeals lodged by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security concerning certain issues raised in the present case, in particular concerning the scope of the powers of the Ministry in certain cases of internal conflict within a trade union organisation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With respect to Cases Nos. ,  and , the Committee recommends that the Governing Body accept the requests of the complainant organisations to suspend its examination of Case No.  and to consider Cases Nos.  and  withdrawn, so that the complainant organisations and the competent authorities can settle the issues raised directly.(b) With respect to Case No. , noting that the internal conflict within the complainant Federation has now been resolved and that its officials may now fully exercise their functions, the Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the court's decision regarding the appeals that have been lodged in connection with certain aspects of this case.",-1,1989,Argentina

334,".The Co-ordinating Council of Managerial Staff Organisations of the Republic of Argentina submitted a complaint in a communication dated  June , in which it alleged an infringement of trade union rights in Argentina. It provided additional information in support of its complaint on  July . The Government submitted its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the complainant organisation alleges that various aspects of the Bill on occupational associations, at present being examined by Parliament, infringe the principles, standards and international Conventions on freedom of association.
.The complainant organisation states that, although the Bill stipulates that trade union associations will be able to be set up freely without previous authorisation, it does not mention the possibility for managerial staff to set up or retain their own trade unions, as advocated by the Tripartite Meeting on Conditions of Work and Employment of Professional Workers organised by the ILO in November .
.The complainant organisation goes on to say that the existence of organisations of managerial staff, technicians and professional workers has been recognised in Argentina since . Subsequently, Act No.  of , supplemented by Decree No. /, established the right to set up occupational organisations by category of workers and Act No.  of , supplemented by Decree No. /, formally recognised the existence of organisations of managerial staff. This recognition therefore confirmed the existence of these organisations, of which the majority had been actively involved in trade union activities to defend their members and the community as a whole for more than  years.
.After defining what it understands by managerial staff, the complainant organisation concludes by demanding legislation to protect managerial staff within a specific trade union structure.
.In its communication of  July , the complainant organisation analyses the Bill which has already been passed by the Chamber of Deputies and is now before the Senate. It states that in the Executive's message to the Congress which accompanies the Bill, it is pointed out that ""the criterion in previous laws whereby the most representative trade union is in a privileged position is maintained, in accordance with a practice which is increasingly widespread at the international level"". According to the complainant organisation, the nature of this principle is changed by the paragraph which follows in the same message: ""This privilege granted to the most representative trade union does not entail a denial of the principle of trade union plurality because if the organisation which enjoys trade union status is no longer the most representative, this status is transferred to the organisation which has become the most representative."" In the complainant organisation's view, this principle is tantamount to stating that the Bill not only provides for the loss of this trade union status, but also provides for the transfer of the legal rights which accompany it to another organisation, even against the wishes of the managerial staff, thereby infringing their freedom of association. As far as the complainant organisation is concerned, the Bill thus establishes a single trade union system, which is an infringement of Convention No. .
.The complainant organisation also refers to sections ,  and  of the Bill which require certain formalities to be carried out for the formation of an organisation and which also stipulate that the administrative labour authority has  days to decide whether the organisation concerned may be registered as a mere trade union. However, this is only a preliminary stage in the granting of trade union status which is the final administrative step enabling an occupational organisation to operate fully. In fact, an organisation may only request trade union status six months after it has been registered as a simple trade union. According to the complainant, most of the formalities undertaken in connection with this request are subject to a subjective assessment by the authority responsible for the implementation of the legislation, namely the Ministry of Labour. The Ministry has a further -day period in which to reach a decision based, according to the complainant, not on the wishes of the workers to unionise but on a degree of representativity at a given point in time. In this way, explains the complainant organisation, trade union pluralism which corresponds exactly to the free choice of workers is impossible.
.The complainant organisation adds that for more than two years, some managerial staff organisations have had to cope with the disappearance of their files and the bureaucratic mentality of civil servants, who require formalities which are legally inexistent, thereby preventing these organisations from obtaining trade union status. According to the complainant, the fears it has about the Bill are not unfounded but are, on the contrary, corroborated by the fact that there is constant infringement of Conventions Nos.  and  as regards organisations of managerial staff.
.The complainant organisation also states that in the event of a failure to observe one of the formalities required to obtain trade union status, the administrative or judicial recognition will be considered null and void. According to the complainant, this is tantamount to acknowledging that the administrative authority has priority over the judicial authority, which in its view is an infringement of the national Constitution.
.This concept may be found, according to the complainant organisation, throughout the Bill as a whole. For instance, section  enables the administrative authority to place a trade union association under supervision without a prior legal ruling; similarly, section  enables a confederation or federation to place a lower-level organisation under its supervision. In the complainant organisation's view, this shows the interventionist nature of the Bill, which is contrary to ILO Conventions and to internationally accepted and acknowledged law and practice.
.In concluding, the complainant states that in view of the unfortunate experiences which the organisations of managerial staff have had to face and the fact that even under Act No.  their representativity was reduced by a Ministerial Resolution, their fears and uneasiness as to the Bill are justified. It is not the first time, it points out, that the legitimate growth of organisations of managerial staff is prevented by a Bill.
.In its reply, the Government states firstly that the Bill on trade union associations of workers sets out precisely to promote freedom of association.
.The Government explains that the provisions already approved by the Chamber of Deputies and at present before the Senate do not in any way affect the legitimate interests of the trade union associations of managerial staff. This argument is not called into question by the lack of a standard in the Bill similar to that contained in Act No.  mentioned by the complainant. In fact, the Government notes that this provision infringed freedom of association by banning the joint trade union membership of managerial staff and other workers.
.The Government adds that section  b)of the Bill provides, in the same way as the previous Acts mentioned by the complainant, for the existence of trade union organisations of workers in the same trade, occupation or category, amongst which managerial staff may be included.
.The Government quotes a series of provisions which clearly protect freedom of association. It points out that the chapter on the duties of the authority responsible for the Bill's implementation defines the powers of intervention of this authority (section ). The administrative authority is in fact obliged to apply to the Judiciary when requesting that the trade union status of an organisation be suspended or cancelled or that the organisation be placed under supervision (section ). Furthermore, an appeal to the courts may be lodged against any administrative ruling (section ).
.In the Government's view, the complainant's arguments that the Bill would promote a single-trade-union system are also unfounded because the formalities required for the setting up and registration of trade unions are only of a formal nature. The time period allowed the administrative labour authority to examine the case before registration ( days) seems reasonable, given the mass of administrative tasks the labour administration has to fulfil. Furthermore, at the end of this period, the organisation concerned may bring an appeal before the Labour Court, on the grounds of a tacit refusal to register (section (c)).
.The Government also stresses that under section  of the Bill, the registration of a trade union association automatically confers on it legal personality and rights, such as the right to make claims on behalf of its members and to represent them, to represent the collective interests of the branch of activity or category of workers, to collect dues or subscriptions from its members and to organise meetings or assemblies without the need for previous authorisation.
.Finally, as regards the exclusive rights granted to trade unions having trade union status, the Government states that the provisions of the Bill do not deprive organisations which are merely registered of their general rights. On this point, the Government refers to the decisions of",0,1987,Argentina
335,"the Committee on Freedom of Association in this respect and to national systems which grant privileges to the most representative trade union.
.Lastly, the Government considers that the Bill in question does not contain provisions violating freedom of association and that consequently the complaint is not founded.
.The Committee notes that the complaint of the Co-ordinating Council of Managerial Staff Organisations of the Argentine Republic centres on the new Bill on trade union associations of workers submitted by the Government to Congress. The complainant organisation alleges that the Bill does not specifically provide for the possibility of setting up managerial staff organisations, contrary to the Act previously in force. It criticises the procedure established for the registration of trade unions which, in its view, is too slow, and the excessive powers which will be vested in the administrative authority, in this case the Ministry of Labour. Finally, the complainant organisation considers that the system of exclusive privileges granted to the most representative organisation prevents trade union pluralism.
.The Committee notes that the Bill in question does not contain any provision specifically providing for the possibility of establishing organisations exclusively representing managerial staff. However, section  of the Bill stipulates that there may be organisations comprised of workers in the same trade, occupation and category, even if they are employed in different branches of activity. It therefore seems clear that under this section, organisations of managerial staff may be set up and function. Moreover, the Committee is bound to point out that the provision of the previous Act to which the complainant organisation refers has been subject to comments by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and this Committee itself because, although it specifically provided for the establishment of managerial staff organisations, it did not allow such staff to join the same organisations as other workers (see st Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. ). The Committee therefore considers that the provision of section  of the Bill, which is drawn up in a such a way that managerial staff may either set up their own organisations or join workers' organisations in general, is a step forward compared with the previous legislation.
.As regards the formalities required for setting up organisations, the Committee points out that under section  of the Bill, the administrative labour authority must register an organisation which meets the necessary requirements (filing its rules, together with its name, list of officials and members, etc.) within  days. Under sections  and , an appeal against administrative decisions may be brought before the courts, in this instance the National Labour Appeal Court.
.To be able to decide whether these provisions are compatible with principles of freedom of association, the Committee must determine whether the formalities required are tantamount to prior authorisation from the authorities or not. In view of the fact that the nature of the formalities and the time period for reaching an administrative decision are reasonable and that there is a possibility of appealing to the courts, the Committee considers that the requirements of the Bill with respect to the setting up of organisations do not infringe the principles of freedom of association.
.Finally, concerning the privileges granted to the most representative trade union, the Committee notes that such an organisation is given ""trade union status"", which is accompanied by several exclusive rights, in particular, to take part in collective bargaining (section  of the Bill). An association with ""trade union status"" must be entered in the trade union register, have been operating for more than six months and be comprised of more than  per cent of the workers it aspires to represent. The association selected must have the greatest number of subscribing members out of the average number of workers qualified for membership, the average being calculated over the six months prior to the request (section ). On the other hand, organisations which do not have ""trade union status"" may represent the individual interests of their members and collective interests when there are no organisations with trade union status in the same branch of activity or category (section ).
.On several occasions in the past the Committee has been called on to take a decision on systems of this nature. It has pointed out that during the discussion on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, the International Labour Conference raised the matter of the representativity of trade unions and accepted that there might be, to a certain extent, a distinction between the various trade unions, depending upon their level of representativity. Article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the ILO also accepts the concept of the ""most representative"" industrial organisations. Consequently, the Committee has considered that the mere fact that the law of a country draws a distinction between the most representative trade union organisations and other trade union organisations is not in itself a matter for criticism. However, this is provided that such a distinction does not accord to the most representative organisation privileges extending beyond the privilege of priority, on the ground of its having the largest membership, in representation for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words, this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organisations that are not recognised as being among the most representative of the essential means whereby they may defend the occupational interests of their members, organise their administration and activities and formulate their programmes, as provided for in Convention No.  (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (India), para. ).
.In the present case, it would seem that the criteria set out above are respected in the Bill since the most representative organisation is determined according to objective and pre-established criteria (the greatest number of members) and the minority trade unions are able to represent the individual interests of their members. The Committee hopes that, on this basis, managerial staff may be represented in the collective bargaining process by the organisation which the majority of them has chosen.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee hopes that, on the basis of the criterion set out in the Bill for determining the most representative trade union, managerial staff may be represented in the collective bargaining process by the organisation which the majority of them has chosen.b) The Committee draws this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",4,1987,Argentina
336,".In a communication of  July l, the Union of Argentinian Teachers (UDA) filed a complaint against the Government of Argentina in connection with an executive Act that dissolved the Supplementary Old-age and Pension Fund for Teaching Personnel, which the Union had hitherto administered. It sent additional information in communications of  August l,  March l,  January l and  April l.
.For its part, the Government then in power sent its observations on the matter in communications dated  October and  November l. The new Government sent its observations in communications of  October l,  and l February l, l August l and  May .
.The parties had notified the ILO on several occasions that the whole issue was being examined by the judicial authorities and had forwarded copies of judgements that had been handed down.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, l (No.), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, l (No.).
.In its complaint, the UDA, which claims to represent all members of the teaching profession in Argentina, recalls that the Supplementary Old-age and Pension Fund for Teaching Personnel was set up by a corporate co-responsibility agreement of  May l between the complainant organisation and the Ministry of Culture and Education, in its capacity as employer, in application of Act No.  of  February l. The Fund operated for more than seven years under the administration and management of the UDA. In an accompanying note outlining the ups and downs of the Fund during that period, the complainant refers to instances of harassment and administrative mismanagement since  that eventually ended with its dissolution by Act No.  of  May .
.According to legal documents concerning the Fund's by-laws, forwarded by the complainant organisation, the central office of the Ministry of Culture and Education was authorised to withhold  per cent of teachers' salaries as their contributions to the Fund (Resolution No.  of  July l) which was empowered to receive contributions from any source provided they were used only for the purposes stipulated in its by-laws, in other words as supplementary old-age and pension benefits. The Fund was managed by a six-member Board appointed by the UDA, while two representatives of the administrations involved acted as public trustees.
.Section  of Executive Act No.  annulled the corporate co-responsibility agreement of  May l and thereby dissolved the Fund, confiscating its assets and incorporating them into a National Supplementary Fund for Teaching and Non-Teaching Personnel, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. The Act sets out all the administrative and management details of the new Fund which is run by a nine-member Board, three of whom are appointed by the Ministry of Education and six by the Fund's members.
.The complainant organisation strongly protested these legislative provisions, especially as they were followed by repressive measures against the trade union that was holding the Fund's assets. On  May l, military forces occupied the Fund's premises and the military authorities appropriated its assets, as evidenced by a notary's official report. Following these events, the Fund's president commenced proceedings to recover the confiscated assets which were successful in the court of first instance, which approved the request, although its decision was later overturned on appeal when a higher court upheld the military take-over of the Fund. The assets therefore remained in the hands of the Minister of Education who entrusted them to a new Board which he appointed.
.In its communication of  August l, the complainant states that, with the exception of section , Act No.  is governed by Decree No. ll, that the military authorities continue to occupy the Fund's premises, that the judge examining the challenge to the constitutionality of section  had ordered the assets to be frozen but that his decision had not been respected by the administrative authorities.
.Moreover, the complainant alleges that in order to consolidate the situation the Minister of Education called elections for the new Board which the judge ordered suspended at the request of trade union organisations. Furthermore, the UDA declares that the court ruled in its favour on the question of the constitutionality of section  of Act No. , but that it has been unable to obtain the enforcement of this decision and the application of the corporate co-responsibility agreement of  May  by the administrative authorities involved. Subsequently, on l August l, the complainants attempted to recover their assets but were prevented from doing so by the police. The UDA alleges that the case involves a violation of Convention No.  and requests the Committee to send a representative to Buenos Aires to investigate the facts and intercede with the Government of Argentina.
.In a communication of  January l, the UDA states that no legal action has been taken regarding the constitutionality of Act No.  and that the recently elected democratic Government has so far failed to keep its promise to redress the damages caused by the Act adopted by the military Government; thus, the situation remains at an impasse. The trade union organisation adds that the take-over of the Fund managed by the UDA has restricted the union's retired teaching personnel programme as a result of the confiscation of assets estimated at $ million.
.In a more recent letter dated l April l, the complainant indicates that its claim was dismissed by local judges for defects in form on account of legal flaws but that no opinion was expressed on its substance; the complainant then filed a law suit before a federal administrative disputes court, requesting its intervention at the ILO on grounds of non-compliance with Convention No.  (Article ), but no action had been taken on this request.
.In its several communications, the Government in power at the time the challenged Act was adopted did not explain why it had taken drastic action in respect of the Supplementary Fund for Teaching Personnel. The information furnished in its letter of l October l concerned the legal proceedings initiated by the complainant organisation. Upon appeal, the administrative disputes court revoked the decision of the court of first instance and ordered the Executive to suspend section  of Act No. . In other proceedings challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Act, the court prudently ordered the ""suspension of the distribution of funds and assets belonging to the dissolved fund"". The Government also noted that at the UDA's request the judge had annulled the elections to the Board of the Supplementary Fund, on the grounds that they would have entailed the implementation of section . The Government noted that the courts had examined the substance of the case and rendered judgement on the intrinsic merits of the administrative decision, but that the Ministry of Culture and Education had appealed the decisions handed down by the courts. Moreover, in the same communication the Government stressed that the UDA had not been prevented from advancing its claims and protecting its interests before the judicial authorities and that the Act had even been suspended until all legal appeals had been exhausted and a final ruling not subject to appeal had been handed down.
.On  October l, the new Government submitted its observations on the case, suggesting that no action be taken until the courts handling the matter had rendered their decisions. The Government reiterated this request in communications dated  and l February l and l August l.
.The Government sent to the Committee a further communication, dated  May , concerning the judicial proceedings under way. It states that in the case brought by the dissolved Supplementary Fund against the State before the National Judge of First Instance (Federal Administrative Case No. ), the Union of Argentinian Teachers (UDA) has been accepted, at the request of the Fund, as a third party having an interest in the case.
.This complaint involves the dissolution by Act No.  of  May l, adopted by the former military Government, of the Supplementary Old-age and Pension Fund for Teaching Personnel, hitherto administered by the complainant organisation, the UDA, under a draft agreement with the Ministry of Culture and Education dated  May l.
.The Committee notes that the complainant employed all available legal means to defend and enforce its rights and interests, obtaining a stay in the enforcement of the Act and blocking the fund's financial assets.
.The Committee recalls that in a previous case (rd Report, Case No. lll, para. ()) it had considered that it should not express opinions as to the desirability of entrusting the administration of social insurance and the supervision of social legislation to occupational associations rather than to administrative state organs, except in so far as such a measure might restrict the free exercise of trade union rights. In the present case, in the light of the elements taken into consideration, the Committee has not found conclusive evidence of any restriction on the exercise of the rights of the UDA or of any interference",5,1983,Argentina
337,"whatsoever by the administrative authorities in its management and trade union activities.
.The Committee notes that neither the legal situation that gave rise to the complaint, namely the enactment of legislation that replaced the UDA trade union as administrator and manager of the Supplementary Old-age and Pension Fund for Teaching Personnel, nor the events that took place under the former military regime, namely the occupation of the Fund's premises by military forces and the confiscation of its assets, relate to trade union activities that come within the terms of the reference of the Committee, given the fact that no trade union premises or trade union assets are involved. The Committee considers that while the administration and management of a provident fund may fall within the competence of a trade union by virtue of an agreement with the Government, they are not part of its trade union activities as such but fall within the province of the social security or welfare schemes. Furthermore, the Committee notes that the new Act does not exclude teaching personnel from the management and administration of the new Fund, since six of the nine members of the Board are elected by the Fund's members, who are thus still represented. In the Committee's opinion, the assets which a pension fund may derive from social welfare contributions deducted from salaries cannot be looked upon as trade union funds.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee considers that the disputed assets of the former Supplementary Fund are social welfare contributions and therefore not trade union funds.b) The Committee considers that this case does not fall within its terms of reference and that it therefore does not call for further examination.",4,1983,Argentina
338,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) presented complaints of violation of trade union rights in Argentina in communications dated  March and  April , respectively. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU states in its complaint that almost all the members of the executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) were arrested on  March  because of a peaceful demonstration which they had intended to organise at the Plaza de Mayo, where the palace of the President of the Republic is situated, to protest against the restrictions on freedom of association, inflation and unemployment and in favour of better wage conditions.
.According to the ICFTU, the police hampered the demonstration by arresting the CGT leaders and a considerable number of demonstrators.
.The WCL expresses its concern over these incidents. It adds that even if the leaders and active trade unionists have been released, a whole range of restrictions will certainly continue to affect the workers' trade union organisation and restrict the full exercise of trade union activities.
.The Government explains that ""the movement which is called the CGT"" decided to organise a public meeting on  March  in the Plaza de Mayo without requesting the police authorisation required by Act No. . of  January . Under the terms of this Act, such advance authorisation is in fact required for the holding of meetings in public places or places which are usually open to the public.
.According to the Government, the aims of the meeting were extra-occupational, the proof of which being that the organisers had been trying to arrive at an agreement with certain political groupings. The Government points out that the majority wing of trade unionism within the National Labour Commission (CNT) and the """" ignored the call for a demonstration. Even within the CGT certain currents were against it. After the  March announcement that a demonstration was being organised, the Ministry of the Interior released a statement, which was widely disseminated, recalling that the state of siege was still in force and that Act No. . regulated freedom of assembly.
.In addition, the Government states that it was announced that since such meetings could be used to attack public security and order, the necessary measures would be taken to guarantee the strict application of the legislation in force and to safeguard social peace. A few days beforehand the organisers had in fact announced publicly their decision not to request authorisation.
.Consequently, the Government took certain security measures to maintain the calm of the population which had largely not responded to or supported the call for a meeting. According to the Government, police and security forces were restricted to ensuring order and the normal carrying out of activities in the country.
.Some incidents did take place as a result of the intemperance of the organisers who would not renounce their wish to upset the social peace. Therefore some arrests had to be made. Ir. the majority of cases, after identity checks, those concerned were immediately released;  persons were detained for disobeying an order to disperse given by the police; this should entail a punishment of five days' detention. They were finally freed, on the Government's orders, after  hours.
.The Committee notes the Government's observations, in particular that the CGT had not requested previous authorisation to organise a public demonstration for  March .
.In this regard, the Committee must recall that, if the organisers must respect the general provisions relating to meetings in public places which apply to everyone, this principle being also set out in Article  of Convention No.  according to which workers and their organisations must respect the law of the land, the right to hold trade union meetings is an essential element of freedom of association.
.However, in the present case, the Committee must note that the restrictions imposed in the country on trade union organisation in general - and in particular on Confederations, especially the CGT - have not been lifted by the terms of Act No. . of November  and consequently are liable to lead to situations of conflict such as the subject of the complaints. As the CGT has not in fact been recognised by the Government, it had an even greater reason not to be able to obtain authorisation to organise public demonstrations for the purpose of making its claims known. Such a situation can therefore only help in dissuading it from requesting the necessary authorisation.
.As regards the arrests carried out during the meeting, the Committee notes that the persons concerned have been released.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee recalls that if trade union organisations must respect the general provisions relating to meetings in public places which apply to everyone, the right to hold trade union meetings is an essential element of freedom of association.(b) However, it notes that the restrictions imposed on trade union organisations and particularly Confederations are liable to lead to situations of conflict such as the subject of these complaints.(c) The Committee notes the release of the persons arrested during the demonstration.",-1,1982,Argentina
339,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint of violation of trade union rights in Argentina in a letter dated  March . The Government sent its observations in a communication of  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint the ICFTU alleges that through the presence of the police the authorities tried to prevent the holding of a meeting of the general secretaries of member organisations of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). it explains that, on  February , policemen from Central Police Stations Nos.  and  - six in total - took up positions in front of the CGT headquarters while more than a dozen uniformed policemen patrolled the area and others out of uniform remained in cars without number plates.
.According to the ICFTU, the Government's intention was clear since, shortly after midday, the superintendent of Station No.  met with the CGT leaders and told them that restrictions on trade union activities were in force. Lastly, the ICFTU considers that these facts constitute interference by the authorities in trade union affairs which is contrary to Article  of Convention No. .
.In its reply the Government states that the presence of police strength on  February  was part of the institutional mission of the police force under the provisions of Act No. . on the right of assembly. The Government notes that the policemen were carrying out a routine task and that they used no dissuasive measures on participants in the meeting. On the contrary, it was the trade union leaders themselves who took advantage of the police presence to sow doubt in certain uninformed sectors, including the international fora.
.No restrictions or obstacles were placed before the meeting. Moreover, according to the Government, the trade union leader Saul Ubaldini stated in the daily newspaper ""La Nacin"" on  February  that the police had not prohibited the meeting. Therefore, if the meeting was unable to be held, it was purely due to a voluntary and spontaneous decision of the participants. The CGT meeting did in fact take place two days later and the police authorities did not adopt any measures which might have impeded it despite the standards in force which limit certain political and trade union activities.
.It appears from the information supplied by the complainant and the Government that police forces took up positions around the CGT headquarters when a meeting of CGT leaders was to take place. However, it does not appear that the police directly intervened to prevent the meeting taking place as it eventually was held two days later.
.The Committee notes that the meeting was organised on trade union premises and that accordingly there seemed to be no need to fear public disturbances. Moreover, the Committee considers that the simple presence of police in front of the CGT headquarters could in itself constitute an element of dissuasion for the trade union leaders who were to meet there. The Committee therefore considers it useful to draw the Government's attention to the fact that freedom of trade union assembly is fundamental to trade union rights and that the authorities ought to refrain from any intervention of such a nature as to restrict this right or hinder the legal exercise of it.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, draw the Government's attention to the fact that freedom of trade union assembly is fundamental to trade union rights and that the authorities ought to refrain from any intervention of such a nature as to restrict this right or hinder the legal exercise of it.",-1,1982,Argentina
340,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) presented complaints regarding the violation of trade union rights in Argentina in telegrams dated respectively  and  July . The ICFTU sent additional information in a letter dated  August . The Government forwarded its observations in a letter dated  August  and in a further communication received at the ILO on  November .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, ; (No. ).
.In their telegrams, the ICFTU and WCL refer to the arrest of trade unionists following a general strike organised by the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) of Argentina on  July  in support of the workers' social and economic demands. The complainant organisations mention several trade union leaders as having been arrested: Sal Ubaldini, Secretary-General of the CGT; JOSE Rodriguez, Secretary-General of the SMATA trade union; Lesio Romero, Secretary-General of the rubber trade union; Ricardo Prez, Secretary-General of the truckers' trade union; Manuel Diaz Rey, Secretary-General of the commercial travellers' trade union; Antonio Cladera, dockers' trade union; Oswaldo Borda, rubber trade union; and Fernando Donaires, member of the executive Committee of the CGT. According to the ICFTU, the trade unionists face a possible ten-year prison sentence.
.In its letter dated  August , the ICFTU explains that the CGT had issued a strike order in June  in support of the mainly economic demands of the workers, hitherto ignored by the employers and Government of Argentina. The union action was planned for  July . On  July, the Government announced that it would severely repress ""any show of force constituting a threat to internal peace and security"".
.The  July day of protest whereby, according to the ICFTU, the Argentinian workers wished to show their concern in face of the steady drop in purchasing power and the constant increase in unemployment culminated in a display of severe repression by the authorities. The ICFTU further claims that  CGT leaders were arrested several of whom, at the time the complaint was presented, were still in prison. According to an official statement, all these union leaders were liable to indictment for violation of the law prohibiting the use of force or the state of emergency and face heavy prison sentences.
.In its letter dated  August , the Government states that Jos Rodriguez, Lesio Romero, Ricardo Manuel Prez, Manuel Diaz Rey and Alberto Alfonso Cladera were placed under preventive arrest by the police on  July  for instigating a strike. They were all released on  July, in accordance with a decision of the national judge of first instance. The Government adds that Sal Ubaldini, arrested on  July , was also released.
.The Government further claims that Fernando Donaires and Oswaldo Borda were not detained but were cleared of all charges by the judge.
.According to the Government the ""day of protest"" was aimed at bringing political pressure to bear on the Government and that the direct action resorted to by the persons involved was not concerned with any labour dispute or the defence of occupational interests.
.In its November  communication, the Government explains that the organisation which calls itself the CGT decided to call a ""day of protest"" on  July . The decision was contained in a document dated  July, in which the CGT proposed a combined action by the national community in the form of a total stoppage of activities for  hours.
.A few days earlier, the Minister of Labour had declared that direct action of this nature was not called for. He had stated that, in the circumstances prevailing in the country, dialogue and participation by the sectors concerned was the proper method for resolving the problems facing the capital and labour sectors. He further observed that the two sectors involved were very clearly defending their interests and that each was aware that, over and above its own interests, there was a higher general interest, which was the interest of an entire society.
.In the Government's view, the motive behind the day of protest and its expected outcome were clearly political. As for the significance of the protest, the Government points out that the majority wing of the trade union movement, namely the National Labour Commission and the Group of , expressed its disagreement with the stoppage of activities proposed by the CGT. These organisations, moreover, publicly announced their intention to pursue the dialogue proposed and successfully conducted by the Government.
.The Government goes on to remark that the National Labour Commission and Group of  were designated to represent the workers in Argentina's tripartite delegation to the International Labour Conference and that their powers could not legitimately be contested. In the Government's opinion, this had some bearing on the political connotation given to the call for a day of protest. The Government also claims that the CGT's day of protest was observed partially in the industrial suburbs of Buenos Aires, was less successful than expected by the CGT leaders in the interior of the country and went virtually unnoticed in the federal capital.
.According to the Government, none of the many instances of direct action that have taken place recently have been countered by repression on the part of the authorities. In this case, however, and because of the urgency of the situation, the political connotation given to the proposed movement resulted in the application of national security legislation as an exceptional measure in order to prevent the use of strike action for motives that were unrelated to the defence of occupational interests.
.Following the day of protest, several persons were called before the national judge of first instance. These included Sal Ubaldini, Alberto Cladera, Ricardo Prez, Oswaldo Borda, Fernando Donaires, Jos Rodriguez, Manuel Diaz Rey and Lesio Romero. Of these, Fernando Donaires and Oswaldo Borda, who were in hiding, were not charged but a ""provisional accusation"" was registered against them. The other persons charged were released after having been kept in preventive detention. The prosecutor appealed against the decisions but his appeal was rejected and the decision to release the persons held and not to charge the others was confirmed.
.As regards the other unionists who had been arrested and whose names were not given in the complaints, the Government states that they have all been released and that none were detained for more than  or  hours.
.In conclusion, the Government invokes certain principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association relating to political strikes and requests that the complaint be rejected.
.This case relates essentially to the day of protest and work stoppage called by the General Confederation of Labour of Argentina on  July . As a result of this action, the principal leaders of the CGT and several unionists were arrested. All these persons were brought to trial and eventually released.
.The complainants allege that the action was called to support the economic and social demands of the workers. On the other hand, the Government claims that the movement had political connotations and that its objective was not the defence of the workers' occupational interests.
.The Committee has always considered that the right to strike is a legitimate and, indeed, an essential means whereby workers may promote and defend their occupational interests. However, the right to strike constitutes a fundamental right of workers and their organisations only in so far as it is utilised as a means of defending those interests. Accordingly, the prohibition of strikes designed to coerce the Government, if they are not occupational in character, does not constitute an infringement of freedom of association. Nevertheless, the right to strike should not be restricted solely to industrial disputes likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement. Workers' organisations should be allowed to express in a broader context their dissatisfaction as concerns economic and social matters affecting their members' interests.
.In the present case, the contradictory statements of the complainants and of the Government make it impossible to establish beyond doubt the precise nature of the strike called by the CGT. Be that as it may, the Committee is obliged to note, as it did previously in connection with Case No.  which concerns Argentina, that the right to strike has been suspended in this country for over five years. In these circumstances, the Committee feels that it should once again recall that a general suspension of the right to strike is a major obstacle to the exercise of the right of trade unions to organise their activities which is not in conformity with the generally recognised principles of freedom of association.
.With regard to the arrests that took place in connection with the day of protest, the Committee notes that the persons detained have been released. It would, however, emphasise hat the preventive detention of trade unionists can lead to a serious interference in union affairs and that the police authorities should therefore be given precise",-1,1981,Argentina
341,"instructions so as to prevent people being arrested, in cases where public order is not seriously threatened, simply for having organised or participated in a demonstration.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) with regard to the general suspension of the right to strike, which has lasted for over five years, the Committee recalls that a measure of this nature is a major obstacle to the right of trade unions to organise their activities which is not in conformity with the generally recognised principles of freedom of association;(b) as regards the arrests, the Committee notes that the persons detained have been released. It emphasises, however, that the police authorities should be given precise instructions so as to prevent the arrest of persons, in cases where public order is not seriously threatened, simply for having organised or participated in a demonstration.",3,1981,Argentina
342,".In a letter of  June  the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint of violation of trade union rights in Argentina. The Government sent its observations in a communication received by the ILO on  November .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint the ICFTU alleges that the Argentine authorities have interfered with trade union activities. The ICFTU explains that the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) of Argentina had called all the trade union organisations to a plenary assembly on  May  to discuss labour problems (wages and others) and the designation by the Government of the Argentine workers' delegation to the International Labour Conference. The assembly was to have been held at the headquarters of the Sole Federation of Commercial Travellers.
.At midday on  May  the Secretary-General of the Sole Federation of commercial Travellers, Mr. Manuel Diaz Rey, was called to the Police Department where he was informed that the meeting had been prohibited.
.Nevertheless, the complainant continues, at  p.m. on the same day  representatives of the organisations called to the meting arrived at the building where it was to have been held but were forbidden entry by the federal police. The ICFTU concludes that this prohibition constitutes a restriction of trade union activities.
.In its reply the Government states firstly that the right of assembly, which is laid down in the Constitution, is governed by laws regulating its exercise. For example, Act No.  of  January , a copy of which is supplied by the Government, establishes the basic requirements for the exercise of the right of assembly and the powers invested in the law-enforcement authorities.
.The Government explains that after the assembly had been called by a group calling itself the ""General Confederation of Labour"", on the day on which it was to be held the federal police, considering that incidents might occur between different factions claiming to represent the labour movement, published a statement explaining that the prohibition of the assembly was in accordance with the provisions of Act No.  respecting the right of assembly.
.On the same day the Secretary-General of the Sole Federation of Commercial Travellers, Mr. Manuel Diaz Rey, a member of the General Confederation of labour, visited the Federal Security Superintendent's office where he was notified that the assembly had been prohibited and was referred to the relevant legislation. In the afternoon other persons arriving at the meeting place were informed of the authorities' decision.
.In conclusion, the Government states that supervision by government bodies of the activities of members of the population and their compliance with the law mean that there is interference with or restriction of trade union activities by the authorities. Such supervision, on the contrary, is intended to protect the general interests of the community.
.This case concerns the prohibition of a meeting of representatives of a number of trade unions belonging to an organisation known as the General Confederation of Labour. According to the Government, the federal police prohibited this meeting because they feared that incidents might occur.
.The Committee has examined the provisions of Act No.  respecting the right of assembly. It observes that, under section , authorisation must be obtained from the police authorities for holding meetings on the public thoroughfare or in places normally open to the public. Under section , the police may deny such authorisation when the meeting is organised for the purpose of disturbing public order or causing damage to persons or property, when the group of organisers is pursuing an illegal aim, or when the organisation in question is not an association, company, entity, political party or group legally recognised by the competent authorities.
.The Committee notes that the meeting planned for  May concerned trade union affairs since the agenda included a discussion of wages and other labour problems as well as the composition of the Argentine delegation of workers to the International Labour Conference. Furthermore, the meeting was to take place in closed trade union premises, and accordingly it would not seem that any disturbance on the public thoroughfare was to be feared.
.Consequently, the Committee considers it useful to remind the Government that the right of workers' organisations freely to organise meetings in trade union premises, without the need for prior authorisation or supervision by the public authorities, constitutes an essential element of freedom of association, without which it would be meaningless.",-1,1981,Argentina
343,".By a communication dated  October , the Staff Association of the World Health Organisation (WHO) at Geneva presented a claim against the Government of Argentina based on article  of the ILO Constitution alleging violation of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), both of which have been ratified by Argentina.
.The Committee proceeded to a preliminary examination of these allegations on the basis of decisions previously taken by the Governing Body in similar situations where a communication submitted under article  of the Constitution had concerned, in the complainant's opinion, freedom of association questions.
.The Association mentioned above states that Miss Viviana Ercilia Micucci, an Argentine citizen and international official working for a subsidiary body of the Panamerican Health Organisation (which is a regional organisation of WHO), was abducted on  November . The complainant states that as she was a member of the staff, she was automatically a member of a staff association, an association with which the management had consultations on such matters as a compensation scale. Miss Micucci was a member of a joint staff/management subcommittee engaged in a salary survey within the United Nations common system. It is understood, says the complainant, that material on this survey has also disappeared. According to the complainant, there is a reason to suppose that the abduction has resulted from her activity as a staff representative and that the Government of Argentina has failed to protect her rights under the Conventions mentioned above.
.The Committee has undertaken a preliminary examination of the nature of the allegations made, to the exclusion of any other question which this communication could raise. It notes, in particular, that Miss Micucci does not appear to have been appointed as a trade union officer by the staff, but that she was ""automatically"" a member of the staff association, as an official in the international organisation concerned. In addition, the complainant does not establish a prima facie case that the abduction - by persons unknown - was linked in some way to activities of a trade union nature. It merely points out that Miss Micucci was a member of a joint subcommittee engaged in a salary survey concerning international officials and that documents concerning this survey are also understood to have disappeared. The Committee is of the opinion that the elements submitted do not establish an apparent link between the events described in the complaint and the obligations arising for the State concerned from Conventions Nos.  and . It considers that the complainant has not produced any facts which tend to prove that Argentina, in the case at hand, has failed to secure the effective observance - in the terms of article , paragraph  of the Standing Orders relating to the procedure to be followed in the case of representations under article  of the Constitution of the ILO - of the instruments mentioned above. On the other hand the Committee has learned that steps have been taken by the Secretariat of the United Nations regarding the situation of this international official.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph, to dismiss this communication without transmitting it to the Government concerned.",-1,1979,Argentina
344,".The Committee already examined this case at its sessions in November  and February , on each of which occasions it presented an interim report.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations mentioned in the complaint and in the representation submitted by various Peruvian trade union organisations under article  of the ILO Constitution relate to the arrest or disappearance of serving or former trade unionists, the taking over of trade union organisations and restrictions on trade union activities.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the arrest or disappearance of serving or former trade unionists:(i) to note that certain other persons have been released since its last session;(ii) to note, however, that many of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are still in detention without having been brought before courts and to recall the principle that the rapid appearance of a detained trade unionist before the appropriate court is a fundamental right of the individual which is essential in order to safeguard fully the exercise of trade union rights; and to request the Government to provide information on the outcome of the judicial proceedings in respect of those persons who are to be tried by the federal courts;(iii) as regards those persons who, the Government states, are neither being sought nor in prison, to request the Government to extend its co-operation by continuing to seek information as to the situation of those persons, and to request the complainant organisations to provide any further information available to them concerning these same persons;(b) regarding the taking over of trade union organisations and restrictions on trade union activities:(i) to strongly reiterate the urgency of lifting all measures of control by the authorities over trade union organisations and to urge the Government to give priority to the lifting of such measures;(ii) to draw attention to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above concerning restrictions on trade union activities and to express the hope that the restrictions now in force will soon be removed; and, in particular, as regards collective bargaining, to request that one of the objectives of the Government should be to permit its restoration as soon as possible;(iii) with regard to the proposed new law on trade unions to request the Government to supply full information regarding the progress made towards the adoption of this legislation and to express once again the hope that the adoption and application of this law in the near future will ensure the restoration of full, normal, trade union activities;(iv) to request the Government to supply all available information on the evolution of the trade union situation;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined this case at its session in November , when it submitted an interim report.
.The allegations mentioned in the complaints and in representation submitted by various Peruvian trade union organisations under article  of the ILO Constitution relate to the arrest or disappearance of serving or former trade unionists, the taking over of trade union organisations and restrictions on trade union activities.
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government but must note with regret, first of all, that despite the time which has elapsed trade union organisations are still under the control of the authorities. In this connection, the Committee wishes to point out that the placing of trade union organisations under control constitutes a serious danger of restricting the rights of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities. The Committee considers that the Government should give priority to the lifting of this measure.
.Regarding the restrictions placed on trade union activities, the Committee notes the new statements by the Government concerning the temporary nature of these measures and its intention to return gradually to normal conditions. It considers in this connection that maintenance of the restrictions placed on the right to meet and to carry out elections in workers' organisations would constitute a serious infringement of trade union freedoms. The Committee hopes that restrictions of this type will soon cease.
.With particular reference to the suspension of collective bargaining and the right to strike, the Committee notes that these measures are temporary and have been necessitated by the economic situation in the country. Whilst fully aware of the seriousness of the economic situation in Argentina, the Committee considers that these restrictions should not be maintained longer than is reasonable. It considers in particular that one of the objectives of the Government should be to permit the restoration of collective bargaining as soon as possible.
.The Committee also notes that a new law on workers' associations is being prepared. It hopes that the adoption of this law will soon make it possible to restore full, normal trade union activities.
.In these circumstances and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the arrest or disappearance of serving and former trade unionists:(i) to note with interest that several trade unionists have been released;(ii) to express its concern with the fact that the Government states that it possesses no information on many of the persons mentioned by the complainants, to request the Government to intensify its investigations regarding these persons and to inform it of the results;(iii) to invite the complainant organisations to submit all additional information which they may possess regarding these persons;(iv) to note that some persons are at the disposal of the executive authorities without having been brought before the courts and recall that the rapid appearance of a detained trade unionist before the appropriate court is a civil liberty which is essential in order to safeguard fully the exercise of trade union rights;(v) to request the Government to supply information on the persons concerning whom it has not yet submitted observations;(b) regarding the taking over of trade union organisations and restrictions on trade union activities:(i) to note with regret that, despite the time which has elapsed, trade union organisations are still under the control of the authorities and point out to the Government that it should give priority to the lifting of this measure;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above concerning the restrictions on trade union activities with regard to meetings, elections, collective bargaining and strikes;(iii) to note that a new law on trade unions is being prepared and to express the hope that the adoption of this law will shortly make it possible to restore fully normal trade union activities throughout the country;(iv) to request the Government to supply all possible information on the evolution of the trade union situation;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions was contained in a communication dated  March . The WFTU, in further communications, dated  April and  June , submitted additional information and allegations in connection with the complaint. The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour was contained in a communication dated  June . In further communications, dated  June and  October June , the WCL submitted additional information and allegations in connection with the complaint.
.In a communication dated  May  the National Confederation of Workers of Peru and a number of other trade union organisations in Peru submitted, in accordance with article  of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, a representation that Argentina was failing to secure the effective observance of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina. The Committee examined this complaint in accordance with a decision taken previously by the Governing Body in a similar situation where a representation made under article  related to matters concerning freedom of association.
.The above-mentioned complaints, additional information and allegations, and the representation referred to in the preceding paragraph were duly transmitted to the Government for observations in accordance with the usual procedure applicable in connection with complaints of alleged infringements of trade union rights.
.The Government, in a communication dated  May , transmitted certain observations in reply to some of the allegations made against it. Further observations and information were transmitted by the Government in three communications dated  and  October and  November .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In all these circumstances and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the taking over by the Government of the General Confederation of Labour and a number of other trade union organisations, and the general restrictions imposed on the activities of workers' and employers' organisations,(i) to take note of the Government's explanations and",-1,1976,Argentina
345,"statements, especially as regards the temporary and emergency nature of these measures and its intention to re-establish a normal trade union situation;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs ,  and  and, in particular, to the right of these organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, as established in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina;(iii) to request the Government to indicate the measures which it intends to take or has taken in this connection and to keep the Governing Body informed of any developments in the matter; and to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case;(b) with regard to the arrest and detention of trade unionists,(i) to note that Alberto Ignacio Campos has been released;(ii) to note that Miguel Unamuno, Francisco Esquerra and Aleis Rovella have been charged with fraudulent acts and to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgments rendered by the courts concerning these persons;(iii) to note that the  workers of the ""Ploghi SRL"" undertaking in Cordoba have been released, and to draw the attention of the Government to the principle mentioned in paragraph  with regard to the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found;(iv) to request the Government to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning all the trade unionists named by the complainants as having been arrested (including Jun Vasquez), and to draw the attention of the Government to the principle mentioned in paragraph  that all arrested persons should be subject without delay to normal judicial procedure;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested above.",1,1976,Argentina

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) referred to the case of an official of the Metalworkers' Union, Jos Palacios, said to have been abducted in Buenos Aires on  December  by a band of masked persons as he was leaving work. The following night armed and masked persons broke into his home, taking away with them personal and trade union documents and ill-treating his wife.
.In its reply, the Government pointed out that the alleged events were supposed to have taken place on  December , or four months before the present Government came to power. It added that investigations into this case were nevertheless being made, but so far without success.
.At its November  session, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, inter alia,- to draw the Government's attention to certain principles relating to the responsibility of a government for any effects which events that had occurred under another government might continue to have since the new government came to power;- to note that the Government had had investigations made as regards the whereabouts of Jos Palacios;- to request the Government to continue these investigations and to communicate any information which might come to light concerning his fate.
.In its communication of  February , the Government stated that it had continued intensive investigations with a view to finding Jos Palacios. The Government added that the Ministry of Labour had requested the Ministry of the Interior to step up these inquiries. In a note dated  December , the latter Ministry had stated that with this end in view it had sent telegrams, but that in order to intensify its investigations it wished to have fuller information about the circumstances of this disappearance and the time and place where it occurred.
.The Government added that, despite all the efforts made by the competent authorities, it had been impossible to find Jos Palacios. However, the authorities were still endeavouring to elucidate this matter, and the Committee would immediately be informed of any new developments.
.The Committee notes that investigations with a view to finding Jos Palacios are being continued, but so far without success. It also notes that in order to intensify these investigations the government would like to have fuller information about the circumstances of Jos Palacios's disappearance. The Committee accordingly considers that it would be desirable to request the complainant organisation to supply further details concerning the circumstances of this disappearance.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern at the fact that the investigations by the authorities with a view to finding Jos Palacios have so far been unsuccessful;(b) to request the Government to inform it of any new developments in this case;(c) to request the complainant organisation to supply any further particulars it can obtain concerning the circumstances of Jos Palacios's disappearance;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.In a communication dated  January  the World Confederation of Labour presented a complaint concerning interference with the exercise of trade union rights in Argentina.
.The text of the above-mentioned communication was transmitted to the Government, which formulated its observations in a letter dated  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the WCL refers initially to the numerous disappearances which occur in Argentina and to the wave of violence which is a constant feature of life in the country.
.In this connection the complainant mentions the case of the leader of the Metalworkers' Union, Jos Palacios, said to have been abducted on  December  in Buenos Aires by a band of masked persons as he was leaving work. The following night armed and masked persons broke into his home, taking away with them personal and trade union documents, ill-treating his wife and threatening her with death if she did not divulge information concerning the trade union activities of her husband. This took place in the presence of the abducted man's son, who was also roughly handled.
.The WCL states that Jos Palacios is known as a most active trade unionist. He has held various trade union positions in the metal industry and been President of the Young Christian workers of Argentina. It also indicates that there has been no news of him since his disappearance and expresses fear for his life.
.In its reply, the Government, referring to the vague and ill-defined nature of the WCL's initial statements, declares that the present wave of violence in Argentina is due to terrorist action by extremist organisations which are seeking to destroy society with help from outside the country. The community as a whole and national institutions are making an effort to counter such action.
.With regard to Jos Palacios, the Government points out that the alleged events are supposed to have taken place on  December , or four months before it came to power. It adds that investigations into this case have nevertheless been carried out, but so far without success.
.The Committee has already had occasion to point out that, while a government cannot be held responsible for events which have occurred under another government, it is clearly responsible for any effects which such events may continue to have since it came to power. When there is a change of government in a country the new government should take all measures necessary to remedy any consequences which the alleged actions may continue to produce even though they took place under its predecessor.
.With respect to the disappearance of Jos Palacios, the Committee notes that all attempts to find him have so far failed.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the principles set out in paragraph  above(b) to note that the Government has had investigations made as regards the whereabouts of Jos Palacios;(c) to request the Government to continue these investigations and to communicate any information which may come to light concerning his fate;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit another report when it has received the information requested.",1,1976,Argentina
347,".The Committee already examined this case in May  and submitted at that session an interim report which is reproduced in paragraphs - of its st Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (May ).
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As the Committee has pointed out in a previous case concerning Argentina, what it is concerned with is not whether the action taken is legal under Argentine law, but whether the legal powers vested in the Argentine Government have been exercised in a manner inconsistent with freedom of association. The Committee emphasised the importance of due process in cases in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political nature or offences under the ordinary law. The requirement of due process would not appear to be fulfilled if under the national law the effect of a state of emergency is that a court cannot make and does not make an examination of the merits of the case. The Committee also considered that the granting to a trade unionist of his freedom on condition that he leaves the country is not compatible with the free exercise of trade union rights. In view of this, the Committee feels that it would be desirable for the Government to reconsider Mr. Ongaro's case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the allegations respecting the withdrawal of trade union status from the FGB, to note the information submitted by the Government;(b) regarding the detention of Mr. Ongaro, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations and principles set out in paragraph  above, in particular, concerning the possibility of reviewing his case, and to emphasise that no trade unionist should be kept in prison or deprived of his freedom of movement without having been brought before the courts with the least possible delay.
.The complaint was submitted by a communication of  December  and the complainants, provided additional information by a letter of  December . The Government sent its observations in a communication of  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has already had occasion to consider questions of arrest during states of emergency, specifically in a case concerning Argentina and a previous arrest of Mr. Ongaro. Although it has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency, it has emphasised that such measures should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period and that a person under arrest should be afforded the guarantee of regular judicial proceedings with the least possible delay.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the withdrawal of trade union status from the Buenos Aires Printers' Federation:(i) to call attention to the principles and considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above;(ii) in view of the consequences of this measure, to suggest to the Government that it consider the possibility of reviewing its decision;(b) regarding the detention of Mr. Ongaro, to recall the principles set out in paragraph  above and to request the Government to supply, in the light of these principles, detailed information regarding Mr. Ongaro's situation;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has obtained the information requested.Geneva,  May .

.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January  the complainant alleges that the Ministry of Labour has threatened to revoke its ""trade union status"" and its right to represent workers.
.In its letter of  May  the Government states that it is of the opinion that the complaint does not provide a sufficient basis upon which to found a case. It states further that the conditions prevailing in the country have caused it to introduce anti-inflationary measures to prevent the constant diminution of the real value of incomes. For this purpose a National Accord dealing with salaries was drawn up by Government, employers and workers and is contained in Act No. , which also affirmed the provisions of Act No.  concerning the negotiation of collective agreements. Recently, according to the Government, wages and salaries have been adjusted according to these legal provisions. The Government adds that the principles of Convention No.  are applied in the country on the basis of a true coincidence of aims of Government and organised labour.
.The Committee considers that if ministerial revocation of the trade union status of the complainant organisation should effectively prevent it from exercising normal trade union functions, this would appear to call in question the principle established in Convention No.  according to which workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority.

.The complainants allege that Mr. Felipe Burgos, Secretary-General of the Single Federation of Agricultural Workers of Argentina (FUSTCA), was arrested by the police merely on account of his trade union activity.
.The complainants state that, by imprisoning this union leader, the Government violated the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and  and trampled underfoot the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
.In its observations, the Government affirms that Mr. Felipe Burgos has never at any time been arrested on account of his trade union activities, since the representatives of the country's occupational associations of workers enjoy total freedom to perform their trade union functions within the framework of the National Constitution.
.The Government goes on to say that the reason for Mr. Burgos's arrest was his connection with a subversive group which had attempted to take over the locality of Ampacaschi, in the province of Salta. It was for this reason that Mr. Burgos was summoned to appear before the Federal Criminal Court, since the acts he was suspected of committing constituted a criminal offence upon which this court was competent to sit in judgement.
.The Government adds that the court in question ordered the release of Mr. Burgos on  October .
.On the basis of the evidence before it, the Committee considers that proof has not been established that the action taken against Mr. Felipe Burgos had any connection with his trade union activities. Moreover, the person concerned has since been released on the instructions of the Federal Criminal Court.

As regards the "" old cattle boat "" (viejo barco ganadero), the Government explains that it is in fact a prison ship called the "" Granadero "", which according to a recent report by the Minister of Justice (quoted by the Government in its reply) complies with the relevant health standards.
.The Government goes on to state that the accused was provisionally released on  June  (a fact confirmed by the World Confederation of Labour in its communication dated  August ) and that, on  July, he was granted a partial, provisional stay of proceedings.
.According to the information supplied by the Government, it would appear that Mr. Beltrn was charged before a regular court and that the grounds for the proceedings against him were unconnected with his trade union office or activities. For their part, the complainants did not specifically allege that his arrest was due to his trade union membership or activities.
.Accordingly, the Committee considers that it has not been proved that there was any connection between the proceedings taken against Mr. Beltrn and the free exercise of his trade union rights, and recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination on its part.",-1,1972,Argentina
352,".The complaint is contained in a communication addressed direct to the ILO by the General Confederation of Labour on  February . This complaint was supported by the International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions, the International Metalworkers' Federation, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the International Federation of Building and Woodworkers, the International Transport Workers' Federation and the International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Associations.
.The complaint was transmitted to the Government of Argentina, which forwarded its observations in two communications dated  April and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants maintain that the right to conclude collective agreements, laid down in Convention No. , is likewise embodied in the National Constitution and in Act No.  of . This Act has been continuously in force, with the exception of a few periods in recent years when it was suspended by the Government. The complainants state that fresh negotiations were to be held to revise the collective agreements reached in , and that the revised agreements would have come into force on  April . Before the expiry of the old agreements, however, the Government promulgated Act No.  whereby the collective agreements in force were extended until  October  and absurdly low percentages fixed for wage increases. By this action, the complainants maintain, the Government infringed not only a Constitutional guarantee but also Convention No. . The General Confederation of Labour appealed to the President to have the wage measures repealed, but to no avail.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the Constitutional provision to which the complainants refer does not prevent the State from postponing collective bargaining when the economic situation makes such action advisable, or from promulgating legislation ensuring decent conditions of work and fair wages for the workers in accordance with the terms of the Constitution itself. Act No.  has neither abolished nor suspended the system of collective agreements but has merely extended the agreements already in force. In so doing, the Government has taken account of an exceptional economic and political situation and its aim is to check the inflation that is reducing the purchasing power of the population. The President has stated that the Government's fundamental objectives are the maintenance of real wages, a high rate of investment in public works, the prevention of recession, the slowing down of the rate of inflation by means other than purely monetary measures, the reorganisation of public finance on a sound footing, increased domestic savings and the rational use of foreign savings.
.The Government concludes by saying that to enable workers to keep up with the rising cost of living, the above-mentioned Act (No. ) has also established percentages for wage increase for the periods  January to  June  and  July to  December . As part of a coherent wage policy, a reasonable increase has also been made in the minimum living wage.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that on  April  the President announced important economic and social measures. The decisions taken included one concerning the convening, during the second half of the current year, of the joint committees provided for in Act No.  "" to draw up the new collective agreements that will come into force on  January  "". The Government adds that this is proof of the firm intention of the authorities to comply with Convention No. .
.The Committee recalls that it has already stated in the past, in two cases concerning Argentina, that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.)
.The Committee has also referred in the past to certain procedures designed to ensure that the parties to collective bargaining have regard voluntarily in their negotiations to considerations relating to the economic or social policy of the government and the safeguarding of the national interest. In this respect the Committee has pointed out that it was necessary first of all that the objectives to be recognised as being in the general interest should have been widely discussed by all parties on a national scale through a body such as a national social policy advisory board, in accordance with the principle laid down by the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ). It might also be possible to envisage a procedure whereby the attention of the parties could be drawn, in certain cases, to the considerations of general interest which might call for further examination of the terms of agreement on their part. If the public authority considered that the terms of the proposed agreements were manifestly in conflict with the economic policy objectives recognised as being desirable in the general interest, the cases could be submitted for advice and recommendation to an appropriate consultative body, it being understood, however, that the final decision in the matter rested with the parties to the agreement.,",0,1972,Argentina
353,".The complaint lodged by the World Confederation of Labour is contained in two communications, dated  May and  June , and the complaint of the Federation of Printers of Buenos Aires in two communications dated  June and  July . These communications were transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations on  August,  November and  December  and  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The various communications from the complainants refer to the fact that Mr. Raimundo Ongaro, a printers' leader and General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of Argentinian Workers (of which the Federation of Printers of Buenos Aires is a member) and substitute member of the ILO Governing Body, was arrested by the police on  May . He was imprisoned by virtue of a Presidential Decree, No. /, which was issued in accordance with the powers conferred upon the President by article  of the Constitution. Although, according to one of the complainants, there is no specific charge against Mr. Ongaro and some government representatives are said to have stated that his imprisonment was due to supposed subversive activities (an accusation refuted by Mr. Ongaro), another of the complaints states that criminal proceedings have been instituted against him before the Federal Court of Resistencia (in the province of Chaco) for offences of incitement to violence and rebellion.
.The complainants also refer to the various trials undergone by Mr. Ongaro in the past, always charged with political offences or with offences related to political matters, in which the judge dismissed the case. Mr. Ongaro's present imprisonment is the second to which he has been subjected, being held at the disposal of the Executive; the first period of imprisonment lasted from  June to  November . According to the complainants, all these facts constitute proof that Mr. Ongaro is the victim of arbitrary persecution designed to induce him to give up his constant activities on behalf of the workers and of the deprived classes of Argentina. This persecution, it is alleged, takes many forms: trials for which, as the judgements subsequently show, there was no legal justification, imprisonments at the disposal of the Executive and abductions by the police.
.In its first communication, dated  August , the Government refers to certain statements made by Mr. Jos Rucci, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina, to the effect that the only leader called Ongaro is a political leader, and, consequently, not a workers' leader. According to the Government, this statement by the highest authority in the trade union sphere shows Mr. Ongaro's lack of representativity and implies that he is not covered by the safeguards enjoyed by genuine trade union leaders.
.Having been requested to send more specific information with regard to the charges against Mr. Ongaro, the reasons for his imprisonment, and his position before the law and in relation to the penal procedure, the Government sent a further communication on  November . In this communication the Government states that, when Mr. Ongaro decided to devote himself to political activities, he voluntarily withdrew from the trade union sphere, in which he holds no post whatsoever in any of the organisations connected with Argentinian trade union affairs. The Government goes on to say that this situation has been confirmed by the leaders of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina, who are the sole legal representatives of the Argentinian workers. With regard to the precise information for which it has been asked, the Government states that Mr. Ongaro was arrested for having repeatedly made public statements inciting the people to violence, rebellion and revolution and adds that a further reason for his arrest was the investigation into alleged acts which were calculated to put his words into action. To give a better idea of the situation, the Government encloses photocopies of various newspaper articles which, it states, show that Mr. Ongaro was engaged in activities of a political, rather than of a trade union, nature.
.The Government goes on to say that Mr. Ongaro was imprisoned by virtue of an Executive Decree which was issued in accordance with article  of the Constitution. The terms of this article are as follows: "" In the event of an internal upheaval or attack from outside the country, placing in jeopardy the implementation of this Constitution and the exercise of the authority conferred thereby, a state of emergency shall be declared in the province or territory where the disturbance has broken out, involving the suspension in that province or territory of the guarantees embodied in the Constitution. Throughout the period of suspension, however, the President of the Republic may not pronounce judgement or sentence on his own account. His power in such cases shall be limited, in the case of individuals, to ordering their arrest or transfer from one place within the country to another, unless they prefer to leave Argentinian territory.""
.The Government concludes by stating that the State Prosecutor has arranged for the case to be brought before the judicial authorities of the province of Chaco, which have requested the Executive to have Mr. Ongaro transferred into their jurisdiction for his trial in accordance with the relevant judicial procedure. Consequently, the Government adds, it is obvious that the competent Argentinian authorities have acted in accordance with the procedural and statutory provisions in force, which are designed to ensure the maintenance of law and order in the country, which might be seriously undermined by such openly subversive attitudes as those advocated by Mr. Ongaro.
.In a subsequent communication, dated  December , the Government provides further information, according to which Mr. Ongaro was remanded in custody by the judicial authorities, charged with incitement to rebellion, an offence punishable under article  of the Penal Code. The charges are based on statements made by Mr. Ongaro in the town of Resistencia (in the province of Chaco) on  May , in the presence of journalists.
.Lastly, in its communication dated  January , the Government states that the President of the nation, in response to a request made by the General Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina, has ordered Mr. Ongaro's release.
.The Committee observes, as regards the functions of Mr. Ongaro, that although the Government maintains that he withdrew voluntarily from the trade union sphere, occupying no post whatsoever in the organisations connected with "" Argentinian trade union affairs "" (in support of which the Government quotes certain statements made by the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina), on the other hand the complainants (and available information derived from the press) refer to Mr. Ongaro as a printers' leader and General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of Argentinian Workers, a different organisation from that just mentioned.
.As regards Mr. Ongaro's position from the legal point of view, the Committee notes from the information supplied that he was arrested by order of the Executive and held at the disposal of the latter by virtue of the powers conferred on it by the Constitution in the event of a state of emergency and that, at the same time, the judicial authorities had remanded him in custody on charges under the Penal Code.
.With regard to measures of detention during a state of emergency, the Committee wishes to recall that although it has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency, it has emphasised that such measures should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period and that a person under arrest should be afforded the guarantee of regular judicial proceedings with the least possible delay.
.The Committee has examined the press reports furnished by the Government and containing the statements made by Mr. Ongaro on  May . Most of these refer to matters of a political nature.
.In any event, and in view of the fact that Mr. Ongaro has regained his freedom, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to what is stated in paragraph  above regarding the safeguards of regular judicial proceedings, that this case calls for no further examination.",1,1971,Argentina
354,".The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour is contained in a communication dated  December , addressed direct to the ILO. The text of it was transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations thereon by two communications dated  May and  September .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants refer to the arrest of two Argentine lawyers, "" closely connected with the Argentine trade union movement "", namely Mr. Rodriguez Anido, legal adviser to the regional office of Accin Sindical Argentina for the province of Tucumn, and his assistant, Mr. Salas Correa. These lawyers are said to have been arrested on the occasion of workers' demonstrations which took place in the city of San Miguel de Tucumn in November . At the time the complaint was filed these persons were allegedly being held at the Government's pleasure in Buenos Aires.
.In its reply the Government gives the following information. Mr. Rodriguez Anido, lawyer, was arrested on  November  for incitement, in connection with a demonstration of a political character, to actions disturbing public order and safety during the disturbances which occurred on that date in the city of San Miguel de Tucumn. By Decree No.  of  December , his detention at the Government's pleasure became inoperative and he was freed on  December of the same year.
.Mr. Salas Correa, lawyer, was arrested on  November , for participating in actions which disturbed public order and safety on  and  November of the same year in the city of San Miguel de Tucumn. By virtue of Decree No.  of  December  his detention during the Government's pleasure became inoperative and he was released.
.It would appear from the Government's explanations that the reason for the action taken against these persons was acts constituting a disturbance of public order and safety committed by them during demonstrations which took place in San Miguel de Tucumn and having no direct connection with the exercise of trade union rights. For their part, the complainants, who merely mention that the persons concerned are "" closely connected with the Argentine trade union movement "", offer no evidence that there was any breach of freedom of association in this instance.
.In any event, since the persons in question are now at liberty, the Committee, considering that it would be pointless for it to pursue its examination of this case, recommends the Governing Body to decide that it does not call for further examination.",-1,1970,Argentina
355,".The present case, which deals essentially with the take-over by the administrative authorities of trade union organisations belonging to the complainant organisation, was previously examined by the Committee at its session of November , when an interim report was submitted, contained in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th report. This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).
.At its session in November  the Committee submitted its conclusions on the questions mentioned in the complaint and drew the attention of the Government to the principles of freedom of association relating to the case.
.Having noted, however, a statement by the Government according to which between July and September  elections would take place which would completely regularise the situation of the Federation of the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State, the Committee thought it appropriate before closing the case to request the Government to be kind enough to state whether elections had taken place in those sections of the Federation which had been taken over and whether the take-overs had now been brought to an end.
.This request was brought to the notice of the Government, which replied by an undated communication received by the ILO on  June .
.In this communication the Government indicated that the Union of Wage Earners and Salaried Employees of the YPF and the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State at Plaza Huincul had held elections on  July  and that "" the management of the affairs of these Unions was handed over to the officials elected upon that occasion "".
.In these circumstances the situation of the trade unions constituting the complainant organisation appears to have returned to normal and the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint of the Federation of the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State is contained in a communication received by the ILO on  December , supplemented by a further two communications dated  January and  February . These communications were duly transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations on  June .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that by Acts Nos.  and  and Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour, the Government has taken over the Federation of the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State and its Buenos Aires and Ensenada branches. These measures were taken, respectively, in October and September . Some time later, in December , the Secretariat of State for Labour further ordered the taking over of the Plaza Huincul branch. The above-mentioned Acts state the grounds for the takeover as being the existence of serious irregularities in the administration of these organisations and repeated infringements of the laws and regulations, particularly as regards the administration of their funds and the keeping of accounts. In the case of the Plaza Huincul branch, the measure was said to have been taken on the grounds of "" activities alien to trade union affairs "", but the text of the decision for the takeover offered no explanation as to the nature of these activities.
.As concerns Resolution No. /, which relates to the Ensenada branch, the complainants allege that on  August  a group of persons attacked the offices of that branch, displacing the legitimate authorities thereof. The police are said to have protected the assailants, and the Secretariat of State for Labour, when requested to see that the premises were handed back to the legitimate authorities of the Federation, issued the aforementioned resolution, whereby these authorities were stripped of their office and a controller was appointed.
.The complainants add that prior to the adoption of the takeover measures, the Government had ordered an inquiry to be made into the accounts of the Federation and of its Buenos Aires branch. The lawful authorities of these organisations were not notified of the results of this inquiry, carried out by inspectors from various Government departments, nor were they called upon to present any defence against any charges that might have been made against them; they were thus denied the right to defend themselves.
.The complainants explain at length the political motives which in their view prompted the Government to take the measures described above, deriving from the attitude taken by the Federation and its General Secretary, Adolfo Cavalli, to the Government and to its social and trade union policy. In reality these measures are alleged to be reprisals designed to "" eliminate one of the keystones in the struggle to attain popular demands "". There has even been personal persecution of Mr. Cavalli, whose name has been removed, at the order of the Government, from the list of employees of the petroleum enterprise for which he worked.
.The complainants later describe the action taken by the controller appointed to manage the Federation and by the labour authorities once the takeover had taken effect. On the one hand, between October and December  all the funds of the Federation were frozen and it was unable to meet its financial commitments, with the result that not only did the organisation lose its good reputation, but also it was involved in greater expenditure, having to meet the costs of the legal proceedings brought as a result of its failure to honour its commitments. On the other hand, the controller did not comply with the terms of reference given to him when the takeover of the Federation was ordered. Under the terms of the relevant Act, he should have convened the Central Executive Board of the Federation (in accordance with article  of the Federation's statutes) in order that the Board might decide upon appropriate measures to restore the situation to normal. However, he did not convene the Board because he was prevented from doing so by the Secretary of State for Labour, and on  October he closed the headquarters of the Federation. Military officials had exerted pressure on various members of the Central Executive Board in an attempt to persuade them to appoint a certain person as General Secretary, but their action did not produce the desired results. Subsequently, on  January , the controller convened a group of  members of the Executive Board and, invoking an earlier agreement between the leaders of the Federation, appointed a National Secretariat to run the Federation until April . According to the complainants, this agreement was not the outcome of any regular meeting of the Central Executive Board but was an agreement reached by a group behind the backs of the entire Board and based on the pressure and threats constantly exerted by the pro-Government sector as well as the pressure exerted by the Secretariat of State for Labour.
.Lastly, according to the complainants' statement, in February  three of the most important branches of the Federation-those of Ensenada, Buenos Aires and Plaza Huincul-were still under the control of the Government.
.In its reply the Government states that the Federation of the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State was taken over on the grounds that the authorities of the union in question had been remiss in carrying out their responsibilities. Matters had reached such a point that the Secretariat of State for Labour took legal proceedings to ascertain whether what had been done amounted to an offence under the Criminal Code. It was for this reason that, in the preambles to the Acts ordering the takeover of the Federation and its Buenos Aires branch, no specific mention was made of the conduct of the members of the National Secretariat of the Federation, so as not to compromise a free decision by the courts. The Federation never exercised its right to go to law itself.
.In the case of the Ensenada branch, on account of certain administrative irregularities-including refusal to hold elections-the labour authorities appointed an electoral delegate with the specific task of arranging elections and regularising the whole matter. The Plaza Huincul branch was taken over because there was evidence that the persons running it were engaging in activities of a political character.
.The Government goes on to state that in accordance with the legislation authorising the taking over of the Federation, and with its statutes, the controller possessed all the powers normally vested in the National Secretariat, the Central Executive Board and the Congress of the Federation. By virtue of the above, it was decided that the representatives of the Federation's member unions should assume control. The Government adds that elections are being held between July and September this year to ensure that the workings of this organisation return fully to normal.
.With regard to the alleged blockage of the Federation's funds, the Government states that the controller arranged for an audit of the accounts and communicated the results to the legal authorities with a view to possible criminal proceedings on a charge of fraud, but",2,1970,Argentina
356,"that there was never any question of a blockage of funds as alleged by the complainants. Lastly, as concerns Mr. Adolfo Cavalli, who was General Secretary of the Federation at the time of the takeover, the Government states that his behaviour is at present being investigated with a view to criminal proceedings. Although the complainants allege that he was the victim of an unfair practice on the part of the undertaking employing him, the National Industrial Relations Council has no record of any protest on his part of the kind customary in such circumstances.
.The Committee observes that this is yet another case involving the taking over of trade unions by administrative authority, with the removal from office of their leaders and their replacement by an official appointed by the Government. The Committee has already had to examine a number of cases relating to Argentina involving the taking of similar measures by the authorities."" The Committee, considering that such measures are contrary to the principles of freedom of association, has drawn the Government's attention to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which provides that workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, too, has observed that on various occasions the Government of Argentina has dismissed managing committees of trade unions and has appointed in their stead controllers responsible for administering the respective organisations. In the opinion of the Committee of Experts, measures of this nature are not in conformity with Article  of Convention No. , and the removal of trade union leaders in cases where violations of the legislation or of the internal statutes have been proved, as well as the appointment of temporary administrators, should be effected through the courts.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association wishes to emphasise yet again that the right guaranteed to workers' organisations by Article  of Convention No. , and the obligation imposed thereby upon the public authorities to refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, do not mean that trade union leaders should be exempt from any supervision aimed at ensuring that their actions comply with the existing legislation (which in its turn should not run counter to the principles of freedom of association) or with the union's statutes. Nevertheless, it is of the greatest importance that in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, such control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority.
.As concerns the allegation that Mr. Adolfo Cavalli was the victim of an act of antiunion discrimination when his name was removed from the list of employees of the undertaking for which be worked, the Government has sent no information which throws light on this question. The Committee has pointed out in earlier cases, bearing in mind the provisions of Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), that it is one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association that workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment-dismissal, transfer or other prejudicial measures-and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office a The Committee observes that the legislation of Argentina (Act No.  respecting industrial associations of employees) contains a number of provisions for the protection of trade union officials and representatives in their employment, and that the National Industrial Relations Council is the body competent to examine complaints of infringement of these provisions and put matters right where it is proved that such infringement has taken place. In this respect the Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that no complaint concerning Mr. Cavalli has been filed with that body, as would have been natural in such a case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government in particular to the observations set forth in paragraphs  and  above;(b) to urge the Government to enact such provisions as are necessary in the light of these observations in order to bring national law and practice into harmony with Article  of Convention No. ;(c) to request the Government to provide information as to whether elections have been held in the taken-over branches of the Federation of the United Petroleum Trade Unions of the State, and whether the takeovers have now been brought to an end;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it is in possession of the information requested from the Government.Geneva,  November, . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1970,Argentina
357,".The complaint by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  July . It was transmitted to the Government of Argentina, which sent its observations on  January .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  June  the workers of the automobile mechanics section represented by the Union of Automobile Mechanics and Allied Workers of the City of Crdoba initiated a dispute with the firm of IKA-Renault which had refused to discuss the collective agreement that had just expired. As a reprisal the firm dismissed  workers. In addition, with the acquiescence of the provincial government, the company's security guards forcibly entered the private homes of workers and arrested them. A total of  members of the union were detained.
.In its reply the Government states first of all that in Argentina a magistrate is alone entitled to authorise the police to enter premises and that private individuals are in no circumstances authorised to do this.
.Concerning the collective dispute to which the complaint refers, the Government presents the following observations. Under Act No.  concerning collective agreements, the IKA-Renault firm began negotiations with the union in question. When it was found impossible to reach an agreement, the members of the union raided and occupied various factory premises on  June , taking several executives of the firm as hostages. The persons presumed responsible for these incidents have been indicted for violation of individual freedom, usurpation and unlawful association. On  June several workers were dismissed on these grounds.
.On  June the Secretariat of State for Labour issued a resolution calling for an end to the strike and providing for compulsory conciliation to be initiated in accordance with Act No.  concerning conciliation and arbitration in collective disputes. These instructions were not heeded, nor were conciliation proceedings started, and the Secretariat for Labour then issued a new resolution similar to its previous one. When the dispute continued, a further resolution was issued on  July repeating the instructions to stop the strike, and the firms affected were called upon to suspend the dismissals and other action taken since  June, the parties being summoned to a conciliation meeting.
.The conciliation proceedings finally began on  July the parties declaring that they would abide by the instructions mentioned above. Negotiations continued until  August, on which date the IKA-Renault firm made proposals that included the reinstatement of  workers (which was in fact carried out, more than this number being reinstated), payment of dismissal allowances to persons not reinstated and payment to the trade union leaders in the same situation of the dismissal allowance plus  per cent. The trade union leaders refused this proposal and requested the referral of the dispute to compulsory arbitration as established under Act No. . The Secretariat of State for Labour did not accept this request on the grounds that the Act in question was not applicable in the circumstances. The Government states in conclusion that the dispute has in fact been settled, almost every worker involved having individually accepted the firm's proposals.
.The Committee observes that, under Act No.  concerning conciliation and arbitration in collective disputes, when the parties fail to reach an agreement compulsory conciliation is required through the intervention of the Labour Authority. Until the dispute is referred to conciliation and during the relevant proceedings the workers are not allowed to declare a strike. This possibility is open to them only if conciliation breaks down and it is not agreed to submit the dispute for arbitration.
.The Committee has always considered that allegations concerning the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee has also on numerous occasions observed that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised. Nevertheless, the Committee has indicated that the right to strike may be subject to temporary restrictions placed thereon such as suspension of strikes during conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which parties can take part at every stage.
.In the present case in the absence of agreement on the negotiations not only did the workers declare a strike without going through compulsory conciliation, but some of them also occupied work premises and took several executives of the undertaking as hostages. Subsequently the strike continued despite the initiation of conciliation proceedings ordered by the Labour Authority. This resulted in the indictment of a number of workers for the offences stated by the Government and the dismissal of workers. Finally, the dispute was concluded and the dismissed workers were reinstated or compensation was paid to those not reinstated in almost all cases.
.In view of these circumstances and in the light of the considerations stated above in paragraph , the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case calls for no further examination.",0,1970,Argentina
358,".The Committee examined this case at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, contained in paragraphs - of its rd Report. The Governing Body approved this Report at its rd Session (May ).
.In the said Report certain further information and comments were requested from the Government, which sent them in two communications dated  May and  August  respectively.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It will be recalled that the complainants referred, in their complaint dated  June , to a previous complaint relating to the Government's decision in January  to take over the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers. On that occasion the Committee had recommended the Governing Body "" to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to restore the situation of the trade union organisation in question to normal as soon as possible "". The complainants went on to say that no measure was taken along these lines and that the authorities forcibly handed over the management of the Federation to Government supporters. The leaders imposed by the authorities proceeded to organise "" rigged "" elections at the end of November . The electoral Committee, made up of persons who had no connection with the organisation, produced no lists of candidates and refused to allow the ballot boxes to be kept on the Federation's premises, as was customary. As a result, the complainants alleged, a large number of members of the Federation abstained from voting.
.In its reply dated  October , the Government referred to the elections held within the Federation, stating that there had been no electoral Committee and no allegations of electoral fraud. The government-appointed controller of the organisation, an official from the Secretariat of State for Labour, organised an election on  February  and, at the Congress held one month later, the new authorities of the Federation were elected, taking over the trade union organisation on  March . The Congress had submitted a single list of candidates, which obtained  votes from the  delegates.
.At its session in February  the Committee observed, primarily, that the procedure whereby the leaders of the Federation were elected did not reach its culmination until two years after the takeover of the organisation by the public authorities. The Committee considered it necessary to emphasise in this respect the importance it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which lays down that "" workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes "", and that "" the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof "".
.As regards the elections themselves, the Committee observed that, in their account of the events, the complainants referred to what appeared to have been primary elections, held in November  for the purpose of electing delegates to the Congress which was to have the actual task of electing the leaders of the Federation. The Government had supplied certain details about this Congress but, apart from stating that there had been no electoral Committee, it had made no comment on the remaining assertions of the complainants with regard to these primary elections, which concerned alleged irregularities in regard to the displaying of a list of candidates and the custody of the ballot boxes.
.It would appear from certain trade union leaflets, of which copies were supplied to the Committee by the complainants, that the group of trade unionists ousted as a result of the takeover hold the takeover responsible, in particular, for the following facts: that the rolls listing the names and other particulars of the electors were not made available to those on the officially authorised lists of candidates; that the ballot boxes were not allowed to be kept on the Federation's premises; that the persons on the officially authorised list of candidates were not permitted to be on the electoral Committee (or board); and that no announcement was made as to when and where the voting was to take place. Accordingly, the group of trade unionists in question announced the withdrawal of their list of candidates and urged the workers to boycott the election.
.The Committee recalled Decree No.  of , which was apparently in force at the time of the elections, and which contains certain provisions relevant to some of the points raised by the complainants. Section  of the Decree lays down certain rules with regard to elections which must be embodied in the by-laws of trade unions. As concerns electoral rolls, section  (d) stipulates that they must be made available to members and to candidates for office not less than  days prior to the date of the election. As for the places where the votes may be cast, section  (b) states that these must be specified in the notice of election and may not be changed.
.Furthermore, the Committee noted the Government's observations to the effect that no allegations of electoral fraud had been made. In this respect the Committee pointed out that it had stated on many occasions that, while in view of the nature of its responsibilities it could not consider itself bound by the rule, normally applicable in international jurisdictions, that national procedures of redress must be utilised in the first instance, it must have regard, however, in examining the merits of a case, to the fact that a national remedy before an independent tribunal, whose procedure offered appropriate guarantees, had not been pursued.
.In conclusion, the Committee recommended that the Government be requested: (a) to supply information concerning the administrative and judicial avenues open to the trade unionists involved in the present case whereby they could appeal against the decisions of the controller as regards the elections that had been held; (b) to forward its observations and comments on the points mentioned in paragraphs  and  above.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that the leaflets sent to the Committee by the complainants do not constitute authentic proof and that the electoral meeting and last ballot undertaken in the Chemical and Allied Workers' Union were entirely normal and gave rise to no objections. The Committee understands that this refers to the primary elections mentioned by the complainants. The Government goes on to say that only one list of candidates was presented at the elections since the other lists, which had been officially approved, were withdrawn. Voting was secret and the Government gives the addresses of the places in which the  voting booths were installed. There were , names on the electoral roll and , persons voted. The list presented obtained , votes. Twenty-one votes were declared null and void and there were  blank votes. The Government adds that the leaflets sent to the ILO by the complainants are self-contradictory since, while one of them denounces irregularities, a subsequent one calls upon members to take part in the elections (which implies that the alleged irregularities had been made good) and that, lastly, one day before the elections began, a further leaflet called for non-participation in the elections.
.In its communication of  August , the Government explains that the decisions taken by the government-appointed controller of an occupational association, as regards elections held therein, may be challenged if they contravene the provisions of the association's by-laws. Such decisions may be appealed against to the controller's hierarchical superiors (in accordance with Decree No. /). Moreover, recourse may always be had to court proceedings by any person who considers that his legitimate rights and interests have been abused. In cases where prompt and efficacious intervention is required to ensure the effective application of the guarantees embodied in the Constitution, the persons concerned may avail themselves of the amparo procedure to secure respect of a fundamental right (Act No. ). The Government explains that this was the interpretation given by the Supreme Court of Justice when it ruled that "" where acts already committed by administrative authorities constitute a present or imminent threat of actual harm, there are grounds for seeking the protection of the courts "".
.The Committee observes that the further communications sent by the Government contain no specific information regarding the complainants' allegations, mentioned in paragraph , or the relevant legislative provisions, referred to in paragraph . The Government confines itself to pointing out that the fact that in one of the trade union leaflets members were urged to participate in the voting implies that the irregularities denounced by the trade union concerned, in a previous leaflet, had been remedied. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that in the final leaflet, calling upon workers not to take part in the elections, the reasons given are the alleged irregularities",0,1970,Argentina
359,"referred to in paragraph  above. Two of these irregularities would constitute infringements of the provisions of Decree No.  of  (see paragraph  above). The Committee consequently considers that, because of the lack of precision and detail in the information sent by the Government, it is impossible to throw sufficient light on the events complained about in this case. Nor is the Committee in a position to judge the extent to which the alleged irregularities would have rendered the electoral process fraudulent. In any case, they appear to have led to the withdrawal of various lists of candidates so that the trade union election could not be held in completely normal conditions. Moreover, the Committee observes that less than half of those who were entitled to vote actually did so.
.The Committee considers it necessary to recall that the elections took place while the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers (to which the Chemical and Allied Workers' Union is affiliated) was under Government control and that the elections were organised by the official from the Secretariat of State for Labour who was acting as controller. The Committee has frequently had occasion to express its opinion (restated in paragraph  above) with regard to the taking over of trade unions by public authorities. As regards measures that can be taken by government-appointed controllers in the exercise of their functions, the Committee considers that these are liable to appear arbitrary, even though they may be called in question before the courts. This is why the Committee has repeatedly pointed out that, although the principles established in Article  of Convention No.  do not prevent the control of internal acts of a trade union, if it is considered that such acts constitute a breach of legal or statutory provisions, it is of the utmost importance, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, for such control to be exercised by the relevant judicial authority. This would avoid the risk to the free exercise of trade union rights caused by any type of administrative takeover of trade unions.
.On the other hand, the Committee observes that the decisions taken by the government-appointed controller could have been appealed against in the courts in order to clarify the matters raised by the persons involved and, in view of the circumstances, to provide a timely remedy to any proved irregularity, but that the persons concerned did not avail themselves of this possibility.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret the fact that the Government has not sent precise information regarding the allegations made by the complainants of irregularities in trade union elections;(b) to note that the persons concerned did not avail themselves in this case of their right of appeal to the judicial authorities to oppose the measures alleged to have affected them in the electoral procedure;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above as regards the specific question of trade union elections and the more general problem of the taking over of trade unions by the administrative authorities.
.The complaint of the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers is contained in a communication dated  June . It was brought to the attention of the Government, which forwarded its observations by a communication dated  October .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants begin by referring to an earlier complaint examined by the Committee, which related to the taking over by the Government, ordered in January , of the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers. The Committee recommended the Governing Body in connection with that case "" to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to restore the trade union organisation in question to normal as soon as possible "".
.The complainants go on to say that no action has been taken to this effect, and that the authorities have forcibly handed over the management of the Federation to pro-government collaborators. The General Secretary of the Federation, who had been arrested in July , was released only after mass demonstrations and a strike. According to the complaint, the leaders imposed upon the Federation by the authorities organised rigged elections at the end of November . The electoral committee, composed of people who had no connection with the Federation, displayed no list of candidates and even refused to allow the ballot boxes to be kept on the Federation's premises as was customary. In view of these facts, allege the complainants, the Federation's members abstained from voting in large numbers.
.The complaint concludes with the statement that the last collective agreement was signed on behalf of the Federation by government officials.
.In its reply the Government, referring to the General Secretary of the Federation, mentioned above, declares that he was arrested on account of activities presumed to be of subversive nature, and subsequently released.
.As regards the elections held within the Federation, the Government states that there was no electoral committee and that no allegations were made of electoral fraud. The controller in charge of the taking over of the organisation, an official of the Secretariat of State for Labour, called for elections on  February , and at the Congress held a month later the Federation's new leaders were elected. They took office on  March . A single list of candidates was submitted to the Congress, and obtained  votes from the  delegates present.
.As concerns the collective agreement to which the complainants refer, the Government explains that under Decree No. / a timetable was laid down for the renewal of collective agreements, that for the chemical industries being due for renewal in December . Since at that time the Federation was under government control, the Secretary of State for Labour designated the controller and two other persons to negotiate on its behalf, since otherwise the agreement in force would have been renewed without any possibility of securing better working conditions.
.The Committee observes that the procedure whereby the leaders of the Federation were elected did not reach its culmination until two years after the taking over of this organisation by the public authorities, with the result that when the time came for the renewal of the collective agreement (towards the end of this period), the workers' representatives had to be designated by the Secretariat of State for Labour, and included the controller himself-an official of the Secretariat. The Committee considers it necessary to emphasise in this respect the importance it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which lays down that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.As regards the elections held within the Federation, the Committee takes note of the Government's observation to the effect that no allegations of electoral fraud were made at the time. The Committee has pointed out on many occasions that, while in view of the nature of its responsibilities it cannot consider itself bound by any rule that national procedures of redress must be exhausted, such as applies, for instance, to international claims tribunals, it must have regard in examining the merits of a case, to the fact that a national remedy before an independent tribunal whose procedure offers appropriate guarantees has not been pursued.
.The Committee observes that in their account of the events in question the complainants refer to what appear to have been primary elections held in November  for the purpose of electing delegates to the Congress which was to have the actual task of electing the leaders of the Federation. The Government supplies certain details about this Congress, but apart from stating that there was no electoral committee, it makes no comment upon the remaining assertions of the complainants with regard to these primary elections, which concern alleged irregularities in regard to the displaying of a list of candidates and the custody of the ballot boxes.

.The Committee recalls Decree No.  of , which was apparently in force at the time of the elections, and which contains certain provisions relevant to some of the points raised by the complainants.

.In order to be in possession of sufficient evidence on which to base its conclusions in regard to this case, the Committee would like to have the Government's observations and comments on the points mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which lays down that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to supply information concerning the administrative and judicial avenues which were open to the trade unionists involved in the present case enabling them to appeal against the decisions of the controller concerning the elections in question;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations and comments on the points mentioned in paragraphs  and  above;(d) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report again as soon as it is in possession of the information, observations and comments to which reference is made in this paragraph.Geneva,  February  (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1970,Argentina
361,".These cases last came before the Committee at its February  session, when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which is to be found in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.In subparagraph (c) of paragraph  the Committee made certain recommendations to the Governing Body in regard to the allegations still pending, namely that the Government of Argentina be requested to supply information and observations concerning the alleged kidnapping of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro, the death of Mr. Emilio Juregui and the measures of anti-trade union discrimination said to have been taken against Mr. Carlos Bongiovani.
.The Argentinian Government has forwarded its observations by letters dated  May and  August .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee earlier examined certain allegations by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) according to which Mr. Ongaro, on his way to take part in a public meeting in Tucumn province in January , had been kidnapped by naval and police personnel and taken to a naval base near the city of Bahia Blanca, some , kilometres away from the place where he was arrested, and then released. In reply to these allegations the Government had denied the alleged kidnapping, pointing in evidence to the dismissal of the case by a judge on  April , and explaining that Mr. Ongaro had been invited by the police authorities not to continue his journey to Tucumn as it was feared that extremist elements would make use of his presence to cause disturbances, and had himself asked to be taken back.
.In view of the discrepancy between the two versions, the Committee at that time recommended that the Government be requested to forward the text of the court decision to which it had referred, together with the reasons (paragraph  (d) of the Committee's th Report). The Committee repeated this request at its February  session.
.In its communication of  May  the Government merely repeats that there never was any kidnapping.
.The Committee also examined a complaint by the WCL that Mr. Emilio Juregui had been murdered by the Argentinian police in a public street on  June . As the Government had not submitted its observations on that allegation, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask for information from the Government as to what action had been taken in order to clarify the matter and on any results of such investigations (paragraph  (f) (ii) of the Committee's th Report). This recommendation was also repeated by the Committee at its February  session.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that the death of Mr. Juregui occurred during disturbances in Buenos Aires, and that the facts of the case have been communicated to the competent judicial authority. According to the Government Mr. Juregui was neither a trade union official nor a worker, and in view of the circumstances in which he met his death-during a street scuffle-the Government considers that it is not within the Committee's competence to concern itself with this aspect of the complaint.
.Lastly, the Committee examined a complaint presented on  November  by the WCL that Mr. Carlos Bongiovani, shop steward for the "" Consumer Routes "" (Rutas de Consumidores) section, had been suspended from his employment on account of his trade union activities. The Government, having been informed of this complaint, states in its communications of  May and  August  that it has no information about the person in question and that the National Industrial Relations Tribunal, a tripartite body which is competent to deal with all matters relating to the dismissal or suspension from employment of trade union representatives or modifications in their conditions of employment, has no record of this case either.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the kidnapping of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro, the Committee regrets that the Government has not forwarded, as requested, the text of the court decision, which would have furnished fresh evidence to assist the Committee in reaching its conclusions. As matters stand, in view of the time that has elapsed since the events in question are alleged to have taken place and the fact that no attempt was made to keep Mr. Ongaro in custody as a result of these events, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by examining this aspect of the case further.
.With regard to the allegations relating to Mr. Emilio Juregui and Mr. Carlos Bongiovani, the Committee takes note of the Government's observations, and in view of the lack of detailed information from the complainants concerning the persons in question and the circumstances in which the alleged events occurred, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that these aspects of the case do not call for further examination.
.The Committee examined these cases at its session in November , when it submitted an interim report (paragraphs  to  of its th Report) which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (- November ).
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee submitted to the Governing Body a number of recommendations, some for the purpose of inviting the Argentine Government to send certain information in order that consideration of the corresponding allegations might be pursued. The Government sent further information in its communication dated  November , and the World Confederation of Labour submitted further allegations in a communication dated  November , relating to one of the aspects of the case, which were communicated to the Government. The recommendations formulated by the Committee were communicated to the Government, which replied in communications dated  December .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With respect to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) concerning the allegations relating to the conviction of Mr. Elpidio Torres and other trade unionists by military tribunals, and the detention of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro and other trade unionists, to take note of the fact that the detainees have been released under the Act of Amnesty and other measures taken in this connection and to express its satisfaction that, according to the Government's statement, these measures make it quite certain that there are no trade union leaders deprived of their freedom anywhere in the country;(b) concerning the allegations relating to the appointment of a Government delegate to the CGT, to take note of the formation of the National Reorganising and Normalising Committee of the CGT, composed exclusively of trade union representatives, and to note that the functions of the Government delegate have been brought to an end; and to express the hope that trade union elections will be held as soon as possible, in conformity with the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, which recognises the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives freely, without interference by the public authorities;(c) concerning the remaining allegations pending, to ask the Government once more to send, as soon as possible, the information previously requested regarding the allegations concerning the kidnapping of Mr. Ongaro and the death of Mr. Emilio Juregui, and to be good enough to formulate its observations on the allegation regarding the measures of anti-trade-union discrimination taken against Mr. Carlos Bongiovani-it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received this information.
.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these three cases, which are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegations, were contained in seven communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) (dated  January,  May,  April,  May,  July,  July and  August ), two communications from the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF) (dated  June and  July ), one communication from the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) (dated  July ), one communication from Argentine Trade Union Action (ASA) (dated  July ), two communications from the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers (dated  and  August ) and one communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) (dated  August ).

.With regard to all these cases, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) concerning the allegations regarding the arrest of the General",1,1969,Argentina

365,".The Committee considered Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , February, May and November  and March , when it submitted to the Governing Body the reports contained, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report, all of which were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its th Report the Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body in respect of the various allegations examined, in the following terms:
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the detention of the trade union official, Eustaquio Tolosa, to express its satisfaction at the decision to reduce his sentence, a decision in which the Committee's conclusions were taken into account, and the fact that Mr. Tolosa has now been released;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed and the repeated requests made to it, the Government has not yet brought to an end those measures to take over unions which were still in force, and to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to interference by the authorities in the affairs of the CGT, measures directed against union leaders and members and compulsory arbitration and collective bargaining:(i) to regret the failure on a number of occasions to supply the information requested on which the Committee was relying in order to formulate its conclusions on the said allegations with a full knowledge of the facts;(ii) to draw the Government's attention once more to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which states that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, while the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise; and to the principle laid down in Article  of the Convention that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations; and that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, the Government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, this restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.These conclusions were transmitted to the Government, which supplied information in three communications dated  May,  September and  October .
.In the meantime, the International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions had sent a communication dated  February  containing allegations of infringement of trade union rights in Argentina in connection with collective bargaining. The Government has not yet forwarded its observations on this complaint, which has been recorded as Case No. . Since the allegations relate to one of the aspects examined in Case No. , the Committee has decided to amalgamate the two cases and deal with them together.
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).Allegations relating to Measures to Take Over Various Trade Union Organisations and to Suspend Their Trade Union Status
.At its session in March  the Committee referred to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status which it had examined at earlier sessions. The Committee recalled on this occasion the Act of the Argentine Revolution concerning the taking over of trade unions and the various statements by the Government to the effect that it was hastening the process of a return to normal in the trade union movement, and drew attention to the time which had elapsed since the taking over of the unions still deprived of their status and to the importance of such a return to normal if these organisations were to exercise their rights under Convention No.  to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.The Committee had before it a communication dated  January  from the Government in which it indicated that the basis for the measures to take over trade unions was the need to promote the process of reorganisation of the unions concerned and their return to a normal situation in accordance with the aims pursued by the Government of the Argentine Revolution. The letter went on to say that all the organisations taken over had been engaging in activities outside their powers. As their voting lists were restored to normal, the Government intended to call elections and allow the unions to revert to their normal operation. The Government again stated, as it had done to the Committee on previous occasions, that these measures were not directed against the exercise of trade union rights. On the contrary, the Government hoped to count on the participation of the workers in the task of reconstructing the country. But if this participation was to be effective and fruitful, the unions must abide by the law and carry out specifically occupational activities, and their leaders must be genuinely representative. Accordingly, it was of cardinal importance that such organisations should bring their Constitutions into line with the legislation in force. The Government concluded by stating that it would keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over.
.At its meeting in May  the Committee had already pointed out that in some cases the Government had lifted the suspension of the status of certain unions, such as the Textile Workers' Union and the Metal Workers' Union, but it had not done so in the case of other unions which had been deprived of their status at the same time and for the same reason.
.The Government has appended to its communications of  September and  October  copies of Resolutions Nos.  and  of  August , restoring the trade union status of the Telephone and Telecommunications Workers' Union of the Republic of Argentina (FOETRA) and annulling the suspension of the trade union status of the Buenos Aires branch of that Federation, and a copy of Resolution No.  restoring the trade union status of the Tucumn Sugar Industry Workers' Union (FOTIA).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the measures taken in respect of the trade union organisations mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and to urge the Government once again to lift the suspension of the trade union status and end the takeover of the unions still affected, and to keep the Committee informed in this respect.Allegations relating to Collective Bargaining and Compulsory Arbitration
.At its session in November  the Committee examined a number of allegations made by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions to the effect that Act No.  of  respecting compulsory arbitration eliminated the right to strike and the provisions of Act No.  that respected collective agreements and violated the relevant international standards. The General Confederation of Labour of the Argentine Republic had mentioned the same Act in its communication. The FOETRA, for its part, had stated that by virtue of Act No.  referring to private concerns, and Act No.  referring to the public sector, "" the joint agreements on collective bargaining have been abolished "".
.With regard to Act No.  respecting compulsory arbitration, the Government, which had supplied the text, had explained that the Act owed its existence to the need to seek appropriate formulae to settle labour disputes that might affect vital national interests and delay the process of recovery to which the Argentine Revolution was committed. As for Act No. , the Government had denied that it constituted a violation of freedom of association and stated that its purpose was to harmonise and co-ordinate the economic recovery of the country and at the same time to ensure the workers a genuine wage by means of graded increases fitting in with the",2,1969,Argentina
366,"dates of expiry of the various collective agreements.
.The Committee observed that the legal provisions in question appeared to raise questions that should be examined in the light of certain generally recognised principles respecting freedom of association and, in any case, in the light of that contained in Article  of Convention No. -ratified by Argentina-to the effect that "" measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". The Committee, observed, however, that the provisions of Act No.  were intended to remain in force only until  December .
.In view of the fact that the observations of the Government had been expressed in general terms and concerned only part of the allegations relating to collective bargaining, the Committee postponed consideration of these allegations and requested the Government to be good enough to report on specific cases in which Act No.  was applied, and also to send the text of Acts Nos.  and .
.With its communication of  February , the International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions, acting on behalf of its affiliated organisation, the Glass and Allied Industries Trade Union of Argentina (Sindicato Obrero de la Industria del Vidrio y Afines de la Argentina) forwarded the text of Act No.  of , alleging that the Government was prohibiting collective bargaining, in violation of Act No.  respecting collective agreements and ILO Convention No. . Under the terms of Act No.  a general wage increase was granted, the collective agreements in force were extended until  December  and Acts Nos.  and  were ordered to remain in force until the same date.
.The Government supplied the information requested of it on  May . According to its communication, Act No.  provided for increases in the basic remuneration established by the collective agreements due to expire in  and kept the agreements in force until  December . This Act, according to the Government, formed an instrument of economic policy to supplement the other measures adopted in the field of budgets, taxation, exchange, customs and finance with a view to the urgent stopping of the inflationary spiral. Act No.  was an emergency measure adopted in view of the prevailing economic situation. The Government went on to state that the Act in question had been replaced by Act No.  of  December , in order to prolong the emergency rules made necessary by the economic conditions the country was going through. The new Act maintained the temporary suspension of the system of concluding collective agreements-which would be re-established as soon as the Act expired on  December -and provided for a general increase in wages.
.With regard to Act No.  the Government states that under it a Technical Advisory Commission on Wage Policy had been set up to be responsible for the study, analysis and assessment of measures to establish a co-ordinated and harmonious wage policy with respect to the central administration, state undertakings, decentralised bodies and private public service undertakings covering the whole national territory or whose activities exceeded the boundaries of a province. Every plan for modifying the pay of the staff of the above-mentioned establishments must be submitted in advance to this Commission, which would issue the instructions to be followed with respect thereto.
.As for the application in practice of Act No.  respecting compulsory arbitration, the Government stated that arbitration awards had been issued in four cases, concerning commercial employees, textile workers, tram workers and workers in the meat industry.
.The Government concluded by declaring that all these Acts are emergency measures whose sole effect had been a temporary suspension of collective bargaining in regard to the fixing of wages. It was the Government's intention to re-establish the system of Act No.  respecting collective agreements as soon as economic conditions permitted. In the Government's view the legislation referred to above did not infringe either Convention No.  or any principle connected with freedom of association.
.Since this communication from the Government further legislative provisions in this connection have been enacted and have been brought to the Committee's knowledge. Mention may be made first of all of Decree No.  of  August  and Act No.  of  September . These texts authorise the re-negotiation of the collective agreements kept in force under Acts Nos.  and . The agreements re-negotiated in accordance with these provisions shall remain in force from  January  to  December . The negotiations must be completed within  days. If agreement cannot be reached, the authority may refer the matter to compulsory arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Act No. , which is now to remain in force until  December . While this Act provides that the parties may be compelled to go to arbitration where the dispute "" is of such a character as to affect the economic activity, productivity, development and progress of the nation and/or the security and well-being of the community "", these terms are so broad that they give the impression that the authority can submit to arbitration practically all cases in which it has not been possible to reach agreement.
.The Committee has also taken note of the enactment of other provisions relevant to the same subject. Act No. , already mentioned, provides for a certain increase in the prevailing minimum living wage, and Decree No.  of  September  does the same with respect to various family allowances. Act No.  of  September  prohibits the reflection in prices of higher costs resulting from the negotiation of new collective agreements, except in certain cases. Lastly, Decree No.  of the same date provides for the setting up of a National Prices and Wages Advisory Board, tripartite in composition, and with advisory and informatory functions, which will be required to publish an annual report analysing and forecasting trends in prices and wages.
.The Government has more recently, on  October , introduced further measures affecting collective bargaining. Acts Nos.  and , promulgated on that date, grant a general increase in the pay of all workers in private employment from  November  and provide for a further increase from I March , to remain in effect until  December . The Government may readjust pay rates from  January  if there is evidence of a decline in the value of real earnings, to be determined on the basis of the annual report to be submitted by the National Prices and Wages Advisory Board. Collective bargaining must exclude all matters pertaining to the fixing of wages. The wage increases granted must not be reflected in prices, with certain exceptions.
.The Committee observes that, according to the Government's declarations, the restrictive measures adopted in respect of collective bargaining are emergency measures and the resultant suspension of the provisions of Act No.  respecting collective agreements is only temporary. From the terms of the more recent legislation it is evident that these too are temporary measures, although it is worthy of comment that the restrictions imposed on collective bargaining as far as wages are concerned are to remain in force for a prolonged period lasting until the end of .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while taking note of the legislation enacted by the Government with respect to collective bargaining, as well as of the temporary and emergency nature this legislation is said to have, to reaffirm that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations. Furthermore, in view of the implications for the standard of living of the workers of the fixing of wages by the Government, by-passing the collective bargaining process, and of the Government's wage policy in general, the Committee also recommends the Governing Body to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the promotion of effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and workers' organisations in this respect, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), for the purpose of considering jointly matters of mutual concern with a view to arriving, to the fullest possible extent, at agreed solutions.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to measures to take over various trade union organisations and to suspend their trade union status:(i) to take note of the measures taken to restore the trade union status of the Telephone and Telecommunications Workers' Union of the Republic of Argentina (FOETRA) and the Tucumn Sugar Industry Workers' Union (FOTIA) and annulling the suspension of the trade union status of the Buenos Aires branch of that Federation;(ii)",0,1969,Argentina
367,"to urge the Government once again to lift the suspension of the trade union status and end the takeover of the unions still affected, and to keep the Committee informed in this respect;(b) as regards the allegations relating to collective bargaining and compulsory arbitration:(i) while taking note of the legislation enacted by the Government with respect to collective bargaining, as well as the temporary and emergency nature this legislation is said to have, to reaffirm that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations;(ii) in view of the implications for the standard of living of the workers of the fixing of wages by the Government, by-passing the collective bargaining process, and of the Government's wage policy in general, to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the promotion of effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and workers' and employers' organisations in this respect, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), for the purpose of considering jointly matters of mutual concern with a view to arriving, to the fullest possible extent, at agreed solutions.",4,1969,Argentina
368,".These cases last came before the Committee at its February  session, when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which is to be found in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.In subparagraph (c) of paragraph  the Committee made certain recommendations to the Governing Body in regard to the allegations still pending, namely that the Government of Argentina be requested to supply information and observations concerning the alleged kidnapping of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro, the death of Mr. Emilio Juregui and the measures of anti-trade union discrimination said to have been taken against Mr. Carlos Bongiovani.
.The Argentinian Government has forwarded its observations by letters dated  May and  August .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee earlier examined certain allegations by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) according to which Mr. Ongaro, on his way to take part in a public meeting in Tucumn province in January , had been kidnapped by naval and police personnel and taken to a naval base near the city of Bahia Blanca, some , kilometres away from the place where he was arrested, and then released. In reply to these allegations the Government had denied the alleged kidnapping, pointing in evidence to the dismissal of the case by a judge on  April , and explaining that Mr. Ongaro had been invited by the police authorities not to continue his journey to Tucumn as it was feared that extremist elements would make use of his presence to cause disturbances, and had himself asked to be taken back.
.In view of the discrepancy between the two versions, the Committee at that time recommended that the Government be requested to forward the text of the court decision to which it had referred, together with the reasons (paragraph  (d) of the Committee's th Report). The Committee repeated this request at its February  session.
.In its communication of  May  the Government merely repeats that there never was any kidnapping.
.The Committee also examined a complaint by the WCL that Mr. Emilio Juregui had been murdered by the Argentinian police in a public street on  June . As the Government had not submitted its observations on that allegation, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask for information from the Government as to what action had been taken in order to clarify the matter and on any results of such investigations (paragraph  (f) (ii) of the Committee's th Report). This recommendation was also repeated by the Committee at its February  session.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that the death of Mr. Juregui occurred during disturbances in Buenos Aires, and that the facts of the case have been communicated to the competent judicial authority. According to the Government Mr. Juregui was neither a trade union official nor a worker, and in view of the circumstances in which he met his death-during a street scuffle-the Government considers that it is not within the Committee's competence to concern itself with this aspect of the complaint.
.Lastly, the Committee examined a complaint presented on  November  by the WCL that Mr. Carlos Bongiovani, shop steward for the "" Consumer Routes "" (Rutas de Consumidores) section, had been suspended from his employment on account of his trade union activities. The Government, having been informed of this complaint, states in its communications of  May and  August  that it has no information about the person in question and that the National Industrial Relations Tribunal, a tripartite body which is competent to deal with all matters relating to the dismissal or suspension from employment of trade union representatives or modifications in their conditions of employment, has no record of this case either.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the kidnapping of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro, the Committee regrets that the Government has not forwarded, as requested, the text of the court decision, which would have furnished fresh evidence to assist the Committee in reaching its conclusions. As matters stand, in view of the time that has elapsed since the events in question are alleged to have taken place and the fact that no attempt was made to keep Mr. Ongaro in custody as a result of these events, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by examining this aspect of the case further.
.With regard to the allegations relating to Mr. Emilio Juregui and Mr. Carlos Bongiovani, the Committee takes note of the Government's observations, and in view of the lack of detailed information from the complainants concerning the persons in question and the circumstances in which the alleged events occurred, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that these aspects of the case do not call for further examination.
.The Committee examined these cases at its session in November , when it submitted an interim report (paragraphs  to  of its th Report) which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (- November ).
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee submitted to the Governing Body a number of recommendations, some for the purpose of inviting the Argentine Government to send certain information in order that consideration of the corresponding allegations might be pursued. The Government sent further information in its communication dated  November , and the World Confederation of Labour submitted further allegations in a communication dated  November , relating to one of the aspects of the case, which were communicated to the Government. The recommendations formulated by the Committee were communicated to the Government, which replied in communications dated  December .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With respect to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) concerning the allegations relating to the conviction of Mr. Elpidio Torres and other trade unionists by military tribunals, and the detention of Mr. Raimundo Ongaro and other trade unionists, to take note of the fact that the detainees have been released under the Act of Amnesty and other measures taken in this connection and to express its satisfaction that, according to the Government's statement, these measures make it quite certain that there are no trade union leaders deprived of their freedom anywhere in the country;(b) concerning the allegations relating to the appointment of a Government delegate to the CGT, to take note of the formation of the National Reorganising and Normalising Committee of the CGT, composed exclusively of trade union representatives, and to note that the functions of the Government delegate have been brought to an end; and to express the hope that trade union elections will be held as soon as possible, in conformity with the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, which recognises the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives freely, without interference by the public authorities;(c) concerning the remaining allegations pending, to ask the Government once more to send, as soon as possible, the information previously requested regarding the allegations concerning the kidnapping of Mr. Ongaro and the death of Mr. Emilio Juregui, and to be good enough to formulate its observations on the allegation regarding the measures of anti-trade-union discrimination taken against Mr. Carlos Bongiovani-it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received this information.
.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these three cases, which are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegations, were contained in seven communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) (dated  January,  May,  April,  May,  July,  July and  August ), two communications from the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF) (dated  June and  July ), one communication from the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) (dated  July ), one communication from Argentine Trade Union Action (ASA) (dated  July ), two communications from the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers (dated  and  August ) and one communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) (dated  August ).
.As these communications were received, they were forwarded to the Government for its observations. These were received in four letters dated  May and ,  and  September  from the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic to the International Organisations in Geneva.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to all these cases, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) concerning the allegations regarding the arrest of the General",1,1969,Argentina

370,".The complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) is contained in two communications dated  May and  July  and the complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Transport Workers (I.F.C.T.U.T.W.) in a communication dated  May .Copies of these communications were sent to the Government, which presented its observations through the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Argentina to the International Organisations in Geneva on  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its first communication the I.F.C.T.U requested the I.L.O. to intervene on account of the many arrests carried out by the Argentine authorities during the May Day demonstrations. Three Christian trade union officers were said to be among the persons arrested. In its second communication the I.F.C.T.U complained of the imprisonment of Mr. Julio Guilln and other officers of the Argentine General Confederation of Labour. The I.F.C.T.U.T.W also referred to the arrest of a large number of those taking part in the May Day demonstrations and mentioned by name Mr. Carlos Custer, Mr. Emilio Valenti, and Mr. Juan Carlos Loureiro. Both organisations maintained that through these measures the Argentine Government had violated the International Labour Conventions on freedom of association.
.In its reply the Government refers only to the two communications of the I.F.C.T.U and states that the arrests of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaint were carried out as a result of their participation with other active members in the disorders occurring on  May and  June  in connection with unauthorised public activities. The arrests were carried out to safeguard public order, and "" all those arrested were soon restored to liberty "". The Government declares that measures of this kind cannot be confused with the infringement of trade union rights and encloses a copy of the police regulations on disorders.
.In earlier cases the Committee has considered that the right to organise public meetings, particularly on May Day, is an important aspect of trade union rights, The Committee has also considered, however, that it rests with the Government, which is responsible for the maintenance of public order, to decide in the exercise of its police powers whether meetings, including trade union meetings, may in certain special circumstances endanger public order and security, and to take adequate preventive measures.
.In the present case it appears from the communication of the Government that the persons referred to in the complaints were arrested for participation in disorders arising in connection with certain unauthorised public activities. The persons were not prosecuted on these grounds, however, and they were soon restored to liberty. The Committee understands that these persons included the trade unionists mentioned by name in the I.F.C.T.U.T.W complaint, since the Government states that all those arrested during the May Day disorders have been released.
.In these circumstances, and subject to the principles expressed in paragraph  above, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the present case does not call for further examination.",-1,1968,Argentina
371,".This case was previously examined by the Committee at its session in November , when it formulated its definitive conclusions thereon. These are contained in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report and will be submitted for the approval of the Governing Body at its th Session.
.Since the November session of the Committee, however, the Government, in a communication dated  January , has presented a new series of observations which call for examination.
.The case consisted essentially of allegations that the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers had been deprived of its trade union status and had been placed under the control of the Government. In its observations the Government stated that the reason for taking over this organisation was that it had participated in the "" Action Plan "" of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), the purpose of which was to challenge certain political decisions of the Government, and that in doing so it had departed from the trade union aims for which it had been set up.
.At its session in November  the Committee noted that the taking over of trade union organisations implied the serious danger of a restriction of the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, and it recommended the Governing Body, firstly, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, which provides that workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, and, secondly, to stress the importance of the principle set forth in Article  of Convention No. , to the effect that workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority.
.In its communication of  January  the Government again states that the taking over of the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers was due to the fact that this Organisation had departed from its trade union purpose to engage in activities of a political nature. The Government further states that the aim pursued in taking over an organisation is to restore to normal the situation of the organisation in question, and to regularise its operation in order that trade union elections may be held as soon as possible.
.The Government also states that such action does not have the effect of infringing the right of organisations to elect their representatives, to organise their administration or to formulate their programmes, to the extent that these organisations act in accordance with the specifically trade union objectives which justify their existence.
.Having noted these new observations by the Government, the Committee considers that they contain nothing to justify it in altering the conclusions it reached following its previous examination of the case, as contained in its th Report.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to confirm the conclusions contained in paragraph  (b) of the Committee's th Report;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to keep the Governing Body informed of any measures taken with a view to the return to a normal situation of the organisation mentioned in the complaint, stating in particular whether it has been possible for free elections to be held.
.The complaint of the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers is contained in a communication dated  April . A copy of this was sent to the Government, which replied on  September  through the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Argentina to the International Organisations in Geneva.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state in their communication that the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers has been the victim of an infringement of trade union rights by the Argentine Government. On  January  its premises were occupied by the police. As a result of this action, there were protests in various parts of the country, strikes were declared, and a meeting was held at which the officers of the Federation were unanimously confirmed in office. Nevertheless, the Government continued its repressive measures, the officers of the union were suspended, various active members were dismissed and the funds of the Federation were frozen. In this way the General Secretary of the Federation, who is also Vice-President of the complainant organisation, was prevented from carrying on his trade union duties in the country. The complainants protested to the President of the Republic of Argentina, asking him to take action to ensure that the rights of the Federation were respected, and in their complaint they urge that the Government should be called on to guarantee the exercise of the rights laid down in the international Conventions and to take the necessary measures to permit the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers and its officers to carry on their activities in full freedom.
.The Government states in its reply that the action complained of was ordered with a view to maintaining national security, internal order and social peace, since the Federation in question had taken part in the so-called "" Action Plan "" of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), the purpose of which was to challenge political decisions of the Government, a purpose implying the carrying on of an activity that was not specifically that of a trade union. The Government continues by stating that it has an obligation to ensure the observance of the legal provisions governing the operation of trade union organisations, having at its disposal the necessary means to put right any deviations that may arise. In the case in question, there had been a series of circumstances that, in the opinion of the Government, compelled it to bring trade union activities back to normal. Political decisions intended to guarantee the proper observance of trade union rights and obligations could not be called in question. At all events, the Government maintains, it is its aim to restore the trade union organisation in question to normal as soon as possible. The Government concludes that there has been no infringement of individual liberty and that the social and provident services of the organisation are being carried on regularly and efficiently.
.The Committee recalls that, when examining Case No.  concerning Argentina in its st Report, it observed that the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers and other trade union organisations had had their trade union status suspended by resolution No.  of  March . The measure had been taken as a result of the Action Plan prepared by the CGT, which affected national security, and on account of the succession of direct measures carried out by various trade union organisations without the observance of the legal requirements which, in some cases, showed a disruptive intention incompatible with the legitimate exercise of trade union rights. The Government had subsequently indicated, through a letter dated  September , that Ministerial Resolution No.  of  had rescinded ""the taking over of the unions of the chemical industry "".
.The present complaint relates to incidents subsequent to those mentioned above, since the complainants give specific indications concerning a series of acts that started on  January . The Government, in its reply, does not deny the statements made in the complaint, and confines itself to justifying the measures adopted and referring to the participation of the Federation in the Action Plan. In other words, the Government appears to refer to acts that occurred long ago in connection with which the taking over of the Federation had been ordered and later rescinded.
.However this may be, the Committee observes that the question now at issue is a new taking over of a trade union organisation by the Argentine Government. The Committee has already pointed out that on many occasions it has had to examine the question of the taking over of trade union organisations in Argentina. On these occasions, the Committee has drawn the attention of the Government to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which provides that workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference that would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee has also drawn attention to the fact that the taking over of trade union organisations implies the serious danger of a restriction of the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities. The",-1,1968,Argentina
372,"Committee has also pointed out the importance of the principle contained in Article  of the Convention in question to the effect that workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority.
.The Committee recalls that, when examining Case No.  at its meeting in May , it reached the conclusion that the Government should again be urged to repeal as soon as possible any measures still in force to suspend or take over trade unions and requested the Government to keep it informed of any measures it has taken or proposes to take to this end.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to point out to the Argentine Government that the information in its reply tending to justify the measures taken against the Argentine Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers does not appear to correspond to the specific facts mentioned in the complaint;(b) since the question raised is in any case the taking over of a trade union organisation by the Argentine Government, to draw the attention of the Government once more to the principles set forth in paragraph  above and particularly to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Argentina, to the effect that workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(c) to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to restore the trade union organisation in question to normal as soon as possible, and to request the Government to keep it informed of any measures adopted to this end.",-1,1968,Argentina
373,".The Committee examined this case previously in its session in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body a report which is contained in paragraphs - of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ).
.The Committee had reached a number of final conclusions on the complaint submitted by the United Unions of Workers in the State Oil Industry, contained in paragraph  of its th Report. After this Report had been communicated to the Government and to the complainants, the latter sent a further communication on  July , in which they made observations on specific aspects of the case. After the Government had been informed of those parts of the communication which contained new points concerning the exercise of trade union rights, it furnished its comments in a letter dated  November .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its observations on the original complaint presented by the complainants, the Government had stated (see paragraph  of the th Report) that its respect for Convention No.  had been demonstrated by its promulgation of Act No.  of  (respecting the organisation of labour in state undertakings), which provided for the introduction of methods and systems of rationalisation with the participation of the unions. As a result of this Act, the Government stated, the organisations concerned played a direct part in rationalising state undertakings, and it was the United Unions of Workers in the State Oil Industry which had signed the first rationalisation agreement under the terms of the Act. In its conclusions the Committee recommended the Governing Body to take note of this fact.
.In their subsequent communication, the complainants stated that the effect of Act No.  was to compel the unions of workers in state undertakings to discuss changes in the existing systems of work, to impose the agenda for negotiations and to reserve for the Government the right to arbitrate without benefit of appeal. Any unions which refused to discuss work systems on the terms laid down in the Act would be obliged to accept regulations drawn up unilaterally by the Secretary of State for Labour, "" all of which constitutes a further infringement of Convention No.  "". The complainants add that Act No.  is a coercive measure since it does not allow collective bargaining to take its natural course. They point out that "" in the atmosphere of social disquiet existing in our country, and having no legal support whatsoever, our organisation chose the lesser evil, that is to say of going to the conference table as provided under Act No. , in the hope of avoiding a unilateral enforcement of a system of work which, by any standards, would be aimed at undermining all the social gains won over years of trade union activity "".
.The Government replied to these arguments by stating that Act No.  was passed "" as a consequence of the undeniable need to give state undertakings adequate means of improving methods of work and of making full use of them, in order to attain the highest possible output from their human resources and to fulfil the operational requirements of each undertaking at high levels of production and efficiency "". The Government also refers to the machinery introduced by the Act, whereby the managements of state undertakings must inform the Secretary of State for Labour of their rationalisation requirements, whereupon collective bargaining is begun with the unions representing the workers concerned. This bargaining is designed to secure "" the determination of methods of work adapted to the requirements of efficiency and economy "". In order to overcome differences of opinion that may arise between the parties during collective bargaining, provision is made for arbitration.
.The Government adds that the negotiations which took place in compliance with Act No.  were completely free and that the complainant organisation negotiated of its own free will, no recourse being made to the special arbitration procedure provided under the Act. As regards the allegation concerning the unilateral imposition of conditions of work by the Government, this applies only to a specific branch when no trade union organisation exists to negotiate directly.
.The Committee observes, in the light of the text of Act No. , that this applies to state undertakings, state-owned undertakings, joint state-privately-owned undertakings and the electricity and telephone companies, which must formulate their requirements in the field of the rationalisation of labour (section ). Once it has been informed of these requirements, the Secretariat of State for Labour passes them on to the relevant trade union organisations for them to submit their observations (section ). Having heard the parties, the Secretariat decides the points that should be settled by collective bargaining, which must not take more than  days (section ). Points on which no agreement is reached during the bargaining procedures must be submitted to the arbitration of the Secretary of State for Labour, whose award is not subject to appeal (section ). If any of the trade union organisations does not accept the procedure or withdraws from it, the Secretariat must prepare a draft work scheme for the undertaking concerned, which is then submitted to the Executive for approval. In cases where the need for the introduction of a new set of working methods and the characteristics of the existing trade union situation involve a new approach, which hinders the bargaining procedure that has been instituted, the working conditions to be, applied will be established by the Executive (section ).
.The Committee considers that the use of collective bargaining for the purpose of settling problems of rationalisation in undertakings and improving their efficiency may yield valuable results for both the workers and the undertakings. There are examples of this in various countries where certain conditions of employment have been regulated through collective bargaining in the light of rationalisation needs.
.The Committee notes that in the present case this type of collective bargaining has to follow a special pattern which amounts to imposing bargaining on the trade organisations; this bargaining in fact has to bear on those aspects determined by the labour authority; the period of negotiation must not exceed a specified time; and failing agreement between the parties, the points at issue must be settled by arbitration by the said authority. In the Committee's opinion this statutory system does not conform to the principle of voluntary negotiation. This, however, is the guiding principle of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, whereby measures appropriate to national conditions must be taken, when necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreement.
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body (a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and the principles outlined in the preceding paragraph and to suggest that it review its legislation with a view to bringing it into line with the provision contained in Article  of Convention No. ; and (b) to bring these conclusions to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The complaint from the United Unions of Workers in the State Oil Industry is contained in a communication dated  October  and sent directly to the I.L.O. The communication was referred to the Government, which furnished its observations through the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic accredited to the international organisations at Geneva on  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the complainants state that the Act runs counter to various international standards relating to the work of seafarers, and that they criticise a series of changes made in the labour system in force for seafarers. They allege, in addition, that in promulgating Act No.  the Government has infringed the right to voluntary collective bargaining laid down in Convention No. . The Committee feels that it is not called upon to consider amendments made in national labour legislation unless they affect the exercise of trade union rights, but it is prepared, on the other hand, to examine the manner in which such amendments are imposed, taking into account in this instance the fact that the complainants state that the Government failed to consult the trade union organisations and overlooked the standards laid down in collective agreements. As regards the new provisions which concern the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee observes that section  of Act No.  lays down that agreements concluded between the parties concerned which alter the manning of ships shall not be valid.
.The action taken by the Argentine Government raises questions which have to be considered in the light",0,1967,Argentina
374,"of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina, according to which "" measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". In this respect the Committee has in previous cases pointed out the importance it attaches to the fact that the right to bargain freely with employers with respect to conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which might restrict the trade unions' right to seek, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent, or impede the lawful exercise of this right.
.In certain cases a the Committee has had to express its views on matters similar to those raised in this case, in examining legislation under which prior approval is required before collective agreements can take effect, the government being given the power to amend such agreements or refuse them its approval for reasons of economic policy. The Committee considers that such provisions are contrary to the principle of free bargaining provided for in Convention No. .
.The present case does not concern prior approval of a collective agreement, but the legislation has gone further by amending agreements which had already been in force for some time. In addition, the legislation also prohibits collective agreements concerning the manning of ships from being concluded in the future, as indicated in paragraph  above.
.The Committee has admitted certain exceptions to the general rule concerning interference by the authorities in collective bargaining. It has considered that in certain circumstances governments might feel that the situation in the country called for stabilising measures, and it has therefore accepted that during the application of such measures it would not be possible for wage rates to be fixed freely through the medium of collective bargaining.
.In this connection the Committee observes that Act No.  is only in force temporarily until the General Shipping Act is promulgated. Furthermore, it would appear that the latter of these Acts will cover some of the matters dealt with in Act No. , according to section  thereof. Hence in this case what is involved is not the mere suspension of particular clauses of a collective agreement, but a new method of regulation of these matters, by legislative action.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that, after the events described, the Government enacted Act No. , providing for the introduction of methods and systems of rationalisation of state undertakings in consultation with the trade unions. According to the Government, the United Unions of Workers in the State Oil Industry concluded the first collective agreement on rationalisation within the framework of this Act.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to Article  of Convention No. , and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which might restrict the unions' right to seek, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent, or which might impede the lawful exercise of this right;(b) to remind the Government of the importance it attaches to the principles contained in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), according to which the authorities should seek the views, advice and assistance of the employers' and workers' organisations in an appropriate manner in respect of the preparation and implementation of laws and regulations affecting their interests;(c) to take due note of the fact that, after the events alleged, the Government promulgated Act No. , which has enabled the complainants to negotiate a rationalisation agreement with the appropriate state undertaking.",4,1967,Argentina
375,".The Committee considered Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , February, May and November  and March , when it submitted to the Governing Body the reports contained, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report, all of which were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its th Report the Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body in respect of the various allegations examined, in the following terms:
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the detention of the trade union official, Eustaquio Tolosa, to express its satisfaction at the decision to reduce his sentence, a decision in which the Committee's conclusions were taken into account, and the fact that Mr. Tolosa has now been released;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed and the repeated requests made to it, the Government has not yet brought to an end those measures to take over unions which were still in force, and to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to interference by the authorities in the affairs of the CGT, measures directed against union leaders and members and compulsory arbitration and collective bargaining:(i) to regret the failure on a number of occasions to supply the information requested on which the Committee was relying in order to formulate its conclusions on the said allegations with a full knowledge of the facts;(ii) to draw the Government's attention once more to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which states that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, while the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise; and to the principle laid down in Article  of the Convention that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations; and that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, the Government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, this restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.These conclusions were transmitted to the Government, which supplied information in three communications dated  May,  September and  October .
.In the meantime, the International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions had sent a communication dated  February  containing allegations of infringement of trade union rights in Argentina in connection with collective bargaining. The Government has not yet forwarded its observations on this complaint, which has been recorded as Case No. . Since the allegations relate to one of the aspects examined in Case No. , the Committee has decided to amalgamate the two cases and deal with them together.
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).Allegations relating to Measures to Take Over Various Trade Union Organisations and to Suspend Their Trade Union Status
.At its session in March  the Committee referred to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status which it had examined at earlier sessions. The Committee recalled on this occasion the Act of the Argentine Revolution concerning the taking over of trade unions and the various statements by the Government to the effect that it was hastening the process of a return to normal in the trade union movement, and drew attention to the time which had elapsed since the taking over of the unions still deprived of their status and to the importance of such a return to normal if these organisations were to exercise their rights under Convention No.  to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.The Committee had before it a communication dated  January  from the Government in which it indicated that the basis for the measures to take over trade unions was the need to promote the process of reorganisation of the unions concerned and their return to a normal situation in accordance with the aims pursued by the Government of the Argentine Revolution. The letter went on to say that all the organisations taken over had been engaging in activities outside their powers. As their voting lists were restored to normal, the Government intended to call elections and allow the unions to revert to their normal operation. The Government again stated, as it had done to the Committee on previous occasions, that these measures were not directed against the exercise of trade union rights. On the contrary, the Government hoped to count on the participation of the workers in the task of reconstructing the country. But if this participation was to be effective and fruitful, the unions must abide by the law and carry out specifically occupational activities, and their leaders must be genuinely representative. Accordingly, it was of cardinal importance that such organisations should bring their Constitutions into line with the legislation in force. The Government concluded by stating that it would keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over.
.At its meeting in May  the Committee had already pointed out that in some cases the Government had lifted the suspension of the status of certain unions, such as the Textile Workers' Union and the Metal Workers' Union, but it had not done so in the case of other unions which had been deprived of their status at the same time and for the same reason.
.The Government has appended to its communications of  September and  October  copies of Resolutions Nos.  and  of  August , restoring the trade union status of the Telephone and Telecommunications Workers' Union of the Republic of Argentina (FOETRA) and annulling the suspension of the trade union status of the Buenos Aires branch of that Federation, and a copy of Resolution No.  restoring the trade union status of the Tucumn Sugar Industry Workers' Union (FOTIA).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the measures taken in respect of the trade union organisations mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and to urge the Government once again to lift the suspension of the trade union status and end the takeover of the unions still affected, and to keep the Committee informed in this respect.Allegations relating to Collective Bargaining and Compulsory Arbitration
.At its session in November  the Committee examined a number of allegations made by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions to the effect that Act No.  of  respecting compulsory arbitration eliminated the right to strike and the provisions of Act No.  that respected collective agreements and violated the relevant international standards. The General Confederation of Labour of the Argentine Republic had mentioned the same Act in its communication. The FOETRA, for its part, had stated that by virtue of Act No.  referring to private concerns, and Act No.  referring to the public sector, "" the joint agreements on collective bargaining have been abolished "".
.With regard to Act No.  respecting compulsory arbitration, the Government, which had supplied the text, had explained that the Act owed its existence to the need to seek appropriate formulae to settle labour disputes that might affect vital national interests and delay the process of recovery to which the Argentine Revolution was committed. As for Act No. , the Government had denied that it constituted a violation of freedom of association and stated that its purpose was to harmonise and co-ordinate the economic recovery of the country and at the same time to ensure the workers a genuine wage by means of graded increases fitting in with the",2,1966,Argentina
376,"dates of expiry of the various collective agreements.
.The Committee observed that the legal provisions in question appeared to raise questions that should be examined in the light of certain generally recognised principles respecting freedom of association and, in any case, in the light of that contained in Article  of Convention No. -ratified by Argentina-to the effect that "" measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". The Committee, observed, however, that the provisions of Act No.  were intended to remain in force only until  December .
.In view of the fact that the observations of the Government had been expressed in general terms and concerned only part of the allegations relating to collective bargaining, the Committee postponed consideration of these allegations and requested the Government to be good enough to report on specific cases in which Act No.  was applied, and also to send the text of Acts Nos.  and .
.With its communication of  February , the International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions, acting on behalf of its affiliated organisation, the Glass and Allied Industries Trade Union of Argentina (Sindicato Obrero de la Industria del Vidrio y Afines de la Argentina) forwarded the text of Act No.  of , alleging that the Government was prohibiting collective bargaining, in violation of Act No.  respecting collective agreements and ILO Convention No. . Under the terms of Act No.  a general wage increase was granted, the collective agreements in force were extended until  December  and Acts Nos.  and  were ordered to remain in force until the same date.
.The Government supplied the information requested of it on  May . According to its communication, Act No.  provided for increases in the basic remuneration established by the collective agreements due to expire in  and kept the agreements in force until  December . This Act, according to the Government, formed an instrument of economic policy to supplement the other measures adopted in the field of budgets, taxation, exchange, customs and finance with a view to the urgent stopping of the inflationary spiral. Act No.  was an emergency measure adopted in view of the prevailing economic situation. The Government went on to state that the Act in question had been replaced by Act No.  of  December , in order to prolong the emergency rules made necessary by the economic conditions the country was going through. The new Act maintained the temporary suspension of the system of concluding collective agreements-which would be re-established as soon as the Act expired on  December -and provided for a general increase in wages.
.With regard to Act No.  the Government states that under it a Technical Advisory Commission on Wage Policy had been set up to be responsible for the study, analysis and assessment of measures to establish a co-ordinated and harmonious wage policy with respect to the central administration, state undertakings, decentralised bodies and private public service undertakings covering the whole national territory or whose activities exceeded the boundaries of a province. Every plan for modifying the pay of the staff of the above-mentioned establishments must be submitted in advance to this Commission, which would issue the instructions to be followed with respect thereto.
.As for the application in practice of Act No.  respecting compulsory arbitration, the Government stated that arbitration awards had been issued in four cases, concerning commercial employees, textile workers, tram workers and workers in the meat industry.
.The Government concluded by declaring that all these Acts are emergency measures whose sole effect had been a temporary suspension of collective bargaining in regard to the fixing of wages. It was the Government's intention to re-establish the system of Act No.  respecting collective agreements as soon as economic conditions permitted. In the Government's view the legislation referred to above did not infringe either Convention No.  or any principle connected with freedom of association.
.Since this communication from the Government further legislative provisions in this connection have been enacted and have been brought to the Committee's knowledge. Mention may be made first of all of Decree No.  of  August  and Act No.  of  September . These texts authorise the re-negotiation of the collective agreements kept in force under Acts Nos.  and . The agreements re-negotiated in accordance with these provisions shall remain in force from  January  to  December . The negotiations must be completed within  days. If agreement cannot be reached, the authority may refer the matter to compulsory arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Act No. , which is now to remain in force until  December . While this Act provides that the parties may be compelled to go to arbitration where the dispute "" is of such a character as to affect the economic activity, productivity, development and progress of the nation and/or the security and well-being of the community "", these terms are so broad that they give the impression that the authority can submit to arbitration practically all cases in which it has not been possible to reach agreement.
.The Committee has also taken note of the enactment of other provisions relevant to the same subject. Act No. , already mentioned, provides for a certain increase in the prevailing minimum living wage, and Decree No.  of  September  does the same with respect to various family allowances. Act No.  of  September  prohibits the reflection in prices of higher costs resulting from the negotiation of new collective agreements, except in certain cases. Lastly, Decree No.  of the same date provides for the setting up of a National Prices and Wages Advisory Board, tripartite in composition, and with advisory and informatory functions, which will be required to publish an annual report analysing and forecasting trends in prices and wages.
.The Government has more recently, on  October , introduced further measures affecting collective bargaining. Acts Nos.  and , promulgated on that date, grant a general increase in the pay of all workers in private employment from  November  and provide for a further increase from I March , to remain in effect until  December . The Government may readjust pay rates from  January  if there is evidence of a decline in the value of real earnings, to be determined on the basis of the annual report to be submitted by the National Prices and Wages Advisory Board. Collective bargaining must exclude all matters pertaining to the fixing of wages. The wage increases granted must not be reflected in prices, with certain exceptions.
.The Committee observes that, according to the Government's declarations, the restrictive measures adopted in respect of collective bargaining are emergency measures and the resultant suspension of the provisions of Act No.  respecting collective agreements is only temporary. From the terms of the more recent legislation it is evident that these too are temporary measures, although it is worthy of comment that the restrictions imposed on collective bargaining as far as wages are concerned are to remain in force for a prolonged period lasting until the end of .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while taking note of the legislation enacted by the Government with respect to collective bargaining, as well as of the temporary and emergency nature this legislation is said to have, to reaffirm that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations. Furthermore, in view of the implications for the standard of living of the workers of the fixing of wages by the Government, by-passing the collective bargaining process, and of the Government's wage policy in general, the Committee also recommends the Governing Body to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the promotion of effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and workers' organisations in this respect, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), for the purpose of considering jointly matters of mutual concern with a view to arriving, to the fullest possible extent, at agreed solutions.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to measures to take over various trade union organisations and to suspend their trade union status:(i) to take note of the measures taken to restore the trade union status of the Telephone and Telecommunications Workers' Union of the Republic of Argentina (FOETRA) and the Tucumn Sugar Industry Workers' Union (FOTIA) and annulling the suspension of the trade union status of the Buenos Aires branch of that Federation;(ii)",0,1966,Argentina
377,"to urge the Government once again to lift the suspension of the trade union status and end the takeover of the unions still affected, and to keep the Committee informed in this respect;(b) as regards the allegations relating to collective bargaining and compulsory arbitration:(i) while taking note of the legislation enacted by the Government with respect to collective bargaining, as well as the temporary and emergency nature this legislation is said to have, to reaffirm that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations;(ii) in view of the implications for the standard of living of the workers of the fixing of wages by the Government, by-passing the collective bargaining process, and of the Government's wage policy in general, to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the promotion of effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and workers' and employers' organisations in this respect, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), for the purpose of considering jointly matters of mutual concern with a view to arriving, to the fullest possible extent, at agreed solutions.
.The Committee considered this case at its sessions in May and November  and February, May and November , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report, all of which were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its th Report the Committee made a number of recommendations to the Governing Body, some of which were to the effect that the Argentine Government should be requested to supply the information and observations for which it had been asked in order to permit further examination of the allegations. These recommendations were forwarded to the Government, which replied in three communications dated ,  and  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that this reply by the Government appears to refer only to the allegations mentioned in paragraph  above. The Government justifies its take-over of the unions concerned on the ground that they had departed from their occupational aims, and declares that the measures in question were designed to allow a normal situation to be restored, for which purpose it intended to call new elections of union officers.
.The Committee notes that, despite the time which has elapsed and the repeated requests made to the Government, the latter has not yet brought to an end those measures to take over unions which were still in force. The Committee considers that in the interval which has elapsed-in the case of the United Argentine Dockers' Union, more than two years-a return to a normal situation and the election of new officers could have been ensured.
.As regards the other allegations referred to in paragraphs , ,  and  above, the Government has not supplied the information for which it has repeatedly been asked. The Government has thus failed to provide a good deal of the evidence on which the Committee was relying in order to be able to formulate its conclusions with a full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed and the repeated requests made to it, the Government has not yet brought to an end those measures to take over unions which were still in force, and to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over;(b) as regards the allegations relating to interference by the authorities in the affairs of the CGT, the measures directed against union leaders and members, and compulsory arbitration and collective bargaining:(i) to regret the failure on a number of occasions to supply the information requested on which the Committee was relying in order to formulate its conclusions on the said allegations with a full knowledge of the facts;(ii) to draw the Government's attention once more to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which states that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, while the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise; and to the principle laid down in Article  of the Convention that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations; and that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, the Government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, this restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the detention of the trade union official, Eustaquio Tolosa, to express its satisfaction at the decision to reduce his sentence, a decision in which the Committee's conclusions were taken into account, and at the fact that Mr. Tolosa has now been released;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the taking over of various trade union organisations and the suspension of their trade union status, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed and the repeated requests made to it, the Government has not yet brought to an end those measures to take over unions which were still in force, and to take note of the Government's statement that it intends to keep the Committee informed, within the briefest possible period, on the return to a normal situation by the unions taken over;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to interference by the authorities in the affairs of the CGT, measures directed against union leaders and members and compulsory arbitration and collective bargaining:(i) to regret the failure on a number of occasions to supply the information requested on which the Committee was relying in order to formulate its conclusions on the said allegations with a full knowledge of the facts;(ii) to draw the Government's attention once more to the importance of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which states that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, while the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise; and to the principle laid down in Article  of the Convention that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees who are not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations; and that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, the Government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, this restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.The Committee previously considered this case at its sessions in May and November  and February and May , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, and paragraphs  to  of its th Report, all of which were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee made certain recommendations, some of which were to request the Government of Argentina to supply further information. These recommendations were communicated to the Government in",4,1966,Argentina
378,"a letter dated  June : the Government replied in a letter forwarded by the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic to the international organisations in Geneva on  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the detention of Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa:(i) to take note of the judgment at second instance against Mr. Tolosa, in proceedings in which the offence provided for in Act No.  of  was under consideration for the first time in Argentina;(ii) to reaffirm the principles contained in the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), which states that measures appropriate to national conditions should be taken to promote effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and employers' and workers' organisations, as well as the standard expressed in Article  of Convention No. , which provides that any organisation, federation or Confederation shall have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers or employers;(iii) to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any new developments with regard to Mr. Tolosa, and in particular of any pardon which might be decided upon;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the measures to take over various trade union organisations and to suspend their trade union status, and with regard to the other allegations outstanding, to regret that the Government has not supplied the information and observations requested, and to urge the Government to be good enough to send this information as soon as possible, in order to permit the further examination of these allegations;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report on the case once it has received the information referred to in the preceding subparagraph.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its sessions in May and November  and February , when it submitted to the Governing Body interim reports thereon, which are contained respectively in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report and paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. These three reports were approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its rd Report the Committee made a number of recommendations of the Governing Body on various aspects of the case, some of which involved requesting certain additional information from the Government. Once the Governing Body had given its approval, these recommendations were brought to the notice of the Government in a letter dated  March .
.After the report mentioned in the previous paragraph had been approved, additional information was received from the International Transport Workers' Federation (I.T.F.) on  March , from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions on  April , and from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Transport Workers on  April . The communications were transmitted to the Government.
.The Government furnished its observations and additional information through the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic accredited to the international organisations at Geneva on  March and  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the detention of Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa:(i) to take note of the verdict against him;(ii) to call the Government's attention to the principles set forth in paragraph ;(iii) to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any new developments in the case of Mr. Tolosa, especially as regards any appeal against the sentence, and, in case of an appeal, to forward a copy of the decision by the court concerned;(b) with regard to the measures to take over various trade union organisations and to suspend their trade union status, in view of the circumstances mentioned above in paragraph :(i) to take note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that it has restored the trade union status of the Textile Workers' Union and the Metal Workers' Union;(ii) to urge the Government once more to repeal as soon as possible the measures still in force to suspend and take over certain trade unions and to request the Government to keep it informed about the measures it has taken or proposes to take to this end;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report on the case when it has received the information requested from the Government in clauses (a) and (b) of this paragraph and in paragraph  above.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meetings in May and November , when it submitted to the Governing Body interim reports thereon which may be found, respectively, in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report and in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. Both reports have been approved by the Governing Body.
.In paragraph  of its st Report the Committee made recommendations to the Governing Body in respect of a number of aspects of this case, some of which were to the effect that the Government be requested to supply additional information on specific points. As soon as these recommendations had been approved by the Governing Body they were brought to the attention of the Government by a letter dated  November .
.By a communication dated  December  from the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic in Geneva the Government has forwarded certain observations and information respecting some of the allegations which remain outstanding. This report will deal exclusively with the matters referred to by the Government in this communication.
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the detention of the trade union official, Eustaquio Tolosa, bearing in mind the importance attached to the strict observance of the basic principles of freedom of association and particularly the importance of the principle of prompt and fair trial, to request the Government to be good enough to inform it as soon as possible as to the likelihood of a judgment on the case being pronounced shortly concerning Mr. Tolosa or the possibility of his being released pending such judgment;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the dock dispute of , to decide, without prejudice to the other conclusions set forth in paragraph  (c) of the Committee's st Report, that the allegation that most of the port workers of Buenos Aires have been deprived of their employment for having acted in defence of their trade union interests does not call for further examination;(c) with regard to the allegations relating to measures to suspend the trade union status of various workers' organisations:(i) to draw the Government's attention once again to the views set forth in paragraphs  and  above;(ii) to express once again the hope that those of the measures taken in February and March  to suspend trade union status which are still in force will be rescinded in the near future, and request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed as to the action it has taken or proposes to take to this end;(d) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further when it has received the additional information requested from the Government in paragraph  of its st Report and in subparagraphs (a) and (c) of this paragraph.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meeting in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.Since the approval of the report fresh allegations or further elements of information have been received in a new communication dated  May  from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, in two communications dated  June and  July  from the General Confederation of Labour of the Argentine Republic (C.G.T.), and in a communication dated  July  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Transport Workers. Copies of all these communications have been sent to the Government.
.The Government has sent further observations and information on  May,  August,  September,  October and  October  through the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic to the International Organisations in Geneva.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the",-1,1966,Argentina
379,"Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) for the reasons expressed in paragraphs ,  and  above respectively, to decide that the allegations concerning the interference of the Government in the  Congress of the C.G.T, the Civil Defence Act and various points mentioned in general terms in the C.G.T complaint do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the arrest of the trade union leader, Eustaquio Tolosa:(i) to take note of the Government's statement that proceedings are continuing before a court of ordinary jurisdiction in connection with the prosecution brought against Mr. Tolosa for having contravened section  of Act No. ;(ii) to take note that, in the meantime, Mr. Tolosa continues to be under preventive detention by virtue of the writ issued by the judge in the case and confirmed by the appeals court;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle of prompt and fair trial, mentioned in paragraph  above, and to request the Government to be good enough to keep the Governing Body informed of Mr. Tolosa's situation, and to be good enough to send the text of the judgment, as well as the grounds adduced therein, once it has been given.(c) with regard to the  dock dispute:(i) to take note of the declaration by the Government that it does not intend to maintain its control of the United Argentine Dockers' Union indefinitely and that it will rather endeavour to ensure that the organisation in question is shortly able to operate normally;(ii) to express the hope that the necessary measures will be adopted as soon as possible and to ask the Government to keep it informed of developments in this connection;(iii) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance that it has always attached, where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services, to the subjection of such restrictions to impartial and rapid conciliation and arbitration procedures, in all stage of which the parties concerned can take part;(iv) to take note of the statement by the Government that the emergency measures have been lifted and that work in the port of Buenos Aires has been entirely restored to normal;(v) to request the Government nevertheless to be good enough to reply to the allegation that most of the port workers of Buenos Aires have been deprived of employment for having acted in defence of their trade union interests;(d) with regard to the measures to take over various trade union organisations or to suspend their trade union status:(i) to take note that the Government has rescinded section  of Resolution No. /, which suspended the authorisation to retain dues and contributions on behalf of and that the Railway Workers' five trade union organisations, Union has recovered its legal status;(ii) with regard to the measures to suspend trade union status, to point out again to the Government, for the reasons expressed in paragraphs  to  above, the importance of the provision in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Argentina, to the effect that workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(iii) to request the Government to be good enough to explain whether a legal appeal against a resolution suspending trade union status has suspensory effect;(iv) with regard to the decrees to take over various trade union organisations and the measures to freeze their bank accounts, to draw the attention of the Government once more to the importance of the provisions of Article  of Convention No.  relating to the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and to point out to it also the importance, where trade unions violate legal or statutory provisions, of ensuring that control is exercised by the judicial authorities with a view to guaranteeing an impartial and objective procedure;(v) to express the hope that the measures referred to in clauses (ii) and (iv) of this subparagraph that are still in force will be rescinded in the near future and to ask the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any developments in this connection;(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will present a new report on the aspects of the case that are still pending when it has received the additional information mentioned in points (b) (iii), (c) (ii) and (v), (d) (iii) and (v) of this paragraph and the additional information requested by the Committee in paragraphs ,  and  of the present report.
.The complaints are contained in a number of communications to the I.L.O from the organisations and on the dates mentioned below: International Federation of Christian Trade Unions ( December ), Argentine Trade Union Movement (A.S.A.) ( February ), Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions ( March ), World Federation of Trade Unions ( March ), International Transport Workers' Federation ( April ), and International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May ), with reference to and in support of two communications sent to the I.L.O on  March and  April  by the International Metalworkers' Federation, which is associated with the I.C.F.T.U. Additional information and further allegations have been submitted by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (in a communication dated  April ), the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (three communications dated  April,  April and  May ) and the International Metalworkers' Federation ( May ). All these communications were transmitted to the Argentine Government as they were received.
.The allegations relate mainly to the arrest of a trade union leader, to legislative provisions changing the standards governing work in the docks and the resulting labour dispute and to various measures of interference, suspension of trade union status and freezing of bank accounts stated to have been adopted by the Government in the case of several trade union organisations mentioned in the complaints, etc.
.The Government submitted its observations on certain aspects of the case by a communication dated  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  December  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) alleges that on  December  armed police burst into a trade union meeting and that as a result more than  persons were placed under arrest and many were wounded. The Argentine Trade Union Movement, in its communication of  February , alleges that the Government unilaterally enforced new labour standards for dockers by a decree, No. , which violated previous agreements, without having consulted the trade unions concerned (United Argentine Dockers' Union (S.U.P.A.), Dock Coalworkers' Union, Shipping Agents and Inspectors' Union, Stevedore Foremen's Association) and that the leaders of the S.U.P.A were removed from office by a decree of  October  and replaced by a civil servant. The A.S.A. adds that the police broke up a general meeting of the S.U.P.A on  December  and arrested its General Secretary, Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa.
.The Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, in its communication of  April , alleges that Decree No.  increased permitted hours of work in unhealthy occupations, reduced the number of workers on each shift, altered the method of calculating wages for work on public holidays, Saturday afternoons, etc. On  October , according to the complainants, the Economic Affairs and Labour Secretary informed the representatives of the union that conditions of work in ports were to be modified by legislation and that the new port authority would issue new labour regulations; the union, having requested that the enforcement of the new measures be postponed and that it be allowed to take part in framing the new regulations, was informed on the following day that on  October the new regulations would come into force. The L.A.C.F.T.U goes on to state that the trade union lodged an appeal with the President of the Republic and on  October asked for  days to discuss the new labour regulations and other points, only to be told that "" the law has already been enacted and laws do not call for discussion "". On  October S.U.P.A declared a general strike and on the same day the Government declared it to be "" outside the scope of lawful trade union activities "" and appointed a naval officer as the responsible head of the union, whose premises were occupied by the armed forces.
.The International Transport Workers' Federation (I.T.F.), in its complaint of  April , made detailed allegations",2,1966,Argentina
380,"concerning developments in this dispute. It begins by stating that when the dockers' unions learned of the Government's intention of issuing new labour laws and regulations they submitted a memorandum on dockers' problems in which they emphasised the need to create a national port policy and expressed their willingness to co-operate for that purpose. As the Government refused to consider this offer of conciliation and co-operation, the dockers' unions declared a strike. Mr. Tolosa left the country for Montevideo to secure his personal safety and direct the strike from there.
.According to the I.T.F, the Government continued to maintain an intransigent attitude even though the dockers' unions had offered a solution including, among other points, the lifting of government control of the union, postponement of the enforcement of the new laws for  days, the creation of a tripartite committee of employers', workers' and government representatives to study the application of the new laws and the submission of any unresolved matters to arbitration.
.The I.T.F states that on  October it sent its member unions a circular requesting "" the fullest possible manifestation of international solidarity in an effort to assist the Argentine dockers "". At the same time a cable was sent to President Ongania "" notifying him of the possibility of international action and offering him the assistance of the I.T.F in mediation and negotiation "". In order to ensure that the Government had a true picture of the interest of the I.T.F in the dispute, Mr. Medrano, I.T.F. Director in Latin America, met various Argentine authorities including the Labour Secretary, who told him that if the dockers accepted the new regulations on working conditions temporarily a tripartite committee would be set up to consider the matter. After consulting with the unions, Mr. Medrano drafted the terms of a solution and submitted it to the Labour Secretary, who informed him that the Transport Secretary would have to be consulted before the Government could give a reply. Finally, after further meetings were held, the Labour Secretary, the I.T.F states, accepted a text, a copy of which is attached to its communication.
.The checkers' and foremen's unions agreed unanimously to accept the solution and return to work on  December. A delegates' conference of S.U.P.A was convened for Sunday,  December, which it was confidently expected would end the strike. When the delegates had assembled, the police arrested Mr. Tolosa on the grounds that he had left the country without permission; he was subsequently released on bail but re-arrested on a charge of acts harmful to the Argentine economy and finally released on  December.
.Still according to the I.T.F, the unions decided, once Mr. Tolosa was free, to return to work on  December on the basis of the agreement reached with the Secretaries of Labour and Transport, but when the men reported for work they were prevented from entering the dock area by the police and the military. The strike thus became a lockout, which the complainant organisation affirms is proof of the Government's intention to impose unilaterally its own conditions of work on the trade unions. It also affirms that the Government tried to force the acceptance of strike breakers in the docks and allow only sufficient regular dockers to be registered to make up the number required for the working of the port. The figures proposed by the captain in charge of the port were as follows:Strike breakers	Regular dockers	TotalForemen			Checkers			Dockers	,		,
.These figures, the complainants say, show strike breakers were greatly in the majority, leaving most of the port workers of Buenos Aires without employment because they had acted in defence of their legitimate trade union rights.
.In the meantime, a further warrant having been issued for Mr. Tolosa, he decided to give himself up on  January  and has been in prison ever since.
.Lastly, the complainants state that despite several further approaches made by the Regional Director to the authorities and those made by a joint I.C.F.T.U.-I.T.F mission, the Government maintained its attitude. The complainants state that the facts set forth constitute infringements of I.L.O. Conventions Nos.  and , since the Government has: taken steps to modify conditions of work in ports without prior consultation with the unions concerned; refused to consider any proposals submitted by the dockers' unions and in particular the memorandum on dockers' problems; appointed an official to take charge of the dockers' union (S.U.P.A.); recruited strike breakers; arrested the General Secretary of S.U.P.A, Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa, on  December  just as he was about to chair a meeting of his union, and again on  January ; locked out dockworkers, thereby victimising them for having taken part in a campaign ordered by their union; failed to honour the agreement reached by the representative of the complainant organisation and the Labour and Transport Secretaries.
.In its reply dated  May  to the allegations put forward by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions and the Argentine Trade Union Movement, the Government states that in connection with the dockers' strike, Mr. Tolosa, who was on trial for his activities in the so-called Plan of Action of the C.G.T of , left the country without the necessary court authorisation to settle in Montevideo, where he began promoting the notion of an international boycott of Argentine ships and planes.
.The Government goes on to say that after an agreement had been reached which was to be examined by a union meeting on  December , Mr. Tolosa returned to Argentina. When this came to the knowledge of the judge who was conducting the proceedings, he ordered Tolosa to be arrested by virtue of section  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Federal Capital which stipulates that, in order to be released on bail, a person standing trial shall undertake to obey any summons emanating from the judge and to have a fixed place of residence from which he may not absent himself without the knowledge and authorisation of the judge; a breach of this provision is sufficient to cause the accused to be imprisoned again.
.The Government supplies the text of a report by the federal police showing that the arrest was made in execution of an order from a national federal judge of the Criminal and Correctional Court of First instance in connection with Case No. / against various persons on charges of sedition and other offences. The report states that the arrest was made before the meeting convened by the leaders of the S.U.P.A began and that Mr. Tolosa complied with the order given by the police officer; although a few hot-heads tried to oppose his arrest, no one else was arrested and nobody was wounded or hurt.
.From various press cuttings supplied by the Government it would appear that legal proceedings were subsequently taken against Mr. Tolosa before another court for a breach of section  of Act No. , which makes an Argentine citizen liable to imprisonment if he promotes economic or political measures against the interests of the State by any means whatsoever.
.With regard to the dockers' dispute, the Government supplies the following information. With a view to achieving full operation of the country's ports, rational regulation of dock work and the elimination of a wastage of human and material resources that was detrimental to the community, the President of Argentina exercised the powers conferred on him by the Statute of the Argentine Revolution to approve Acts Nos.  and  and Decree No. . The Government supplies the text of all these provisions.
.The Government states that in this way dock work is brought within the scope of the general legislation regarding hours of work, days of rest and holidays which is applicable to all workers in the country. These measures modified the previous system which had also been set up unilaterally by the State (Legislative Decree No. / and Decree No. /) and distorted the principle of equality. In spite of these exceptional measures to regulate it, work in ports was constantly being perturbed by disputes arising out of futile motives and which led to an exorbitant rise in the cost of labour, so much so that the ports of Argentina became the most expensive in the world, particularly Buenos Aires which earned the name of "" dirty port "", with a resultant increase in freight rates. Act No.  and regulations thereunder lay down essential standards to enable port work to be brought back into the scope of the general labour law as already established.
.The Government takes the view that there has been no breach of any international agreement, any canon, standard or principle of social justice, or any prior collective agreement with the trade union organisations.
.It goes on to state that the Acts and decree in question were no sooner promulgated than the S.U.P.A declared a strike for the express purpose of paralysing port activities and solicited, through its representatives, the support of foreign trade unions in boycotting Argentine ships and planes and all the goods carried by them. According to the Government,",0,1966,Argentina
381,"this behaviour was a veritable rebellion against the law itself, since it aimed at damaging the vital interests of the nation in open opposition and rebellion against the authority which the State exercises solely with a view to protecting those interests.
.Lastly, the Government states that Act No.  recognises, among the rights appertaining to trade union organisations, that of non-intervention in their management and administration on the part of the authority responsible for enforcing the law. However, the rights so recognised refer only to lawful activities. The Government takes the view that the principles stated must also apply to international agreements, the ratification of which should not oblige a State to emasculate its own action in re-establishing law and order. The taking over of the trade union decreed by the Government was duly analysed by the national labour courts, in both the first and second instance, as a result of the appeal lodged by the persons concerned; the National Chamber of Labour unanimously voted "" that the provisions of Decree No. / be promulgated in full "". The Government quotes part of the ruling of the Chamber of Labour, which states that the new system of regulation of dock work is a vital part of the economic policy of the Government and has direct repercussions at both national and international level on the development of activities of prime importance to the State such as import and export trade. In the opinion of the Chamber of Labour, the measures decreed by the Government were necessary to safeguard the activities threatened by the strike and the international boycott promoted by the trade union; they were taken in order to overcome the serious emergency in which the country had been placed by the trade unions.
.The Government also attached to its reply various comments published by Argentine newspapers, some of which stress the national economic difficulties caused by the poor operation of the ports and the advantage to the country of accelerating the loading and unloading of ships, etc.
.With regard to the allegations concerning police interference in the trade union meeting held on  December  and the arrest of other persons besides Mr. Eustaquio Tolosa, the Committee notes from the Government's observations that the action of the police was restricted to arresting Mr. Tolosa. Since the complainants have not supplied particulars regarding the other persons they claim were arrested, the Committee therefore considers that there would be no purpose in proceeding further with the examination of these particular allegations.
.As regards the arrest of Mr. Tolosa, it appears from the information supplied by the Government that it was made in compliance with court orders issued in connection with two criminal trials, the first initiated in  and the second based on criminal offences with which Mr. Tolosa was charged in connection with the labour dispute to which the complaints refer.
.In the past the Committee has always followed the practice of not proceeding to examine matters which were the subject of pending national judicial proceedings offering all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure, where such proceedings might make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations were well-founded. In many cases the Committee has requested governments to communicate the text of the judgments given and their grounds.
.Consequently the Committee feels it is necessary, before proceeding with its examination of this particular aspect of the matter, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the text of the judgments given in the case of Mr. Tolosa and the reasons adduced therefor.
.Moreover, the Committee has always stressed the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence, in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights. It has also pointed out that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised. In cases where it is observed that restrictions are placed on strikes in essential services, the Committee has always emphasised the importance it attaches to the establishment of adequate guarantees for workers thus deprived of the possibility of protecting their occupational rights s and observed that such restrictions should be made subject to impartial and rapid conciliation and arbitration procedure in all stages of which the interested parties can take part.
.In the present case the complainants state that the strike called by the workers and which led the Government to issue a decree taking over the United Argentine Dockers' Union (S.U.P.A.) was motivated by the Government's having legislated to modify the working conditions of dockers. The Government, for its part, states that the aforesaid working conditions had from the beginning been established by law and not by collective agreement and that the changes decreed, which did not exceed the scope authorised by the general labour laws, were indispensable for the vital interests of the country. The taking over of S.U.P.A was designed to protect those same vital interests, which were threatened by the strike and the international boycott promoted by the trade union. Argentine courts of the first and second instance had authenticated the validity and legitimacy of the take-over decree.
.The Committee notes the explanations supplied by the Government in connection with the dockers' dispute. It would appear, however, that one of the trade unions concerned, the United Argentine Dockers' Union, is still under government control at present and it is not clear whether or not there is any intention of reviewing the matters under dispute through conciliation or arbitration procedure in all stages of which the interested parties can take part, in accordance with the principles set forth in paragraph  above. The Committee would be glad to receive additional information from the Government in this connection.
.Moreover, no observations have as yet been received from the Government concerning other aspects of the case which were raised in the complaint of the International Transport Workers' Federation, namely the allegations to the effect that the Government had refused to examine the proposals originally put forward by the workers; that an agreement reached with the Labour Secretary after the strike had begun had been broken; and that anti-trade union repressive measures, including the recruitment of strike breakers, had been taken against the workers participating in the strike (see paragraph  above).
.Nor have any observations been received from the Government concerning the other complaints and additional information supplied by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the International Metalworkers' Federation, which are mentioned in paragraph  above and refer inter alia to government interference with a number of workers' organisations, besides the taking over of the S.U.P.A as already stated.
.Bearing in mind the principles set forth in paragraph  above and the provision contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), according to which workers' organisations are entitled to elect their representatives in full freedom, organise their administration and activities, and formulate their programmes, and the public authorities must refrain from any interference which would restrict that right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, the Committee feels it is necessary, before proceeding with its examination of the case and formulating further conclusions, to have the observations of the Government on the points raised in paragraphs ,  and  above.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:",-1,1966,Argentina
382,".This case was examined previously by the Committee at its sessions in May , November  and May , when it submitted interim reports which appear in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report,  to  of its th Report and  to  of its th Report, approved respectively by the Governing Body at its nd, rd and th Sessions (May-June , November  and May ).
.In those reports the Committee submitted its final conclusions with respect to some of the allegations made by the complainants, part of which refer to proceedings against trade union officers in connection with the approval and execution of a "" Battle Plan "" on the part of the General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.) in .
.However, in paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee asked the Government to inform it of the exact nature of the offences with which two trade unionists, Mr. Felipe Ernesto Luduea and Mr. Carlos Kristoff, were charged, these persons having been mentioned in a communication from the Government dated  March . The Committee's request was conveyed to the Government by a letter dated  June , and the latter's observations were notified to the I.L.O by a communication dated  September  from the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic in Geneva.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that Mr. Felipe Ernesto Luduea was arrested on the public thoroughfare on  March , being found to have in his possession four sticks of gelignite and two lead detonators. The arrest took place in the presence of three witnesses, who signed the police report of confiscation and later testified in court. The judge of the criminal court of the first instance issued an indictment under sections  and bis of the Penal Code, but the case was suspended on  April  and Mr. Luduea was released the same day. As regards Mr. Kristoff the Government states that as a result of a dispute in the plumbers' union various occurrences took place which made it necessary for the police to intervene. Several persons, whose names are supplied by the Government, were brought before courts of summary jurisdiction or criminal courts on charges such as violation of freedom to work, causing bodily injury, damaging the mains of a building in construction and the discovery of eight sticks of gelignite, a detonator and a fuse on trade union premises. In one of these trials, which began on  September , Mr. Kristoff and others were charged with violation of freedom to work and causing bodily injury. In the case against Mr. Kristoff who, according to the Government, already has a police record and has previously been tried for anarchical and terrorist activities, a suspension was ordered on  November  and confirmed by the Appeals Court.
.The Government states that the proceedings against Mr. Luduea and Mr. Kristoff have no relation whatsoever to the detention of trade union leaders in connection with C.G.T's "" Battle Plan "".
.This case was examined previously by the Committee at its meetings in May  and November , when it submitted interim reports which appear in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved respectively by the Governing Body at its nd and rd Sessions (May  and November ).
.In those reports the Committee submitted its final conclusions with respect to some of the allegations made by the complainants, and the only aspect of the case which remains outstanding is that relating to proceedings against trade union officers. The present report therefore deals only with this point.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.A summary of the allegations of the General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.) with regard to proceedings against trade union officers will be found in paragraphs  and  of the Committee's rd Report. It is alleged in substance that on the initiative of the Government criminal proceedings were started against that organisation, with a request for a sentence of imprisonment on all its officers and the closing of its offices, because the C.G.T had approved a "" Battle Plan "" comprising social, economic and political objectives. Since its claims were going unheeded, the C.G.T had decided to start the occupation of factories in order to back up its demands. As a result the chairmen and general secretaries of over  organisations were charged with breaches of state security and incitement to commit offences. The detention was ordered of  union leaders.
.In its reply of  November  the Government stated (see paragraph  of the rd Report) that the execution of the so-called Battle Plan involved the commission of offences under the Penal Code, including dispossession of property and the unlawful detention of members of the staff of the undertakings concerned. The Government argued that such action had been taken not in consequence of a labour dispute with the undertakings in question but as part of a political plan. The Government pointed out that none of the trade union leaders against whom proceedings had been initiated had been kept in custody.
.In paragraph  of its rd Report the Committee recalled that it had always applied the principle that allegations respecting the right to strike were not outside its competence in so far as they affected the exercise of trade union rights. It had also pointed out that the right of workers and their organisations to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests was generally recognised. The Committee had, however, also held that the restriction of political strikes and strikes to coerce the government or the community to recognise certain action was not an infringement of trade union rights.
.The Committee observed that in the present case the object of the strike was to exert pressure on the Government and so oblige it to proceed to certain measures of an economic, social and political character, and that, moreover, the movement was accompanied by the occupation of a number of establishments and the prevention in some cases of free movement on the part of senior employees of the undertakings concerned. The Committee concluded that the proceedings entered against the trade unionists involved did not justify the allegation that trade union rights had been infringed. Nevertheless, since the complainants had also alleged that the principal officers of over  unions had been charged with security offences and that these various cases were now before the courts, the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the exact character of the offences with which the said trade union officers were charged, and to keep it posted about any new development in this connection.
.When the case came before it again at its November  meeting, the Committee observed that in referring to this aspect of the case in its communication of  August  the Government had confined itself to stating that it had asked the judicial authorities for the relevant information. The Committee therefore decided to repeat its previous request and to postpone examination of this aspect of the case pending receipt of the additional information requested from the Government.
.By a communication dated  March  the Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic in Geneva forwarded the Government's reply to the request for further information. The Government begins by supplying certain details with regard to the proceedings against the  trade union leaders indicted in connection with the adoption of the Battle Plan, on which the Committee has already commented in its rd Report (see paragraph  above). The information now supplied by the Government includes the names of the officials in question and makes it clear that they were charged with incitement to commit an offence, which is an offence under section  of the Penal Code, in that they were responsible for the forceful measures agreed upon at the meetings of the C.G.T held on  and  January . The Government also states that, although a judge had ordered the detention of the accused in December , they were all subsequently released without prejudice to the pursuance of their case.
.The Government also gives information with regard to the proceedings against three other trade unionists. Mr. Felipe Ernesto Luduea, Trade Union Secretary of the Peronist Revolutionary Movement, who had held office with the Santa Cruz branch of the Naval Dockyard and Tanker Building Workers' Union, was charged in March  with infringement of section  of the Penal Code, which prescribes penalties for various acts of a terrorist nature. A provisional stay of proceedings was granted in April . Mr. Carlos Kristoff, Deputy Secretary of the Plumbing, Sewage, Waterworks and Allied Workers' Union, was charged in September  with interference with freedom to",1,1964,Argentina
383,"work and causing bodily harm, but was subsequently released without prejudice to the pursuance of his case. Mr. Ral Alberto Garcia, a member of the executive of the Federation of Wage-Earning and Salaried Telephone Employees of the Argentine Republic, was charged on  December  with intimidation of the public. He was subsequently released, and his case was finally dismissed on  December .
.Finally, the Government declares that at the present time there is not a single person held in custody in Argentina on political or trade union grounds, and that all the police and legal action referred to was taken on account of offences against public order or common law offences.
.It would appear from the information supplied by the Government that the  trade union leaders indicted in connection with the adoption of the Battle Plan were charged purely with the offence provided for in section  of the Penal Code, namely incitement to commit an offence, and not with breaches of state security, as has been alleged in the complaint. The Committee notes that these persons, whose detention was ordered during the initial proceedings, have now been released without prejudice to the pursuance of their case.
.With regard to the three trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above, who were arraigned individually, the Committee observes that although all three have been released, two of them, Messrs. Luduea and Kristoff, appear to be still subject to the jurisdiction of the criminal courts for the offences with which they have been charged. It is not clear whether these offences have any connection with the acts imputed to the  trade unionists mentioned earlier, and the Committee would therefore be grateful if the Government would inform it as to the exact nature of the offences with which Messrs. Luduea and Kristoff are charged and to keep it informed of any new development with respect to the legal position of these trade unionists.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while taking note of the Government's statement in its communication of  March  to the effect that at the present time nobody is held in custody in Argentina on political or trade union grounds, and that the trade union leaders indicted in connection with the adoption of the C.G.T's Battle Plan were charged purely with incitement to commit an offence, to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any new development with respect to the situation regarding the proceedings concerning these officials, and to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further when it has received the additional information to be requested from the Government in pursuance of paragraph  above.
.This case was examined previously by the Committee at its th Session (May ), when it submitted an interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session.
.In paragraph  of this report the Committee, having examined the allegations of the complainants and the reply of the Government, set forth certain recommendations and a request for information in the following terms:With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to non-attendance by the Argentine Workers' delegation at the th Session of the International Labour Conference, to decide that there would be no object in continuing to examine this aspect of the case;(b) as regards the allegations relating to interference by public authorities in the finances of trade unions, to take note of Argentine legislation on the supervision of administration of trade union property and funds, to call the Government's attention to the considerations set out in paragraphs  to  above, and to invite it to re-examine the said legislation in the light thereof, particularly as regards the reference of the results of administrative audits to a law court so as to ensure due process of law and, if appropriate, application of sanctions by the court;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the information from the Government referred to in paragraph  above..The Government sent additional information in a communication dated  August .
.The Government sent additional information in a communication dated  August .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In view of the foregoing the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information it has decided to request from the Government, as indicated in paragraph  above.
.The complaints by the General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.) are contained in communications dated  May, ,  and  June and  September , all of which were sent directly to the I.L.O. They describe alleged violations of trade union rights in Argentina. The above communications were transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations by letter dated  November .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to non-attendance by the Argentine Workers' delegation at the th Session of the International Labour Conference, to decide that there would be no object in continuing to examine this aspect of the case;(b) as regards the allegations relating to interference by public authorities in the finances of trade unions, to take note of Argentine legislation on the supervision of administration of trade union property and funds, to call the Government's attention to the considerations set out in paragraphs  to  above, and to invite it to re-examine the said legislation in the light thereof, particularly as regards the reference of the results of administrative audits to a law court so as to ensure due process of law and, if appropriate, application of sanctions by the court;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the information from the Government referred to in paragraph  above.",1,1964,Argentina
384,".The complaint by the Textile Workers' Association was submitted in a letter dated  November  sent direct to the I.L.O. It was then forwarded to the Argentine Government with a covering letter dated  November  for its observations, which were forwarded on  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint the Textile Workers' Association, an Argentine trade union organisation, claims that the Government has violated Article  of Convention No.  and section  of the Trade Union Act (No. ) by deliberately ending the term of office of the Association's senior officials and appointing Government administrators under Order No. / issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.In its reply the Government stated that section  of the ministerial order referred to was rescinded by Order No. /, a copy of which was attached. The preamble to Order No. / stated that the Ministry had power to take over control of the assets of trade unions with incorporated status in special circumstances (usually where the term of office of the executive committee was extended in violation of the relevant legislation and the union's own rules). The Government explained that such emergency measures did not involve interference in the work of the unions, but merely constituted a safeguard to protect the members' interests. The preamble of the order stated that a co-administrator would only be appointed for the remaining term of office of the present officials of the Textile Workers' Association, who were responsible for the management of the union's assets. The Government explained in its letter that when the Association made an application for the withdrawal of Ministerial Order No. /, section  of that order was rescinded under a later Order No. /.
.The Committee notes, in short, that according to the complainants, the Ministry issued an order appointing an official administrator for the Textile Workers' Association in violation of section  of Act No.  as well as of Article  of Convention No. , under which workers' organisations are entitled to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, while the public authorities are required to refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.The Government for its part states that Order No. / was only issued in order to safeguard the union's assets and that it was for this purpose that a co-administrator was appointed. Furthermore, when an appeal was made section  of the order was rescinded.
.It would appear from the information supplied that the Ministry appointed a co-administrator in the special situation created when the term of office of the executive committee of the Textile Workers' Association was extended in violation of the law and the union's own rules. It would also appear that the co-administrator was appointed by virtue of section  of Order No. /, which was later rescinded. The complainants allege that this measure involves a breach, not only of Article  of the Convention, but also of section  of Act No. , which is worded as follows:In no circumstances shall the enforcing authority have the power to intervene in the management or the administration of the occupational associations covered by this Act.
.The Committee recalls that in a number of other cases dealing with Argentina, it has had to examine the problem of government intervention in the affairs of a trade union. In these cases, the Governing Body decided to call the Government's attention to the importance it attaches to the principle explicitly set forth in Article  of Convention No.  (ratified by Argentina) that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.In the present case, it would appear that the Ministry of Labour appointed a co-administrator in special circumstances for a short period and in order to safeguard the union's own assets. When the complainants appealed against this order it was rescinded.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while calling the Government's attention once more to the principle embodied in Article  of Convention No. , to note that the measure which led to the complaint being submitted has been revoked.",0,1963,Argentina
385,".The complaint of the Union of Postal and Telecommunications Workers of Mar del Plata is contained in a communication dated  April  to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In accordance with current procedure the Secretary-General transmitted this complaint to the I.L.O in a letter dated  June . The complaint was communicated to the Government, which forwarded its observations in a letter dated  December .
.The Committee examined the complaint and the Government's observations at its meeting in February  and decided to ask the Government for certain additional information and, in the meantime, to postpone its examination of the case as a whole.
.In a letter dated  May  the Government supplied the information that had been requested.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege in their communication that, as a result of a dispute -ending in a strike-which took place between the Union of Postal and Telecommunications Workers of Mar del Plata and the State Communications Department because of delays in the payment of the monthly salaries of the staff of the Postal and Telecommunications Administration, the said Administration, as a reprisal, terminated the contracts of  employees, members of trade unions, at the central Mar del Plata office, who had taken part in the strike. In the view of the complainants this step was an arbitrary one. It was alleged to be based on the provisions of section  (a) of Decree No. / (Rules of Civilian State Personnel) respecting unjustified absences by public servants. The complainants state that in accordance with article bis of the National Constitution cases of absence due to strike reasons cannot be considered to be unjustified. The complainants attach to their communication a list of the names of the  persons alleged to have been dismissed at the Mar del Plata. They add that in the whole country , workers were dismissed in this way.
.In its reply dated  December  the Government admits that delays due to the economic difficulties affecting the country did, in fact, take place in the payment of the salaries of state employees. It points out, nevertheless, that the telecommunications staff were among those who were least adversely affected in this respect, since the Finance Secretariat had authorised, for the payment of salaries for this category of officials, the utilisation of revenue which would normally have been paid direct to the Treasury.
.The Government also mentions that at the beginning of August  an inter-union commission, including representatives of the Argentine Association of Telegraphists and Radio Telegraphists (A.A.T.R.A.) and the Federation of Workers and Employees in Postal and Telecommunications Services (F.O.E.C.Y.T.) held negotiations with officials of the State Communications Secretariat for the purpose of obtaining a solution of the question of the payment of salaries for the month of July. Following these negotiations, so the Government declares, these two central trade union bodies informed the various affiliated unions through the medium of the press that they were to refrain from striking as from  August , since an arrangement had been made so that salaries in arrears would be paid as from  August. At that moment an isolated group of telegraph officials ceased work without having given notice of the strike. As the movement spread the Government issued an order to the trade union organisations forbidding them to have recourse to strike action. The strike continued, however, and the Government then withdrew the legal status of the two central trade union bodies mentioned above.
.The Government states that from the beginning the strike was only a partial one involving no more than  per cent of the workers, which percentage was soon reduced to . Seeing that the strike had not been valid, F.O.E.C.Y.T decided to put an end to the movement, and A.A.T.R.A followed suit. In these circumstances the two organisations had their legal status restored. As regards the dismissals, the Government declares that they were carried out under section  (a) of Decree No. /, which provides that unjustified absence of more than ten days, whether consecutive or not, constitutes a ground for dismissal. The Government adds that the majority of the persons in question, even before the strike began, had been guilty of unjustified absence exceeding the number of days prescribed by the section mentioned above.
.The Committee has always applied the principle that allegations relating to the exercise of the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far, but only in so far, as they affect the exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee observed, at its meeting in February  on the subject of the dispute itself, that after some vicissitudes-negotiations, agreement, strikes, withdrawal of trade union status, ending of the strike and restoration of trade union status-the situation had returned to normal. In the circumstances, the Committee did not consider that there was any ground for pursuing its consideration of this aspect of the case.
.As regards the complaint proper the Committee observed that, while the complainants invoked article bis of the Constitution to show that the dismissals were illegal in character, the Government relied on the provisions of Decree No. / to justify the dismissals. Under article bis of the Constitution "" Labour shall be protected by laws guaranteeing... protection against arbitrary dismissals."" and "" trade unions shall be guaranteed the right to strike."". On the other hand, the grounds for dismissal stipulated in section  (a) of Decree No. / include a period of more than ten days, whether consecutive or not, of unjustified absence in the course of a year.
.The Committee took the view that days of absence resulting from a lawful strike could not, in view of the provisions of article bis of the Constitution, be regarded as unjustified absence within the meaning of section  (a) of Decree No. /. It considered, furthermore, that if it were intended to invoke the last-named provision, it should be clearly established that the action taken was quite independent of any consideration other than the fact that a fault had been committed by those who were affected by this action.
.The Committee felt that the Government's statements did not make it clear that the measures taken against the workers mentioned by the complainants were not related to the strike. The fact that the Government invoked as an additional argument the point that the majority of the workers affected had already been absent for more than ten days by the time the strike began would even tend to prove the contrary. In any event, it did not provide a valid explanation for the action taken in regard to the minority of the workers at issue. Moreover, as was seen previously, it is only in the case of a legal strike that article bis of the Constitution can be validly invoked. It was not clear from the Government's reply whether the strike action was illegal because it was started in defiance of a directive from the central trade union bodies or because due notice had not been given.
.Accordingly, the Committee decided, at its meeting in February , to ask the Government to supply certain additional information. It was asked to indicate, in respect of each of the dismissed workers-whose names have been supplied by the complainants what were the precise reasons for the action taken against them and whether the strike in question was regarded by the Government as illegal and, if so, by virtue of what statutory or other provisions.
.In its reply dated  May  the Government states (as it had in earlier cases) that these workers were employed by state-operated public services and their right to strike was subject to restrictions which were universally admitted by international law and practice and by the Committee on Freedom of Association itself. The Government points out that the Committee has repeatedly admitted that the general principle that workers and their organisations are entitled to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests may be subject to restrictions both in essential services and in the civil service. In these cases the Committee has stressed the importance of providing some procedure to ensure peaceful settlement of such disputes, so that the workers who are deprived of an essential means of occupational defence-such as a legal strike-may have appropriate guarantees.
.The Government states that postal and telecommunications employees, in their capacity as public servants, are not allowed to engage in strike action of the type attempted by a minority of these workers. In the event of a dispute there is a procedure laid down by Decree No.  dated  September , which takes into account the Committee's comments on Case No. , which also concerned Argentina. Section  of this decree states that disputes which may directly or indirectly cause the suspension, interruption, paralysis or denial of essential public services must be submitted to arbitration. If, in a case",0,1963,Argentina
386,"of this type, the arbitrators appointed by the parties to the dispute are unable to agree, a third arbitrator is appointed by lot from the list of co-judges of the Argentine Supreme Court. Section  declares any strikes to be illegal which affect the essential public services referred to in the previous section. It also defines communications as an essential public service.
.With respect to the dismissals mentioned by the complainants the Government declares that "" there were no dismissals because of the dispute itself "". In other words no worker was laid off because of his trade union activities, and the only ground for dismissal was serious breach of the Rules of Civilian State Personnel. Civil servants and public employees enjoy every legal protection, such as habeas corpus and the right to appeal in defending their rights.
.Finally, the Government informs the Committee that in May  the Secretary for Communications announced the reinstatement of all the workers who had been dismissed under the Rules of Civilian State Personnel.
.The Committee notes with interest the information supplied by the Government with respect to Decree No.  of , whereby disputes in essential public services are submitted to an independent tribunal. The Committee likewise notes that the Government emphasises that the workers were dismissed not because of the dispute but because they had broken the Rules of Civilian State Personnel. Nevertheless, in view of the considerations put forward earlier in paragraph , it would appear that the Government took action against the participants in the strike not because of a breach of the regulations governing disputes in essential public services but because of absenteeism for a longer period than permitted by the Rules; in the majority of cases this absenteeism had occurred before the dispute. In other words, although technically the dismissals appear to have been a punishment for breach of the Rules independently of the strike, in actual fact the dismissals were directly connected with the latter.
.The Committee considers that in questions of this type it has a duty to look beyond the technical aspect of the action taken and to examine the substance of the question and its consequences for the workers and organisations involved. Even though the type of action taken in the case of these dismissals might, in certain circumstances, constitute discrimination against workers because of their trade union activities, the Committee bears in mind the fact that under Decree No.  disputes in essential public services must be submitted to an arbitration tribunal and that workers are not allowed to resort to strike action. It follows that the workers' action would have been illegal and there would be no grounds for considering that the Government took discriminatory measures against workers who were engaged in lawful activities of a trade union character.
.Furthermore, the Government states that in the meantime all the individuals who were dismissed under the Rules of Civilian State Personnel have now been reinstated. Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of this fact and to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1963,Argentina
387,".The complaint by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  May  addressed directly to the I.L.O. This communication was accompanied by a memorandum from the Federation of Telephone Workers and Employees of the Argentine Republic (F.O.E.T.R.A.) and by a number of documents in support of the complaint. The complaint was transmitted to the Government, which submitted its comments in a note dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that, under the provisions in force in Argentina, since the parties have been unable to reach agreement on the conclusion of a new agreement the provisions of the previous agreement remain in force. The Committee further notes, with respect to the complainants' accusation that the company has violated the provisions of the agreement, that section  of Act No.  provides for penalties and for appropriate action to secure compliance with an agreement. In this case it does not appear that the workers have taken advantage of the relevant provisions in order to defend their rights.
.In similar cases' in the past the Committee has taken the view that, where there has been failure to have recourse to appropriate national remedies with respect to matters raised in a complaint, the complainants have not offered sufficient evidence to show that an infringement of trade union rights has occurred. In the light of the facts referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Committee must reach the same conclusion in the present case.
.The complainants base their accusation of unfair practices by the company on subsections (b), (d) and (f) of section  of Act No.  concerning industrial associations of employees. The subsections in question relate to intervention by employers in the Constitution, operation or administration of an industrial association of employees, encouraging staff to join particular associations and refusal to bargain collectively with employees in accordance with the legal procedure.
.With respect to the last point, the Committee notes that in the present case the parties were unable to reach agreement in spite of the fact that a number of meetings were held. According to the complainants, the last meeting took place on  March  and ended with the refusal of the workers' representatives to accept a proposal made by the employers. The Committee recalls that in a previous case it pointed out that no provision of Article  of Convention No.  obliges the government concerned to give effect to the principle of collective bargaining by coercive measures which would change the nature of such bargaining. The Committee further pointed out that whether one of the parties adopts a conciliatory attitude or an intransigent attitude with respect to the demands of the other party is a matter for negotiation between the parties in accordance with the law of the country concerned.
.The complainants further accuse the employers of resorting to unfair practices as defined by national legislation because they negotiated directly with the workers. This allegation is made in the general petition submitted by F.O.E.T.R.A to the National Labour-Management Relations Board on the grounds of unfair practices on the part of the Company. No information concerning the result of that petition has been submitted to the Committee. The Committee has previously considered a case in which it was alleged that the legislation permitted the conclusion of collective agreements between the undertaking and  per cent of its workers outside the framework of a trade union organisation. In respect of that case, the Committee took the view that direct bargaining between an undertaking and its workers outside the framework of existing representative organisations may in certain cases be detrimental to the principle laid down in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), that governments shall encourage and promote collective bargaining between employers' and workers' organisations. According to the Government, in the present case the direct offer made by the Company to its workers was merely a repetition of the proposals previously made to the trade union, which had rejected them. In other words, it was not an attempt to engage directly in collective bargaining with the workers outside the framework of their organisation. Moreover, the Committee notes that negotiations between the Company and the trade union were subsequently resumed. This allegation on the part of the complainants therefore relates to their earlier contention that the Company refused to negotiate with F.O.E.T.R.A. In the light of the facts set out in the previous paragraphs, the Committee considers that the complainants have not demonstrated that there has been a violation of trade union rights.
.Finally, with respect to the allegation that the Company has interfered with the workers' organisation and encouraged its staff to join another organisation, the Committee points out that this allegation is couched in extremely vague terms and that the complainants have submitted no evidence in support of their complaint.
.In the light of all these circumstances, the Committee has reached the conclusion, as regards both the allegations of non-compliance with the collective agreement and the other allegations of unfair practices by the Company, that the complainants have not furnished sufficient proof in support of their complaint to the I.L.O.",0,1963,Argentina
388,".The complaint lodged by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions was contained in a communication sent directly to the International Labour Office on  September . The Argentine Government sent its observations in a note dated  January . The Committee examined the complaint at its February  meeting and decided to ask the Government for further information. The Government sent new information in notes dated  April and  May . At its November  meeting the Committee examined the case afresh, arriving at certain conclusions, and again decided to request the Government for further information. The Government replied by a communication dated  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Although the Government did not reply fully to the request for information, the Committee gathers from its reply that as soon as the administrative resolutions withdrawing legal personality and trade union status from the organisations concerned were issued, the said measures and their consequences for trade union rights of these organisations became immediately effective. In practice, the organisations in question only appear to have recovered the rights conferred by Act No.  upon occupational associations with legal personality and trade union status after these resolutions had been reversed by a court decision or when the Ministry of Labour and Social Security had issued fresh resolutions restoring legal personality and trade union status to the union concerned.
.In view of the foregoing, and bearing in mind the powers conferred by the above Act on occupational associations with legal personality and trade union status, the Committee considers that the possibility under Argentine legislation of the adoption with immediate effect of such measures as the suspension or dissolution of a workers' organisation by administrative authority constitutes a violation of the provisions of Article  of Convention No. . In matters of this kind the Committee must look beyond the form of the action taken to its substantial nature and effect. While the organisations in question may not have been formally suspended or dissolved, the action taken in respect of them is tantamount to suspension or dissolution in its practical effect. The Convention as a guarantee of a fundamental freedom is concerned not only with words but also with realities, and the Committee must therefore look beyond the form to the substance.
.As the Committee has already had occasion to emphasise in the past, where suspension measures are issued by administrative authority, there may be a danger that they will appear to be arbitrary, even though they are issued only temporarily or for a limited time as a preliminary to subsequent court action. Accordingly, the Committee considers that for the satisfactory application of the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , it is not sufficient for legislation to grant the right of appeal against suspension or dissolution decisions issued by administrative authority, but such decisions should not come into effect until the statutory period has expired, without an appeal being lodged, or until they have been confirmed by a court verdict.
.As already pointed out in connection with the refusal to register a trade union, and in accordance with the observations made by the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the Committee would emphasise that if the administrative authority has a discretionary right to register or cancel the registration of a trade union, the existence of a procedure of appeal to the courts does not appear to be a sufficient guarantee; in effect this does not alter the nature of the powers conferred on the administrative authorities, and the judges hearing such an appeal would only be able to ensure that the legislation had been correctly applied. Accordingly, the Committee must emphasise the importance which it attaches to judges being able to obtain information concerning the background of a case, to enable them to decide whether or not the provisions on which the administrative measures appealed against are based constitute a violation of the rights accorded to occupational organisations by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Argentine Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, which stipulates that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(b) to request the Argentine Government to examine the possibility of amending the provisions of its legislation in the light of the two preceding paragraphs;(c) to bring these conclusions to the notice of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The complaint lodged by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions was contained in a communication sent directly to the International Labour Office on  September . The Argentine Government sent its observations in a note dated  January . The Committee examined the complaint at its February  meeting and decided to ask the Government for further information. The Government sent new information in notes dated  April and  May .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee, although it recognises that under Argentine labour laws-as stated by the Government-the withdrawal of legal personality and trade union status from an organisation does not entail its dissolution, recalls that in previous cases concerning Argentina it stated that ""from the strictly trade union point of view... the role assigned to these organisations (without legal status) is extremely limited"" and that, ""in view of the statutory distinction between organisations having trade union status and ordinary trade unions, it would seem that organisations which do not have trade union status do not have the right to organise in freedom their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes"".
.The Committee observed that in the present case the allegations submitted by the complainants as well as the Government's reply and the text of Act No.  concerning workers' occupational associations fail to show clearly whether the withdrawal of legal personality and trade union status became effective as soon as resolutions'' Nos. /, / and / were issued, and these rights were not restored, in the case of the Buenos Aires Printing and Allied Trades Federation and the Federation of Salaried and Wage-Earning Postal and Telecommunications Employees, until the National Chamber of Appeals in Labour Matters had reversed these resolutions, or whether the legal personality and trade union status of these organisations were maintained during the period between the date on which the administrative resolutions withdrawing legal personality and trade union status were issued and the date on which, the court decision reversing these resolutions was handed down, or whether they were restored only after the date on which these organisations lodged their appeal. In these circumstances the Committee decided to request the Argentine Government for additional information regarding this aspect of the case and the situation respecting the appeal lodged by the Argentine Textile Workers' Association.
.By its note of  April  the Government sent a copy of resolution No.  of  March  in which it decided to restore the legal personality and trade union status of the Argentine Textile Workers' Association. In its communication of  May  the Government sent copies of resolutions Nos.  and  withdrawing the legal personality and trade union status of the Buenos Aires Printing and Allied Trades Federation and the Federation of Salaried and Wage-Earning Postal and Telecommunications Employees. The Committee observed that the Government has failed to reply to the question regarding the immediate practical effects of the resolutions withdrawing legal personality and trade union status from those unions.
.In view of the fact that Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), provides that ""workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority"", the Committee again requests the Government to state whether withdrawal of legal personality and trade union status from the Buenos Aires Printing and Allied Trades Federation, the Federation of Salaried and Wage-Earning Postal and Telecommunications Employees and the Argentine Textile Workers' Association became effective as soon as the respective resolutions were issued and whether such personality and status were restored to these organisations only when the National Chamber of Appeals in Labour Matters gave its decision, or when subsequent resolutions were issued restoring such personality and status, or whether these organisations retained their legal personality and trade union status at all times.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that the allegation relating to the withdrawal of legal personality",0,1962,Argentina
389,"and trade union status from the Argentine Printing and Allied Trades Federation does not call for further examination;(b) to take note of the present interim report concerning the allegations relating to withdrawal of legal personality and trade union status from the Buenos Aires Printing and Allied Trades Federation, the Federation of Salaried and Wage Earning Postal and Telecommunications Employees, and the Argentine Textile Workers' Association, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the information again requested from the Argentine Government.",-1,1962,Argentina
390,".By a communication dated  November  "" The Brotherhood "" (Railway Locomotive Personnel Union) filed a complaint with the I.L.O against the Argentine Government for violation of freedom of association.
.By two communications dated  December  the complaint was communicated to the Government for its observations, and "" The Brotherhood "" was informed of its right to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month.
.By a communication of  January  "" The Brotherhood "" replied that for the time being it had no arguments to add, but that if the contrary should be the case it would supply them within the prescribed time.
.At its th, st, nd and rd Sessions, the Committee, having received no reply from the Government, decided to defer examination of the case. The said reply was received on  February  only.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant states that in March  it requested of the Argentine State Railways Company an increase in wages for the locomotive personnel of the railways which it represented. On their side, the authorities of the state-owned railways proposed the application of a plan to eliminate the operating deficit. To that end the Government issued Decree No. /, which set up consultative committees with trade union representation to advise on the measures to be adopted in implementation of the plan.
.Subsequently the Executive Power placed the state railways under supervision and by Decree No. / the supervisor was granted emergency powers to carry out another railway plan. The clauses of the decree included one to permit the introduction of "" those modifications of the present labour regulations which may be required "". The committees created by Decree No. / found themselves hampered in their work and in the end were dissolved with no account taken of their recommendations.
.In consequence of a protest work stoppage, an agreement was signed on  May  between representatives of the Government and of the trade union organisations, "" The Brotherhood "" and the Railway Union, whereby committees were to be set up to study the workers' claims. Notwithstanding this, the Government decided to continue with its plan for reorganising the railways without the collaboration of the workers. Following a series of incidents, resolution No. /, dated  June , was issued, creating a committee made up of state and trade union representatives to study the claims and the appropriate modifications to the labour regulations. In other words the Government wanted to link a discussion of wage increases with amendments to the railway labour regulations. This point of view was not accepted by the complainant, who pressed for the implementation of the substance of the agreement of  May .
.In the face of a series of protest work stoppages a new agreement was signed between the above-mentioned trade union organisations and a government representative on  August . However, the provisions of this agreement were not carried out, for which state representatives on the various committees were to blame since they went on to set certain conditions which the workers could not accept. After a series of protest work stoppages and in view of the fact that steps had been taken towards mass dismissals and a change of the regulations on conditions of work, both "" The Brotherhood "" and the Railway Union decided to call a strike for an indefinite period as from  October .
.Despite the Government's declared intention of respecting the right to strike as laid down in the Constitution, the authorities summoned the staff to return to work on pain of being declared "" on assignment "" (en comisin), which amounted to threatening them with loss of conditions of acquired seniority (escalafonamiento), grading, job, etc. This attempt at intimidation did not have the desired effect and so the Government issued Decree No. /  requisitioning railway workers. This decree, issued in virtue of authority granted to the Executive Power under the law on the state of emergency and the National Organisation (Wartime) Act (No. ), was applied at first to railway personnel in the federal capital and within a radius of  kilometres and was extended on  November to the whole of the national territory. "" The Brotherhood "" presented an appeal for "" protection "" (amparo) at law but this was rejected.
."" The Brotherhood's "" charges against the Government are that it issued a decree requisitioning railway personnel on pain of  days' arrest for non-compliance; that the police broke into and exercised surveillance of homes, public meeting places and union premises, preventing meetings of workers and terrorising them; that officials of "" The Brotherhood "", despite their trade union status, were included in the requisition; that the railway labour regulations were amended unilaterally; that economic pressure was applied to the unions since, for over six months, dues collected by the check-off system had not been transferred to the union.
.In its reply the Government points out that the dispute has been altogether terminated by the provisions of Decree No. , dated  December . In accordance with this decree there is one representative each of "" The Brotherhood "" and of the Railway Union on the Board of Management of the State Railways. Where the strike itself is concerned, the Government states that a strike was called without recourse to the compulsory conciliation procedure established by Legislative Decree No. / (confirmed by Act No. ) and by Act No. . On the other hand, the abandonment of trains and other acts against the security of means of transport and communication are offences under the Penal Code and under Act No. . These facts and the Government's responsibility for ensuring the continuous operation of the public railway service caused the Executive Power of the nation to declare this situation a serious emergency warranting, in accordance with Acts Nos.  and , the use of police and security powers a required to ensure the regular and continuous operation of public services (Decree No. /, section ).
.The requisition order in no way implies repression on the part of the Government, whose only motive was the defence of the general interests of the country. The said decree is based on Act No. , which in its turn is founded on several articles of the national Constitution. As regards the unilateral amendment of the labour regulations, the Government states that the provisions issued for the purpose never came into force. Finally, on the non-transfer of union dues, the Government points out that according to the complainant union itself, the Argentine State Railways Company was already six months in arrears of transfer, which shows that there was no intention to cause "" The Brotherhood "" economic prejudice on account of the strike, and that the delay was attributable to the abnormal economic situation of the Argentine public treasury and railways.
.The Committee has been guided by the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are within its competence in so far, but only in so far, as they affect the exercise of trade union rights.
.In an earlier case relating to Argentina, the Committee had occasion to examine the question of the mobilisation of workers on account of a railway strike. Although in the present circumstances requisition only is involved, a measure less serious in its implications than mobilisation, it nevertheless remains exceptional in a labour dispute in view of the gravity of its consequences with regard to personal freedoms and trade union rights. In the case in question, the Government had availed itself of Act No. , section , which states that:The mobilisation of the auxiliary forces may only be decreed by the Government when this is necessary for purposes of national defence or in the event of catastrophes or serious emergencies which affect substantial sections of the country or its population.On that occasion the Committee considered that there did not seem to have existed a state of acute national emergency, such as had been observed in a case relating to the United States in which it had been necessary to ensure the delivery of supplies and ammunition to the troops of the United Nations engaged in Korea, to justify the mobilisation of workers on account of the dispute in progress as the Government had merely invoked its anxiety not to see the development of the national economy jeopardised by the strike.
.In the present case, when the strike finally broke out after a series of negotiations, stoppages and agreements signed between the parties to the dispute, the Government argues on the one hand that the complainant did not follow the compulsory conciliation procedures established by Decree No. / and Act No. , unlawfully exercising the right to strike, and that, on the other hand, the acts against the means of transport and the need to maintain an important public service such as the",0,1962,Argentina
391,"railways caused the Government of the nation to regard this situation as a "" serious emergency "" justifying recourse to requisition.
.In regard to the compulsory conciliation procedure to which the complainant should have submitted, this appears to be governed by Decree No. / relating to labour conflicts in state-owned undertakings. The Committee has already had occasion to examine this decree in a previous case. Under it, if a direct agreement between the parties to the dispute is not reached, the dispute shall be settled by the Executive Power, after consultation with the Ministry of Labour. Before the matter is brought before the Executive Power the parties may submit a brief regarding their rights. In consequence of the system established by the decree, strikes by the workers of the Argentine State Railways Company would seem to be prohibited. From the evidence in the Committee's possession, it appears that the procedures laid down in Decree No. / have not been followed. Furthermore, although the Government refers to compulsory conciliation established by the decree, it would appear that these conciliation procedures were not included in its terms, since once the direct negotiations between the parties are broken off, it is the Executive Power that decides, after consultation with the Ministry of Labour.
.The Committee has noted in many previous cases  that the right to strike may be subject to restrictions in essential occupations and in the civil service. In such cases the Committee has stressed the importance it attaches to the provision of some procedure that will ensure peaceful settlement of such disputes so that the workers who are deprived of the right to strike may have appropriate guarantees. Consequently the Committee is bound to arrive at the same conclusion as in the previous case in which it examined Decree No. /, when it considered that the system imposed thereby for the settlement of disputes in state-owned undertakings was not in accordance with the above-mentioned principles.
.Consequently, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government once again, as it did in the case in which it examined Decree No. / , to the desirability of investing the existing system for the settlement of disputes in state-owned undertakings with the guarantee of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage.
.With regard to the situation where a "" serious emergency "" justifies, in the eyes of the Government, recourse to the measure of requisition, the Committee recalls that, in an earlier case in which the government concerned used army technicians to maintain the telephone service, interrupted by a strike, it considered that, where an essential public service such as the telephone service is interrupted by an unlawful strike, a government may have to assume the responsibility of ensuring its maintenance, in the interests of the community and of public order, and, to this end, may consider it expedient to call in persons from the armed services or other services to perform the duties which have been suspended. In another previous case, the Committee considered that the employment of the armed forces or of another group of persons to perform duties which have been suspended as the result of a labour dispute can - if the strike is lawful-be justified only by the need to ensure the working of services or industries whose suspension would lead to an acute crisis and that the utilisation by the Government of labour drawn from outside the trade, with a view to replacing the striking workers, entails a risk of derogation from the right to strike which may affect the free exercise of trade union rights.
.In the present case the Committee, observing that the Government gives as a reason justifying the measure of requisition the need to maintain an important public service, considers, as it did in an earlier case relating to a railway strike in Argentina, that the Government has not furnished evidence to show that there existed a situation of acute national crisis, such as had existed in Case No.  referred to in paragraph  above, which would have warranted a measure of this kind, which implies serious consequences for workers and for their trade union rights and which may involve abuse during a labour dispute.
.Further, the complainant alleges that trade union meetings have been prevented or rendered difficult and that the police have occupied trade union premises. Though the Committee has no more precise information about these facts, they were not denied by the Government in its reply. In this regard the Committee has already pointed out on a previous occasion that the measures taken by the authorities to ensure the observance of the law should not result in preventing unions from organising meetings during labour disputes. The Committee has also emphasised, while recognising that trade unions, like other associations or persons, cannot claim immunity from search of their premises, the importance which it attaches to the principle that any such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists in the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the possibility of abuse involved in the requisition of workers during industrial disputes and to emphasise the undesirability of recourse to such measures except for the purpose of maintaining essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle that measures taken by the authorities to ensure the observance of the law should not result in preventing unions from organising meetings during labour disputes, and to the principle that any search of trade union premises should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",3,1962,Argentina
392,".The Committee has already examined this case at its th Session (May ) and, with the exception of one allegation by the complainants, submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body concerning the case as a whole. These conclusions were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.At its meeting in May  the Committee further examined this case, considering the sole allegation which remained outstanding, namely the alleged refusal by the management of the National Bank to comply with certain court orders in respect of the trade union leader Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio, and made the following recommendation to the Governing Body (paragraph  of its nd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session in June )In consequence the Committee recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government specifically whether the Labour Court of Appeal, before giving its final judgment, ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until such judgment was pronounced.
.The Argentine Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.By a communication dated  July  the Government forwarded certain additional information in relation to this allegation.
.The allegation still outstanding concerns the posting by the management of the National Bank of Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio, General Secretary of the Buenos Aires Bank Employees' Union (S.E.B.B.A.), to a branch  kilometres away from Buenos Aires - this is said to be a measure of anti-union discrimination - while at the same time an administrative charge was initiated against him designed to convert this posting into an outright dismissal.
.The LF.C.T.U stated that the S.E.B.B.A then applied to the judge for an injunction to prevent any modification in Mr. Robacio's position until judgment had been given in a lawsuit brought by the union. Although the judge granted this injunction, the Bank refused to comply with it, despite a further sentence by the same judge against the Chairman of the Bank for contempt of court. The Bank authorities having appealed against the labour judge's decision, the Labour Court of Appeal on  April  affirmed the interlocutory injunction granted by the judge. The National Bank refused to comply with this order also. These statements of the I.F.C.T.U have been supported by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Supervisors and Commercial Travellers.
.Having noted that the Government in its reply had refrained from making any comment on this point, the Committee took the view at its th Session (May ) that it would be advisable to adjourn examination of this particular aspect of the case pending receipt of information from the Government, and it made a recommendation to the Governing Body to this effect.
.The Committee's conclusions as adopted by the Governing Body, and in particular the request for information on the matters mentioned above, were brought to the notice of the Government by a letter from the Director-General dated  July .
.The Government replied by a communication dated  September . This reply, however, still contained no information on the points referred to above.
.In these circumstances the Committee at its th Session (November ) recommended the Governing Body to request the Government once again to furnish information in respect of the allegations to the effect that the management of the National Bank had not complied with the injunction granted by the labour judge, and subsequently affirmed by the Labour Court of Appeal, relating to the situation of the General Secretary of the S.E.B.B.A.
.In a communication dated  November  the Government forwarded further information concerning the allegation.
.In its communication dated  November  the Government stated that Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio's posting was a normal one for which provision was made in the statutory regulations governing public employees, and that in any case Mr. Robacio had not accepted his posting and had refused to take up the new duties assigned to him. The Government added that Mr. Robacio had then lodged an appeal for protection with the sitting labour judge, who ordered the Bank not to proceed with the posting, but the Bank had refused to acknowledge the competence of the labour court and lodged an appeal to have the decision quashed. The Labour Court of Appeal-continued the Government-had affirmed the decision in that the court was competent to hear the case, but quashed the judge's decision in favour of protection. The Government concluded by stating that Mr. Robacio had open to him all legal avenues for establishing his rights, "" which proved the existence of effective legal guarantees such as characterise a system of justice "".
.The Committee observed at its th (February ) Session that the complainants' statements and those of the Government were not in themselves contradictory with each other. The Committee also observed, however, that while the Government confirmed the complainants' statement to the effect that when Mr. Robacio had appealed to the labour judge for protection the latter had ordered the Bank not to proceed, and that later the Labour Court of Appeal had affirmed the decision as to the competence of the court to hear the case, it made no reference to the contempt of court, alleged by the complainants to have been committed by the National Bank in declining to accept the rulings of the labour judge and of the Labour Court of Appeal that it should not go forward with Mr. Robacio's posting.
.In these circumstances the Committee considered that it was essential, if it was to reach a decision on this aspect of the case, for it to know whether it was correct-as the complainants alleged-that the National Bank had on a number of occasions flouted the decisions of the judicial authorities and, if so, what measures had been taken by the Government in this respect.
.Furthermore, the Committee felt that it would be difficult for it to take a decision without knowing the exact circumstances surrounding this particular allegation, and to this end it would be advisable, in accordance with its usual practice, to request the Government to forward copies of the judgments, together with all the conclusions of law and findings of fact given in this connection by the judge of first instance and the Labour Court of Appeal, instead of a summary of the dispositive part of these judgments such as the Government had given in its communication of  November .
.In its communication of  April  the Government repeats what it stated in its communication of  November  and adds that "" it should be borne in mind that under Argentine law the lodging of an appeal in protection cases has a suspensive effect, whereby in virtue of the appeal by the President of the Argentine National Bank against the ruling of the judge of first instance the proceedings remained in a state of suspense until the Labour Court of Appeal pronounced its final judgment quashing the decision of the judge of first instance in favour of protection "". The Government adds that this procedural formula does not imply, "" as the complainants mistakenly claim, a refusal to bow to the authority of the judge of first instance "".
.The Committee observed at its preceding session (May ) that in its communication of  April the Government had affirmed that under Argentine law the lodging of an appeal in protection cases has a suspensive effect, and that in consequence there was a stay of execution of the ruling of the judge of first instance in the case in question until the Labour Court of Appeal pronounced its final judgment. The Committee also observed, however, that the complainants had alleged that the injunction not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting was granted in the first place by the judge of first instance and subsequently ( April ) affirmed by the Labour Court of Appeal. Noting that the Government, in its various communications, had never expressly denied that the Labour Court of Appeal-as alleged by the complainants-ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until final judgment was pronounced, the Committee felt that if it was to come to a decision in full awareness of the facts on this aspect of the complaint it would be helpful to have this point cleared up by the Argentine Government. Accordingly, it recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government specifically whether the Labour Court of Appeal, before giving its final judgment, ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until such judgment was pronounced.
.In its reply of  July  the Government states that at no stage did the Labour Court of Appeal issue an order not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting. Furthermore the Government repeats a number of minor points figuring in its previous statements, to the effect that the complainants confuse the machinery of appeal with suspensive effect and an alleged refusal to comply, which never occurred.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that the",-1,1961,Argentina
393,"Labour Court of Appeal at no time issued an order not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting; it would appear to follow from this answer that the National Bank did not refuse to comply with any decision by the Labour Court of Appeal, since the said Court did not issue an order "" not to proceed "" but did issue a decision by which-because it considered the application for protection to have been unfounded-it quashed the decision of the labour judge. It would seem, moreover, that Mr. Robacio had open to him all legal means of establishing his rights and that accordingly there is no further object in proceeding with this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the outstanding allegation relating to refusal by the National Bank to comply with certain court orders does not call for further examination.",2,1961,Argentina
394,".In a communication dated  March  addressed directly to the I.L.O the S.O.I.M.A submitted a complaint concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in Argentina. In a subsequent letter dated  May  the complainants forwarded additional information in support of their complaint.
.At its th Session (May ), the Committee, not having received the observations requested from the Government, decided to postpone its examination of the case until its next meeting. The Government was informed of this decision by a letter dated  June .
.The Government forwarded its observations in a letter dated  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that the S.O.I.M.A, which was established on  September  by workers in the stocking industry who had formerly belonged to the Association of Textile Workers (A.O.T.), applied to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on  March  for trade status "" which is essential in order to be able to act officially on behalf of the membership in dealings with the Government and the employers "". The complainants added that, in Government Order No.  dated  October  (a copy of which they appended), the Ministry of Labour refused to grant the status requested by the S.O.I.M.A.
.In explanation of this refusal of trade status, Order No.  states "" according to the information contained on page  the applicant organisation has  dues-paying members whereas the Association of Textile Workers of Argentina, as indicated on page , has , dues-paying members in the stocking industry in the federal capital and , in the rest of the country-a number which suffices in itself to invalidate the applicant's case "" and adds "" in the circumstances and in view of the statement on page  that there are , workers in that branch the applicant organisation cannot in any way be considered as representative "". It would appear that, in assessing the membership of the S.O.I.M.A in accordance with section  of Act No.  respecting industrial associations of employees I which runs as follows: "" Where an association with trade status already exists, such status shall not be granted to another association for the same activity unless the number of members paying contributions to the latter over a continuous period of at least six months immediately prior to its application was greater than the number of members belonging to the association already granted such status "", a comparison had been made between the number of dues-paying members of the S.O.I.M.A. (the complainants argue that this number does not correspond with the facts) and the number of dues-paying members of the A.O.T which covered the same industry and already possessed trade status.
.The complainants also allege that the Court of Appeal annulled the trade status which the Ministry of Labour had in fact granted to another union "" for the sane reasons which led the Ministry of Labour to refuse; t to ours "" and they attach a cutting on the subject taken from La Prensa dated  May .
.In its reply dated  September  the Government states that, according to official returns, the S.O.I.M.A has only , members whereas the A.O.T has a member-, ship of ,. The Government adds that the S.O.I.M.A is therefore in no way a representative trade union and that under section  of Act No.  trade status must be granted to the union with a membership of ,, i.e. the majority of workers employed in the industry, and not to a union with only , members.
.The Government gives the following explanations on this point. Act No.  "" lays down a procedure for the granting of trade status to the union considered to be the most representative of the activity, occupation or undertaking concerned, with a view to making possible the performance of the major functions of trade unionism, including the conclusion of collective labour agreements covering all persons involved. The system adopted is a majority system, the objectivity of which will dispose of any doubts which may arise regarding the use of discretional powers in the granting of trade status for the above-mentioned purposes. There can be no doubt that the most representative organisation is that which acts most effectively in advancing the workers' interests and it is only logical that in a system like ours, in which there may be more than one trade union for a particular branch, occupation or undertaking and under which the workers in each activity or occupation can organise as many trade unions as they like, the right to conclude collective agreements should be granted exclusively to the most representative union.""
.The Committee observes that, while Order No.  refusing trade status to the S.O.I.M.A compared, for the purpose of assessing numerical size, the number of dues paying members of the S.O.I.M.A with the number of dues-paying members of the A.O.T in the stocking industry, the Government's reply dated  September  not only uses figures for both unions which are different from those mentioned in Order No. , but appears to compare the number of dues-paying members in the S.O.I.M.A with the total membership of the A.O.T.
.On several occasions, and particularly during discussion on the draft of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, the Conference referred to the question of the representative character of trade unions, and, to a certain extent, it agreed to the distinction sometimes made between the various unions concerned according to how representative they are. Article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the I.L.O states the concept of "" most representative "" organisations.
.Thus, the mere fact that the law of a country draws a distinction between the most representative trade union organisations and other trade union organisations is not in itself a matter for criticism, provided that such distinction does not accord to the most representative organisation privileges extending beyond the privilege of priority, on the ground of its having the largest membership, in representation for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words, this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organisations not recognised as being among the most representative of the essential means whereby they may defend the occupational interests of their members, organise their administration and activities and formulate their programmes, as provided for in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina.
.The Committee has emphasised the great importance it attaches to the use of objective and predetermined criteria in deciding, under a system such as that existing in Argentina, which are the most representative trade unions, i.e. those entitled to trade status, and it recalled in another case involving Argentina, after a careful study of the law, that "" the independence of occupational organisations in relation to the public authorities might be compromised if the legislator or the executive power can effect a discrimination between the various organisations concerned which is not based on objective criteria and even more so where-as will be seen to be the case subsequently when the Argentine Act is analysed the consequences of the distinction between the different organisations are to reserve to certain organisations a monopoly both in respect of the determination of conditions of employment (collective bargaining, etc.) and in respect of the representation and defence of the interests of the workers in relation to the public authorities "".
.The Committee, in examining the case referred to in the previous paragraph, especially section  of Act No. , which states that a union possessing trade status forfeits it as soon as it ceases to be sufficiently representative and adds that "" account shall be taken of the number of its members, its trade union activity and its contribution to the defence and protection of occupational interests "", considered that the imprecise nature of the terms of this section might permit of abuse when the decision is taken by the Government whether or not to permit a particular trade union to retain its status.
.The Committee also took the view that, from the strictly trade union point of view, the functions allotted to the unions without trade status were extremely limited and recalled the definition given in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, of the term "" organisation "", i.e. "" any organisation of workers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers or of employers "".
.In view of the statutory distinction between organisations possessing trade status and ordinary trade unions, which implies that the latter are unable to defend their members' interests, the Committee considered that organisations without trade status do not have the right to organise in freedom their administration and activities and to",0,1961,Argentina
395,"formulate their programmes. "" Further, in view of the limited functions which are assigned to these organisations, it may be wondered whether the distinction does not infringe the generally recognised principle that workers shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing-a principle which is embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).""
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention once more to the fact that the privileged status accorded to organisations having trade status considerably curtails the means of action of organisations without such status and may indirectly operate against the freedom of the workers to join organisations of their own choosing, and to the desirability of reconsidering, in view of this fact, the distinction made between associations with trade status and other trade union organisations;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the importance which the Governing Body attaches to the principle that the determination of the most representative trade union should always be based on objective and pre-established criteria so that no union can accuse the Government of partiality in the matter.Geneva,  November .

396,".The Committee has already examined this case at its th Session (May ) and, with the exception of one allegation by the complainants, submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body concerning the case as a whole. These conclusions were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.At its meeting in May  the Committee further examined this case, considering the sole allegation which remained outstanding, namely the alleged refusal by the management of the National Bank to comply with certain court orders in respect of the trade union leader Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio, and made the following recommendation to the Governing Body (paragraph  of its nd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session in June )In consequence the Committee recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government specifically whether the Labour Court of Appeal, before giving its final judgment, ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until such judgment was pronounced.
.The Argentine Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.By a communication dated  July  the Government forwarded certain additional information in relation to this allegation.
.The allegation still outstanding concerns the posting by the management of the National Bank of Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio, General Secretary of the Buenos Aires Bank Employees' Union (S.E.B.B.A.), to a branch  kilometres away from Buenos Aires - this is said to be a measure of anti-union discrimination - while at the same time an administrative charge was initiated against him designed to convert this posting into an outright dismissal.
.The LF.C.T.U stated that the S.E.B.B.A then applied to the judge for an injunction to prevent any modification in Mr. Robacio's position until judgment had been given in a lawsuit brought by the union. Although the judge granted this injunction, the Bank refused to comply with it, despite a further sentence by the same judge against the Chairman of the Bank for contempt of court. The Bank authorities having appealed against the labour judge's decision, the Labour Court of Appeal on  April  affirmed the interlocutory injunction granted by the judge. The National Bank refused to comply with this order also. These statements of the I.F.C.T.U have been supported by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Supervisors and Commercial Travellers.
.Having noted that the Government in its reply had refrained from making any comment on this point, the Committee took the view at its th Session (May ) that it would be advisable to adjourn examination of this particular aspect of the case pending receipt of information from the Government, and it made a recommendation to the Governing Body to this effect.
.The Committee's conclusions as adopted by the Governing Body, and in particular the request for information on the matters mentioned above, were brought to the notice of the Government by a letter from the Director-General dated  July .
.The Government replied by a communication dated  September . This reply, however, still contained no information on the points referred to above.
.In these circumstances the Committee at its th Session (November ) recommended the Governing Body to request the Government once again to furnish information in respect of the allegations to the effect that the management of the National Bank had not complied with the injunction granted by the labour judge, and subsequently affirmed by the Labour Court of Appeal, relating to the situation of the General Secretary of the S.E.B.B.A.
.In a communication dated  November  the Government forwarded further information concerning the allegation.
.In its communication dated  November  the Government stated that Mr. Ral Ignacio Robacio's posting was a normal one for which provision was made in the statutory regulations governing public employees, and that in any case Mr. Robacio had not accepted his posting and had refused to take up the new duties assigned to him. The Government added that Mr. Robacio had then lodged an appeal for protection with the sitting labour judge, who ordered the Bank not to proceed with the posting, but the Bank had refused to acknowledge the competence of the labour court and lodged an appeal to have the decision quashed. The Labour Court of Appeal-continued the Government-had affirmed the decision in that the court was competent to hear the case, but quashed the judge's decision in favour of protection. The Government concluded by stating that Mr. Robacio had open to him all legal avenues for establishing his rights, "" which proved the existence of effective legal guarantees such as characterise a system of justice "".
.The Committee observed at its th (February ) Session that the complainants' statements and those of the Government were not in themselves contradictory with each other. The Committee also observed, however, that while the Government confirmed the complainants' statement to the effect that when Mr. Robacio had appealed to the labour judge for protection the latter had ordered the Bank not to proceed, and that later the Labour Court of Appeal had affirmed the decision as to the competence of the court to hear the case, it made no reference to the contempt of court, alleged by the complainants to have been committed by the National Bank in declining to accept the rulings of the labour judge and of the Labour Court of Appeal that it should not go forward with Mr. Robacio's posting.
.In these circumstances the Committee considered that it was essential, if it was to reach a decision on this aspect of the case, for it to know whether it was correct-as the complainants alleged-that the National Bank had on a number of occasions flouted the decisions of the judicial authorities and, if so, what measures had been taken by the Government in this respect.
.Furthermore, the Committee felt that it would be difficult for it to take a decision without knowing the exact circumstances surrounding this particular allegation, and to this end it would be advisable, in accordance with its usual practice, to request the Government to forward copies of the judgments, together with all the conclusions of law and findings of fact given in this connection by the judge of first instance and the Labour Court of Appeal, instead of a summary of the dispositive part of these judgments such as the Government had given in its communication of  November .
.In its communication of  April  the Government repeats what it stated in its communication of  November  and adds that "" it should be borne in mind that under Argentine law the lodging of an appeal in protection cases has a suspensive effect, whereby in virtue of the appeal by the President of the Argentine National Bank against the ruling of the judge of first instance the proceedings remained in a state of suspense until the Labour Court of Appeal pronounced its final judgment quashing the decision of the judge of first instance in favour of protection "". The Government adds that this procedural formula does not imply, "" as the complainants mistakenly claim, a refusal to bow to the authority of the judge of first instance "".
.The Committee observed at its preceding session (May ) that in its communication of  April the Government had affirmed that under Argentine law the lodging of an appeal in protection cases has a suspensive effect, and that in consequence there was a stay of execution of the ruling of the judge of first instance in the case in question until the Labour Court of Appeal pronounced its final judgment. The Committee also observed, however, that the complainants had alleged that the injunction not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting was granted in the first place by the judge of first instance and subsequently ( April ) affirmed by the Labour Court of Appeal. Noting that the Government, in its various communications, had never expressly denied that the Labour Court of Appeal-as alleged by the complainants-ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until final judgment was pronounced, the Committee felt that if it was to come to a decision in full awareness of the facts on this aspect of the complaint it would be helpful to have this point cleared up by the Argentine Government. Accordingly, it recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government specifically whether the Labour Court of Appeal, before giving its final judgment, ordered the Bank not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting until such judgment was pronounced.
.In its reply of  July  the Government states that at no stage did the Labour Court of Appeal issue an order not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting. Furthermore the Government repeats a number of minor points figuring in its previous statements, to the effect that the complainants confuse the machinery of appeal with suspensive effect and an alleged refusal to comply, which never occurred.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that the",-1,1960,Argentina
397,"Labour Court of Appeal at no time issued an order not to proceed with Mr. Robacio's posting; it would appear to follow from this answer that the National Bank did not refuse to comply with any decision by the Labour Court of Appeal, since the said Court did not issue an order "" not to proceed "" but did issue a decision by which-because it considered the application for protection to have been unfounded-it quashed the decision of the labour judge. It would seem, moreover, that Mr. Robacio had open to him all legal means of establishing his rights and that accordingly there is no further object in proceeding with this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the outstanding allegation relating to refusal by the National Bank to comply with certain court orders does not call for further examination.

.The Committee already considered this case at its th Session (May ) and, except for one allegation by the complainants, it submitted its final conclusions regarding the whole case to the Governing Body. These conclusions were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.This is not the first time that the Committee has had to examine the consequences of the distinction made in Argentine legislation between organisations with trade union status and others. Nor is it the first time that the Argentine Government has disputed the validity of conclusions reached by the Committee and the Governing Body in this connection. It would, therefore, seem essential to state the exact position of the Committee and the Governing Body in regard to this matter.
.The Government's comments would seem to indicate that it believes the Committee's and the Governing Body's remarks to relate essentially to the fact that certain particular privileges are granted only to the most representative organisations. This was not in fact the position adopted either by the Committee or by the Governing Body.
.On several occasions, and particularly during discussion on the draft of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Conference referred to the question of the representative character of trade unions, and, to a certain extent, it agreed to the distinction sometimes made between the various unions concerned according to how representative they are. Article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the I.L.O states the concept of "" most representative "" organisations.
.Thus, the mere fact that the law of a country draws a distinction between the most representative trade union organisations and other trade union organisations is not in itself a matter for criticism, provided that such distinction does not accord to the most representative organisation privileges extending beyond the privilege of priority, on the ground of its having the largest membership, in representation for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words, this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organisations not recognised as being among the most representative of the essential means whereby they may defend the occupational interests of their members, organise their administration and activities and formulate their programmes, as provided for in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina.
.In this respect",-1,1960,Argentina
399,"the Government's reply to the Committee's and the Governing Body's conclusions concerning the section of the Committee's report quoted in paragraph  above states that the fact that an association does not enjoy trade union status does not prevent it apart from the right to participate in collective bargaining-from fulfilling its functions of defending the workers' occupational interests and pursuing its economic, cultural and sporting and other activities perfectly normally. In the Government's opinion, Act No.  does not confer any "" privileged status "" on associations having trade union status nor is it correct that it "" limits considerably the field of action of organisations which do not have this status ""; similarly, it is stated that it would be wrong to suggest that the system of law in Argentina "" can indirectly affect the right of workers to join the organisations of their own choosing "".
.At this stage reference should be made to the text of the Act itself. The consequences of the distinction drawn between organisations which respectively have or have not trade union personality would appear to be determined in sections  and , defining the functions and rights of these two classes of organisations. Section  provides that the rights and functions listed shall be enjoyed exclusively by organisations having trade union status. The rights thus granted under section  only to organisations having such status include: participation in the work of the public bodies concerned with the regulation of labour and social security; collective bargaining and concluding collective agreements; collaborating with the State in a technical and advisory capacity in the study and solution of problems of concern to the occupation that they represent; holding meetings without obtaining prior permission; defending and representing the individual interests of members vis--vis the social security institutions, courts of law and other public bodies; and the defence and representation of the occupational interests of employees vis--vis the State and the employers. Although the last of the above-mentioned rights is also granted to ordinary organisations, section  states that such organisations shall enjoy these rights only provided that there is no organisation with trade union status for the particular occupational category.
.Among the activities in which ordinary organisations may engage, section  mentions the establishment of provident institutions, holiday camps, canteens, hospitals and the like, the formation of co-operatives of producers and consumers, the promotion of general and vocational education by means of libraries, schools and so on.
.It cannot be disputed that the functions which organisations not having trade union status are allowed to fulfil in the field of trade union activities are exceedingly limited. Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, defines the term "" occupational organisation "" as meaning "" any organisation of workers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers or of employers "". Examination of the Act would appear to indicate that ordinary organisations do not enjoy the means to achieve this end and that their scope of action is greatly restricted.
.The Committee and the Governing Body already arrived at the same conclusions when they examined Case No. , also concerning Argentina. In that instance, considering the limited functions open to ordinary organisations, the Committee felt that the distinction made in national legislation could have the indirect consequence of restricting the freedom of the workers to belong to the organisations of their own choosing.
.The reasons which led the Committee and the Governing Body to adopt this position are as follows. As a general rule, when a government can grant an advantage to one particular organisation or withdraw that advantage from one organisation in favour of another, there is a risk, even if such is not the government's intention, that one trade union will enjoy an unfair advantage or disadvantage in relation to the others, which thereby constitutes an act of discrimination. More precisely, by placing one organisation at an advantage or at a disadvantage in relation to the others, a government may either directly or indirectly influence the choice of workers regarding the organisation to which they intend to belong, since they will undeniably want to belong to the union best able to serve them, even if their natural preference would have led them to join another organisation for occupational, religious, political or other reasons. Thus, the freedom to choose is a right expressly laid down in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which Argentina has ratified.
.The Committee considers that the latest observations submitted by the Government do not add any new elements, with regard to the question as a whole, to the arguments which it presented earlier, and that, consequently, the Committee has no reason to modify its previous conclusions, as stated in paragraph  of its th Report, which, as stated above, were approved by the Governing Body.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government once again, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  to  above, to furnish its observations at an early date in respect of the allegations to the effect that the management of the National Bank did not comply with the injunctions granted by the labour judge and subsequently affirmed by the court of appeal relating to the situation of the General Secretary of the Buenos Aires Bank Employees' Union;(b) to confirm, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  to  above, the conclusions contained in paragraph  (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Committee's th Report, which are cited in paragraph  above;(c) to take note of the present interim report regarding the allegations still outstanding, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the information requested in subparagraph (a) above.
.The complaint of the I.F.C.T.U is contained in a communication dated  April , which was followed up by two further communications dated  May and  June . By a communication dated  June  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Supervisors and Commercial Travellers informed the Director-General of their desire to support the complaint of the I.F.C.T.U. The Government submitted its observations on the various communications of the I.F.C.T.U in a letter dated  February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  December  the Buenos Aires Bank Employees' Union (S.E.B.B.A) requested the Minister of Labour to grant it the status of an incorporated trade union ("" trade union personality ""); on the basis of a provision in Act No. , the Minister rejected this request, on the grounds that the union had not been in existence for six months at the date of the application. Representations by the I.F.C.T.U requesting the Government to review its decision remained unanswered.
.In the meantime, on  January , a dispute broke out at the National Bank as a consequence of the dispatch by the head office of a confidential circular (the text of which has been supplied by the complainants) forbidding employees to engage in any trade union activity, and a subsequent interview with the trade union officials of the Boedo branch to notify them of this order and announce possible disciplinary penalties.
.Representatives of the S.E.B.B.A thereupon presented themselves on  February at the Directorate-General of Labour Relations, the competent authority, with the request that a conciliation meeting be convened. This authority, it is alleged, after having verbally stated that it could not reply favourably to this request on account of the fact that the S.E.B.B.A did not possess "" trade union personality "", allowed the normal waiting period to elapse without taking any action. An appeal to the Minister of Labour also remained without effect.
.On  March  the S.E.B.B.A brought a lawsuit against the National Bank and the Minister of Labour for violation of the new article  of the National Constitution concerning the right of workers to organise freely and democratically in trade unions and asked the Government to act in accordance with Act No. , which ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). On  April  the labour judge, after verifying the facts alleged at the National Bank, sent letters to the Chairman of the Bank and to the Minister of Labour to inquire into the reasons for these infringements of trade union freedom. Three hours after the judge's visit to the National Bank, the Bank authorities are said to have decided to post the General Secretary of the S.E.B.B.A local, Mr. Ral Ignacio Robaccio, to a branch situated  kilometres away from Buenos Aires, and at the same time initiated an administrative charge against him designed to convert this posting into an outright dismissal.
.The S.E.B.B.A",4,1960,Argentina
400,"then applied to the judge for an injunction to prevent any modification in the situation until judgment had been given. Although the judge granted this injunction, the complainants allege that the Bank refused to comply with it, despite a further sentence by the same judge against the Chairman of the Bank for refusal and contempt of court. The authorities of the National Bank having appealed against the labour judge's decision, the court of appeal on  April  affirmed the interlocutory injunction granted by the judge. The National Bank is said to have likewise declined to comply with this decree.
.In its reply the Government states that the S.E.B.B.A is registered with the General Directorate of Occupational Associations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security as a first-degree organisation. This registration was granted on application in accordance with the legislation in force, in view of the fact that the organisation in question complied with the requirements of section  of the Occupational Associations Act (No. ).
.Subsequently the S.E.B.B.A applied for recognition as a trade union; this request could not be complied with because the union did not fulfil the requirement laid down in section  () of Act No. , viz. a union must have been in operation for more than six months.
.The Government adds that section  () of Act No.  states that "" occupational associations on registration in accordance with section  of the present Act shall be entitled to defend and represent the interests of the occupation concerned in dealings with the State and with employers whenever there is no organisation in the same occupation which has been recognised as the most representative body "". In banking, declares the Government, there already exists an organisation which enjoys such a status, to wit the Association of Bank Employees.
.In another case relating to Argentina (the Government now refers, incidentally, to the observations it made at that time) the Committee examined in great detail the numerous consequences of distinctions made under the Act in question between organisations with trade union status and those which did not have it.
.After a thorough study of the Act the Committee at that time expressed the opinion that the independence of occupational organisations in relation to the public authorities might be compromised if the legislator or the executive power could effect a discrimination between the various organisations concerned which was not based on objective criteria, and even more so where the consequences of the distinction between the different organisations were to reserve to certain organisations a monopoly both in respect of the determination of conditions of employment (collective bargaining, etc.) and in respect of the representation and defence of the interests of the workers in relation to the public authorities.
.The Committee also observed that from the strictly trade union point of view the role assigned to organisations which did not enjoy trade union status was extremely limited, and it recalled in this connection the definition contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. )-since ratified by Argentina-to the effect that the term "" organisation "" means "" any organisation of workers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers or of employers "".
.In view of the fact that the distinction made by the Act between organisations enjoying trade union status and ordinary organisations resulted in the latter's being unable to defend occupational interests and conclude collective agreements, the Committee concluded that organisations which did not have trade union status did not have the right to organise in freedom their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. "" Further,"" declared the Committee, "" in view of the limited functions which are assigned to these organisations, it may be wondered whether the distinction does not infringe the generally recognised principle that workers shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing-a principle which is embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).""
.In view of the fact that the situation does not appear to have changed since the conclusions referred to above were reached, and that Argentina has in the meantime ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Committee recommends the Governing Body once again to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the privileged position accorded to associations enjoying trade union status limits considerably the field of action of organisations which do not have this status, and may indirectly operate against the freedom of workers to belong to organisations of their own choosing, and to the desirability of considering the possibility of abolishing the distinction made under the Act between associations with trade union status and other occupational organisations.
.As regards the allegation to the effect that the management of the National Bank has taken steps to prevent its employees from engaging in any form of trade union activity (see paragraph  above) the Government recalls first of all that the employees of the National Bank, the official bank of Argentina, have the status of public servants. It adds that the measure taken by the management of the Bank was in accordance with Ministerial Order No. / dated  March , which was itself adopted to deal with an exceptional situation which threatened to disrupt banking operations, which are of vital importance and a stoppage in which could paralyse the country's economic life.
.In these circumstances, declares the Government, there could be no question of allowing the employees of the National Bank, as public servants, under the pretext that they were taking part in their trade union activities during the hours when the Bank was open to the public, to bring the whole of the Government's banking activities to a halt with resulting disruption of the national economy. "" Accordingly,"" concludes the Government, "" it was essential to insist that all trade union activities should take place outside bank opening hours in order not to obstruct the essential operations of the state banking system.""
.The Ministerial Order referred to in paragraph  above, the text of which is supplied by the Government, is couched in the following terms on the subject: "" Employees' delegates, members of internal committees or workers with similar representative functions, while entitled to perform their union duties, should do so in a manner compatible with the effective carrying out of their obligations as employees; this is so because they have the status of active employees; for this reason any attitude designed to prevent or hinder in any way the proper and efficient giving of their services by disrupting the normal course of activities in banking and insurance establishments is out of place; ... in the branch of activity in question, in view of the peculiarities thereof, employees' delegates, members of internal committees or workers with similar functions of a trade union nature should carry on their trade union activities outside working hours.""
.The explanations given by the Government and the texts that it has submitted in support of the same reveal that, contrary to the assertions of the complainants, the measures taken by the management of the National Bank do not prohibit employees absolutely from engaging in any form of trade union activity, but simply limit such activity to the time outside working hours.
.It appears that such limitation cannot be considered as an infringement of the exercise of trade union rights, since Article  () (b) of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), states unequivocally that employers, while they may agree to trade union activities being carried on during working hours, are not obliged to do so. The Convention puts it in this way: there should not be prejudice against a worker because of "" participation in union activities outside working hours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours "".
.In these conditions the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this particular aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.Answering the complainants' allegations concerning the transfer of the General Secretary of their organisation, which according to them constituted an anti-union discriminatory measure, the Government affirms that on the contrary it was a normal posting which took place under civil service regulations.
.While bearing in mind that the evidence available is not sufficient to enable it to determine the real reasons behind the transfer in question, the Committee considers that, since this posting was decided upon at a time when a dispute was in progress between the employers and the organisation of which the person in question was General Secretary, the complainants had some cause for supposing that there was a connection between the posting and the trade union position occupied by this man.
.In these circumstances, while considering that the contradictory information before it in this instance does not allow it",2,1960,Argentina
401,"to determine whether further examination by the Governing Body would serve any useful purpose, the Committee wishes to emphasise, as it has done on several previous occasions, that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment-dismissal, transfer or other prejudicial measures -and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee also wishes to point out that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure respect for the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely.
.In consequence the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principles mentioned above, which are embodied in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), both ratified by Argentina.
.There remains one point put forward by the complainants concerning which the Government has refrained from submitting observations: the allegations that two injunctions granted in a court of first instance and confirmed by the court of appeal instructing the management of the Bank not to modify the situation with regard to the General Secretary of the complaining organisation were ignored by the said management.
.The Committee has adjourned its examination of this particular aspect of the case pending receipt of the Government's observations thereon, and recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to submit these observations.
.As regards the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above, that the allegations concerning the prohibition of National Bank employees from engaging in trade union activities do not call for further examination;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the privileged position accorded to associations enjoying trade union status limits considerably the field of action of organisations which do not have this status, and may indirectly operate against the freedom of workers to belong to organisations of their own choosing, and to the desirability of considering the possibility of abolishing the distinction made under the Act between associations with trade union status and other occupational organisations;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance attached by the Governing Body to the principle whereby workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment-dismissal, transfer or other prejudicial measures-and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure respect for the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely;(e) to request the Government to submit its observations in respect of the allegations to the effect that the management of the National Bank did not comply with the injunctions granted by the labour judge and subsequently affirmed by the court of appeal relating to the situation of the General Secretary of the complaining organisation;(f) to take note of the present interim report in respect of this last allegation, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon as soon as it is in possession of the information requested from the Government in accordance with subparagraph (e) above.",4,1960,Argentina
402,".In a letter dated  January , supplemented by another dated  February , the P.T.T.I placed before the I.L.O a complaint to the effect that the exercise of trade union rights had been infringed in the Argentine Republic. This complaint was communicated to the Government by letter dated  March .
.At the th Session (May ) of the Committee, as the Government had not yet sent any observations, it was decided to defer examination of the case until the next session. The Government was informed of this decision by letter dated  May .
.At the th Session (November ) the Government's reply, dated  October , was placed before the Committee. However, the reply having arrived too late for the Committee to be able to study it in a satisfactory manner, it was decided that the case as a whole should be deferred until the following session.
.At the th Session (February ) the Committee took note of a letter from the Government, dated  February , announcing that supplementary observations on this case were being sent. It therefore decided to defer examination until these observations should be in its hands.
.The Government transmitted the said observations in a letter dated  June .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that, in connection with a dispute between the postal workers and the Argentine authorities, the latter took certain action incompatible with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). The particular allegations made by the complainants are discussed below. It may first be advisable to review the various stages of the dispute as described by the complainants, their version being in general in conformity with that given in the Government's reply (the additional information contained therein is inserted at the appropriate points).
.There was inflation in Argentina in , which hit the working class very hard. In June  the Federation of Postal and Telecommunications Workers (FOECYT), which has , members, started negotiations with the Government for a pay increase on the ground that the cost-of-living index had risen during the past year by approximately  per cent without any increase in the wages and salaries of communications workers.
.The offer made by the Government (an increase of  per cent.) was considered insufficient by the FOECYT, all the more so as it was coupled with a four-hour extension of the working week. As a protest, and in order to exercise pressure on the authorities, the Federation arranged a "" slow down "", then instructed its members to "" work to rule "" and, finally, called a strike on  December .
.The Government states in its observations that the members of the FOECYT are public service personnel whose right to strike is subject to certain restrictions; that by its attitude, and particularly by calling for a stoppage, the FOECYT acted contrary to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, No. ; and that the strike was therefore considered unlawful.
.On  January  the Minister issued a warning that disciplinary action would be taken if work did not return to normal within  hours. "" As the postal and telegraph workers "" (to quote the complainants' own words) "" took no notice of the Government's intervention "", repressive action was taken against a number of strikers.
.After an appeal ( January ) by members of the Senate, who offered their mediation on condition that the strike should end, work was resumed ( January ), and - still according to the complainants - the repressive action ceased (- January ).
.In its reply of  October  the Government states that the dispute was settled, an agreement satisfactory to the parties having, apparently, been reached with the only two associations of personnel which had official recognition as trade unions (personeria gremial), namely the Association of Telegraphists, Radio-Telegraphists and Similar Personnel and the National Civil Servants' Union, Branch  (the FOECYT did not have this recognition). The Government adds at the close of its memorandum that, although it was not a "" recognised "" union, the public authorities had sought as far as possible to meet the FOECYT's demands. This seems to be confirmed by the lengthy negotiations which took place.
.The course of events having been thus summarised it will now be appropriate to examine the particular allegations made by the P.T.T.I to the effect that the Argentine authorities committed grave infringements of freedom of association. These allegations are dealt with separately below.Allegations concerning the Arrest of Workers
.The P.T.T.I alleges, using rather vague terms, that an "" unknown number "" of postal and telegraph workers were imprisoned "" as trade unionists "". In its reply the Government states that no postal or telegraph workers were arrested "" by reason of their quality as trade unionists "". The Government does not deny that there were arrests; however, it declares that these were due exclusively to acts of violence or infringements of freedom to work and that in any case they were carried out "" in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations "".
.In previous cases in which the Committee has had to examine allegations concerning the arrest of trade union officers or members it has considered that the only question arising is the real ground for the arrests. Only if these were ordered because of trade union affiliation or activity properly so called could an infringement of freedom of association be held to have occurred.""
.In the present case, having regard on the one hand to the vagueness of the allegations and on the other hand to the Government's categorical statement that the arrests of certain trade unionists were due to acts of violence and the like, but not to the trade union status or activities of the persons concerned (indeed, the complaints do not even allege that they were due to participation in the strike), and having regard also to the statement of the complainants themselves that all the persons arrested have been released, the Committee, while reaffirming the importance that it attaches to the principle that public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict trade union rights or impede the lawful exercise thereof, recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing further the examination of this aspect of the case.Allegations concerning Dismissal of Strikers
.Without giving details, the complainants allege that an "" unknown number of postal and telegraph workers "" were dismissed. In its reply the Government states that no personnel was dismissed owing to the dispute; that the whole staff was reintegrated; and that the nine persons discontinued were temporary employees whose contracts had expired. The Government adds that it went so far as to re-engage a temporary worker, despite her misconduct in the service, because of special intervention by the union.
.Whereas the Government in its reply states categorically that there were no dismissals due to the dispute and that those members of the staff who appear to have been temporarily suspended were all reintegrated, the complainants make their allegation in the vaguest terms and adduce no single name or other specification in its support.
.In these circumstances the Committee considers that the complainants have not furnished proof that there was an infringement of freedom of association in this instance, and therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations concerning Withholding of Wage Payments and Disciplinary Action
.The complainants allege in very general terms that some arrested or dismissed workers had received no pay since  January . They also state that disciplinary measures were taken against FOECYT trade unionists, but that they do not know to what extent.
.In its observations on this aspect of the case the Government declares that no employee failed to receive the normal pay of his grade and that no disciplinary action was taken. "" The fact "" it adds "" that the strikers were not paid for the days on which they did not work was strictly in conformity with Decree No.  of  November , a statutory measure which must be respected "".
.The Government goes on to state that the suspensions "" which certain employees attributed to their part in the strike "" were imposed in due application of section  of the Staff Regulations for the National Civil Service (Legislative Decree No. /) because of excessive unjustified absence. The Government adds that, in the calculation of absences in this connection, days on which employees were on strike were not included.
.In reply to the complainants' allegations, which - as shown above - are put in rather vague terms and give no exact data (names of persons against whom disciplinary action was taken, character of the action, etc.), the Government gives a specific explanation of the character of the action taken and the reasons for it: this does not seem to indicate",0,1960,Argentina
403,"that there was an infringement of freedom of association here.
.In the circumstances the Committee considers that the complainants have not furnished proof that there was in this instance an infringement of freedom of association, and therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations relating to Measures Taken against Mr. Bucci, General Secretary of the FOECYT and Other Officers of the Federation
.The complainants state that the "" trade union leave "" (licencia gremial) granted to Mr. Bucci, General Secretary, and other officers of the FOECYT had been withdrawn by the authorities, who are alleged to have replied that such leave had never been granted to Mr. Bucci. The complainants describe this last assertion as false and adduce in support of their view the text of a passage from the Bulletin of the Department of Communications (No.  of  November ) which does indeed indicate that trade union leave was granted in Mr. Bucci's case,
.In its reply the Government confirms that trade union leave was given to officers of the FOECYT, but only "" as a contribution to constructive trade union activity "". It adds that this action was taken outside the relevant statutory rules, since the FOECYT "" had not and has not "" official recognition as a trade union; that grant of the said leave was thus a favour which the authorities were not obliged to concede; that the FOECYT had outlawed itself by calling the strike without fulfilling the statutory conditions and in disregard of the particular character of the work of postal and telephone personnel who perform a public service; and that it would not have been logical, in the open conflict which had arisen, for the Department to continue to grant it the privilege in question.
.At this point the term "" trade union leave "" (licencia gremial) should be explained. In Argentina it evidently means the authorisation given to an employee to engage in full-time trade union work while continuing to receive his wage or salary. In its supplementary observations of  June  the Government quotes the text of a decree on the subject. This states that, if an employee of the Government is appointed to a trade union office "" for which no payment is made by the trade union organisation, he shall be entitled to leave with pay to the extent necessary for the duration of his term..."". Moreover, it appears from the Government's explanations that in the case of officially recognised trade unions this leave is given more or less automatically, but that the same does not apply to unions which have not been so recognised.
.In the supplementary observations made in its letter of  June  the Government provides further information in this regard. It refers to a system introduced under Argentine legislation "" for granting to a trade union organisation the right to be judged most representative of the relevant trade or occupation "". This, it says, permits performance of some of the most important functions of a trade union, particularly the conclusion of collective agreements, which may then be rendered applicable erga omnes. The system, the Government continues, being "" that of numerical determination, is so objective as to dissipate any possible suspicion of partiality in the grant of recognition for the abovementioned purposes. Indubitably, the most representative organisation is that which does the biggest and most important job in defence of the workers' interests. Moreover, it is logical that in a system of trade union pluralism such as ours, where as many unions can be set up in a given trade or occupation as the workers desire, the right to trade union leave should be limited to the most representative.""
.On several occasions, and particularly during discussion on the draft of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, the Conference referred to the question of the representative character of trade unions, and, to a certain extent, it agreed to the distinction sometimes made between the various unions concerned according to how representative they are. Article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the I.L.O states the concept of "" most representative "" organisations.
.Thus, the mere fact that the law of a country draws a distinction between the most representative trade union organisations and other trade union organisations is not in itself a matter for criticism, provided that such distinction does not accord to the most representative organisation privileges extending beyond the privilege, on the ground of its having the largest membership, of priority in representation for such purposes as collective bargaining or consultation by governments or for the purpose of nominating delegates to international bodies. In other words, this distinction should not have the effect of depriving trade union organisations not recognised as being among the most representative of the essential means whereby they may defend the occupational interests of their members, organise their administration and activities and formulate their programmes, as provided for in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina.
.It will be seen from the comments of the Government that the privilege of receiving licences is not exclusively reserved to the most representative trade unions, that is to say the ones which enjoy official recognition. It appears-since this privilege had also been extended to the FOECYT, the union involved in this case-that trade union licences can be, and occasionally are, granted to organisations other than those recognised as representative.
.It is therefore desirable that trade union licences should be granted in accordance with objective criteria and not simply at the discretion of the authorities. The Committee considers that, generally speaking, a system under which a government can grant a privilege to a particular organisation, or withdraw that privilege from an organisation to confer it on another one-to mention only two examples-might result in one union receiving particularly favourable or unfavourable treatment by comparison with the others and might thereby give rise to discrimination. More specifically, a government, by treating a particular organisation more favourably or more unfavourably than others, might influence the workers in their choice of the organisation to which they wish to belong. Now, in this field freedom of choice for the persons concerned is a right specifically laid down in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). If, therefore, a government wishes to grant certain privileges to trade unions, it is essential that in granting them it should treat all the unions concerned on an equal footing. The Committee had occasion to lay down this principle in an earlier case relating to privileges granted to certain organisations in the form of the provision of premises.
.In the present case, however, the withdrawal of the trade union licences of Mr. Bucci and other members of the FOECYT does not seem to have been a discriminatory measure. The licences in question were granted as a favour, the authorities not being required to grant them. By calling a strike without taking into account the restrictions of the right of employees of state public services to strike, and, in particular, by ignoring the provisions of Act No.  concerning conciliation and arbitration, the organisation in question placed itself in the wrong; this would appear to justify the withdrawal by the authorities of a privilege which they had voluntarily granted to the union and to which the latter had no specific right.
.In the circumstances, subject to the general remarks in paragraph  above, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the complaint does not call for further consideration.
.The complainants further allege that, in a letter from the "" Chief of Administration"", dated  January , Mr. Bucci, General Secretary of the FOECYT, was informed that, his "" licence "" (trade union leave) having been withdrawn, he had been transferred to Branch Office La Plata  and was invited to explain his reasons for absence from service.
.The complainants state in this regard that, two years before, Mr. Bucci had been, elected by the postal and telecommunication workers of Argentina, in a secret ballot, as a member of the Disciplinary Committee of the Department. This body, they continue, meets once a week and "" staff members are released from work in the service and are fulltime members of the Committee "". They conclude that the Department "" was therefore in the wrong to recall Mr. Bucci into the service and to apply disciplinary measures when he refused to obey "".
.In its reply the Government states that membership of the Disciplinary Committee does not carry with it release from the obligation to attend for duty on the days when the Committee has no sitting; that after the strike, and apparently also after transmission of the complaint, some of the staff members were excused other duty by decision of the Department of Communications; that, by virtue of this decision, Mr. Bucci is able to perform",2,1960,Argentina
404,"his trade union functions while receiving his salary as a civil servant; that the only requirement made of Mr. Bucci is to serve as a member of the said Committee, and that, despite his absence from sittings, no disciplinary action has been taken against him.
.It proceeds from the Government's explanation that Mr. Bucci has had the benefit of a general measure which enables him to spend his whole time on trade union business while continuing to receive his salary. Mr. Bucci's position seems thus to have reverted to what it was before his trade union leave was withdrawn. Furthermore, he appears to have retained his membership of the Disciplinary Committee.
.In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the complaint has become purposeless and therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that it does not call for further examination.
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that, for the reasons given in paragraphs  to  above and subject to the observations contained in paragraphs  and , the complaint made by the P.T.T.I does not call for further examination.",2,1960,Argentina
405,".In a communication dated  December  the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers (Trade Department of the W.F.T.U) submitted to the I.L.O a complaint against the Argentine Government alleging infringement of trade union rights. In a communication dated  February  the W.F.T.U stated that it endorsed this complaint.
.In two communications dated  March  the complaint was forwarded to the Government for its observations, and the W.F.T.U was informed of its right to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month. The Government replied by a letter dated  September .
.Dealing with the case at its th Session (November ), the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), containing a request for certain additional information.""
.The Argentine Government was informed by a letter from the Director-General dated  November  of the Committee's interim conclusions, as approved by the Governing Body, and sent its reply to the Office in a communication dated  February , which arrived too late for examination at the th Session of the Committee in February .
.Dealing with the case again at its th Session (May ), the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report containing its final recommendations on certain allegations relating to the arrest of Mr. Andrs Framini, General Secretary of the Argentine Association of Textile Workers, leaving outstanding only the allegations relating to the strike of textile workers and to measures taken against the strikers. This report by the Committee was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.The case was again considered by the Committee at its th Session (November ), when the Committee had before it a communication from the Government dated  October , providing additional information. After noting this information, the Committee felt that it would be advisable to wait for the fuller information which the Government appeared to intend to supply before making any recommendations on this aspect of the case to the Governing Bo y. The recommendation of the Committee, contained in paragraph  of its th Report, was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.In a communication dated  April  the Government supplied information concerning the outstanding allegations, namely in connection with the strike of textile workers and measures taken against the strikers. The following paragraphs deal exclusively with those allegations.
.The Argentine Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the matters raised in the allegations relating to the strike of textile workers and to measures taken against the strikers are already covered by the recommendations contained in paragraph  (b) of this report in respect of Case No. , also before the Committee at this session.
.In a letter dated  December  the Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers' Trade Unions International (a trade secretariat of the W.F.T.U.) lodged a complaint with the I.L.O against the Argentine Government concerning a breach of freedom of association. The W.F.T.U in a letter dated  February  stated that it wished to submit this complaint on its own behalf.
.In two letters dated  March  the complaint was forwarded to the Government for its observations and the W.F.T.U was informed of its right to submit further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month. The Government replied by a letter dated  September .
.When the case came before the Committee at its th Session (November ), the Committee submitted an interim report to the Governing Body, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ); this report contained a number of requests to the Government for additional information.
.The Argentine Government was informed of the Committee's interim conclusions, as approved by the Governing Body, in a letter from the Director-General dated  November  and made its reply to the Office in a letter dated  February , which arrived too late for it to be examined by the Committee at its th Session (February ).
.When the case again came before it at its th Session (May ), the Committee made an interim report to the Governing Body containing its final recommendations on certain allegations relating to the arrest of Mr. Andrs Framini, General Secretary of the Argentine Association of Textile Workers, leaving outstanding only the allegations relating to the strike of textile workers and to measures taken against the strikers. This report by the Committee was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ). The following paragraphs deal only with the allegations still outstanding.
.While thanking the Government for the information it has been kind enough to supply on this aspect of the complaint, the Committee feels that it would be advisable to wait for the fuller information which the Government appears to intend to supply before making any recommendations on this aspect of the case to the Governing Body.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the present interim report.
.In a communication dated  December  the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers (Trade Department of the W.F.T.U.) submitted to the I.L.O a complaint against the Government of Argentina for infringement of trade union rights. The complaining organisation had its complaint endorsed by the W.F.T.U, which submitted the complaint to the I.L.O on its own account by a letter dated  February .

.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Andrs Framini, General Secretary of the Argentine Textile Workers' Federation:(i) to express the hope that in its relations with employers' and workers' organisations and their representatives the Government will as far as possible rely on measures laid down by ordinary law rather than on emergency measures which by their very nature are liable to involve certain restrictions on fundamental rights;(ii) to draw the Government's attention once more to the importance it has always attached to the principle that in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are accused of political or criminal offences which the government considers to lie outside the scope of their trade union activities, they should be judged promptly by an impartial and independent judicial authority;(iii) to decide, since Mr. Framini is now at liberty once more, that, subject to the observations made in subparagraphs (i) and () above, this aspect does not call for further examination;(b) to take note of the present interim report with respect to the allegations relating to the strike of textile workers and action taken against the strikers, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the further information announced in this connection by the Government.
.In a communication, dated  December , the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers (Trade Department of the W.F.T.U.) submitted to the I.L.O a complaint against the Government of Argentina for infringement of trade union rights. The complaining organisation had the complaint endorsed by the W.F.T.U, which submitted a like complaint to the I.L.O by letter dated  February .
.The complaint was forwarded to the Government for its observations in a letter dated  March , and the W.F.T.U was informed by letter of even date of its right to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month.
.The Government replied by a letter dated  September .Receivability of the Complaint
.In accordance with the procedure now in force for the examination of complaints of alleged infringements of trade union rights, allegations are receivable only if they are submitted by a national organisation directly interested in",-1,1959,Argentina
406,"the matter, an international organisation of employers or workers having consultative status with the I.L.O, or another international organisation of employers or workers where the allegations relate to matters directly affecting its affiliated organisations. In the present case, the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the original complainant, is an international organisation which has no consultative status with the I.L.O, nor is there any evidence to indicate that the Argentine organisation to which reference is made in the allegations is affiliated to it. However, it would not appear necessary to pursue this aspect of the case in view of the fact that the complaint has been formally endorsed by the W.F.T.U. Under these circumstances the Committee considers that the complaint is receivable under the procedure in force.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, in relation to the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Framini, General Secretary of the Argentine Textile Workers' Association:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the importance which the Governing Body has always attached to the principle that, when trade unionists are accused of political or criminal offences which a government considers to be outside the scope of their trade union activities, they should be judged promptly by an impartial and independent judicial authority;(ii) to request the Government, having regard to the principle set forth above, to inform the Governing Body whether Mr. Framini is now in prison or at liberty on bail and also to inform the Governing Body as to the legal or judicial proceedings taken in his case and the result of such proceedings;(b) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee with respect to the allegations relating to the strike of textile workers and action taken against the strikers, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the further information which it has requested from the Government.",-1,1959,Argentina
407,".By a communication dated  April , which was sent directly to the I.L.O, the association known as ""Fraternity"" (Association of Railway Engine Staff), Buenos Aires, lodged a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Argentina. This complaint was forwarded to the Government by a letter dated  May , for observations.
.No observations having been received from the Government the Committee decided at its nd Session (Geneva, May ) to adjourn consideration of the case to its next session, a decision of which the Government was notified by a letter dated  June .
.The Government forwarded its reply under cover of a communication dated  September .
.Argentina has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but it has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The "" Fraternity "" complaint is concerned with the mobilisation of the railwaymen under a decree of  November  and with the consequences of this enactment for railway employees. The complaining organisation gives the following description of what happened.
.In November  negotiations were begun between the Railwaymen's Federation, represented by its two constituent organisations, the Railway Union and "" Fraternity "", and the Argentine State Railways Corporation, regarding the payment of back pay as the result of an agreement whereby the railwaymen had been granted a wage increase with retroactive effect. While the workers were demanding immediate and outright payment of the arrears, the Corporation desired to discharge its debt by means of bi-monthly instalments. Owing to the progress of inflation and the falling off in the purchasing power of money which it entailed, the workers did not feel in a position to accept the method which the Corporation desired to impose on them and in protest against the unbending attitude of the Argentine State Railways and in the hope of making their opinions prevail, the railwaymen's unions launched a series of partial stoppages.
.In reply to this strike movement, the Government issued a Decree, No. / dated  November , calling to the Colours the entire staff of the railways and at the same time placing the Railway Union under the control of a military administrator.
.For its part, ""Fraternity"" had issued a strike call to its membership as a result of the mobilisation decree, but cancelled the strike call after receiving a promise from the civilian and military authorities that it would not be affected as a union, in spite of the provisions of the mobilisation decree. Despite this promise, the complainants allege, and despite a provision in a later enactment (Decree No. /) granting "" Fraternity "" trade union freedom, the military authorities in control of the railways are ignoring "" Fraternity "" and continuing their authoritarian management of railway affairs.
.In its reply, the Government begins by stating that as soon as it came to power it endeavoured to restore the ailing economy to health and with that aim in view to set up a system that would make for sound labour-management relations and open an era of industrial peace. To this end the Industrial Associations Act (No. ) was promulgated and in addition the Government took steps to safeguard the rights of the workers by all the Constitutional and administrative means at its command.
.The fact remains, the Government states, that a series of scattered movements, prompted for the most part by political considerations, broke out in Argentina with the object of upsetting the established machinery of Government and obstructing the authorities in the discharge of their Constitutional functions. The country was swept by a wave of strikes launched for reasons other than the defence or furtherance of the workers' interests. The Government quotes several examples of strikes of this nature, which it qualifies as "" insurrection strikes "".
.As regards the appointment of military controllers for certain trade unions, the Government states that this is a normal consequence of the proclamation of a state of emergency. It further points out that only  out of a total of  were placed under military control and that of those  the majority were without leaders at the time the action was taken. In the same way, the Government adds, suspension of trade union activities is a logical and lawful consequence of mobilisation. The Government states that both the High Court judges and the federal Court of Appeal have ruled-in actions brought by certain mobilised railwaymen-that the Government was within the Constitutional rights vested in it in taking the action it did.
.Summing up its general observations the Government declares that it could not impair the right of the trade unions to strike, since this right is expressly guaranteed in article bis of the National Constitution. Naturally, the Government adds, this right, like any other, must be exercised in accordance with the laws that govern it.
.The Government then replies one by one to the specific allegations made by the complaining organisation.
.The complainants allege that the mobilisation of the railwaymen had the effect of postponing sine die the conclusion of discussions on the agreement concerning the salary scale (see paragraph  above), at a stage when the date of its coming into force, among other matters, remained to be determined. In reply to this allegation the Government states that the State Railways Corporation agreed outright to the workers' demand for a retroactive wage increase. This increase, the Government notes, corresponded to a rise of  per cent over the rates of pay applicable on  February , and involved a payment by the Corporation of , million Argentine pesos. There was no adjournment of the negotiations, since the agreement had been accepted ; any delay that resulted was brought about by the workers' refusal to accept the method of payment by instalments which the Corporation suggested.
.The complainants further allege that all questions concerning staff trade union problems were brought to a standstill in all the railway administrations as a result of mobilisation. The Government does not dispute this fact, and explains it by pointing out that, since the workers had come under military authority and become an integral part of the army by reason of their mobilisation, they no longer enjoyed trade union rights and were subject to military discipline alone.
.The Government's reply to the allegations that negotiations for an emergency pay increase based on the sharp rise in the cost of living had been brought to a standstill, is that the dispute was not about the wage increase as such, but rather about the way in which the increase was to be paid, as stated above. Moreover, it would have been beyond the Corporation's powers to lay its hands on a sum of , million Argentine pesos within a month as the workers were then demanding, and as they had continued to demand ever since.
.The complainants contend that the closure of trade union premises, which are under military guard, prevents the holding of trade union meetings and regional congresses. While recognising that certain trade union premises were shut down when it was considered necessary to do so, the Government states that the complaining organisation has not been placed under military control and that the mobilisation order did not have the effect of hampering this organisation's activities, so long as those activities did not infringe the provisions of the mobilisation decree.
.According to the complainants, elections to the management and executive organs of the trade union have had to be adjourned, together with the election of representatives on the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Welfare for the Railways, the Directorate of the Railway Superannuation Fund, the Directorate of the Argentine Railways Corporation and the Central Confederation Committee. The Government's answer is that suspension of the exercise of trade union rights is a consequence of mobilisation. It explains that mobilisation does not entail the abolition of those rights, but merely suspends the exercise thereof to a certain degree.
.The complainants allege that sentences of imprisonment ranging from a few days to more than a year have been passed on more than  persons of "" Fraternity "". These sentences, which are served in army or in other disciplinary units, are said to have been imposed for infringements of military regulations. In its reply, the Government points out that the mobilised workers were under military discipline and that any breach of such discipline carries the punishments duly laid down in the Code o?Military Law.
.Lastly, it is stated by the complainants that mobilisation has brought with it a proliferation of typical military orders, which are incompatible with the agreement on the wage scale and with the regulations and laws presiding over labour-management relations on the railways. The complainants' assertion is that these measures spell the loss of the railwaymen's hard-won rights and gains over a period of many years. The Government does not deny that such measures have been taken, for they follow logically from mobilisation. It does, on the other hand, deny that they imply the loss or suspension of rights derived from agreements on",0,1959,Argentina
408,"wages or other occupational questions.
.In conclusion, the Government states that the most convincing evidence of the respect it professes for workers' rights is the fact that it has repealed the temporary mobilisation measures. Decree No.  of  June  demobilised the railwaymen and the situation throughout the trade union movement has again returned to normal.
.The Committee has already examined in an earlier case t a complaint relating to the same mobilisation of workers on the Argentine railways. The facts then alleged were similar and the Government's reply was, to all intents and purposes, identical with that submitted in the present case.
.On that occasion the Committee found that the mobilisation of the workers concerned resulted in their becoming subject to the provisions of the Military Code and to the administrative disciplinary regulations. It further noted that, although the measure adopted by the Argentine Government was not designed to curtail trade union rights as such but was intended to cope with the emergency created by the railway strike, in practice these rights were nevertheless affected.
.It considered on that occasion that there did not appear to have existed a state of acute national emergency such as the Committee had observed in a case involving the United States, in which it had had to deal with a seizure of the railroads, which had been placed under army control, and in which it had found that the case did not call for further examination only after observing that the seizure in question did not constitute an arbitrary measure, but was essentially dictated by considerations of public interest in a national emergency situation, since it was a question of guaranteeing despatch of supplies and munitions to the United Nations forces in Korea and since the measure had been taken only after exhaustion of all other methods of settlement of the dispute provided by law.
.Accordingly, when examining the previous case mentioned above relating to the mobilisation of Argentine railwaymen, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the possibility of abuse involved in the mobilisation of workers in industrial disputes and to emphasise the undesirability of recourse to such measures, except for the purpose of maintaining essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity.
.As the circumstances in the present case are the same as those in the case on which the Committee made the recommendation set out in the previous paragraph, the Committee considers it appropriate to come to the same conclusion.
.With respect to the placing of certain trade unions under military control, the Committee had to inquire into a similar situation in the Argentine case to which reference has been made above (Case No. ), as well as in Case No. , also relating to Argentina.) On that occasion the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the generally accepted principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.As the Committee is confronted with a similar situation in the present case, it considers it appropriate to make the same recommendation to the Governing Body.
.As for the sentences imposed on certain mobilised workers, it appears from the explanation afforded by the Government that these measures result from the application of the Military Code to which the persons concerned were subject by virtue of the mobilisation order and the proclamation of a state of emergency.
.In many cases in which the Committee has had before it complaints regarding alleged violation of freedom of association under emergency or special legislation, or under a State Security Act, the Committee-while stating that it was not called upon to give an opinion on the necessity or desirability of such legislation, which is a purely political matter-has consistently maintained that it must examine any repercussions that this legislation might have on trade union rights.
.In the present case the Committee observes-as it did in Case No.  mentioned above-that a certain number of mobilised workers have, as the Government itself admits, been sentenced pursuant to legislation which can be assimilated to emergency legislation.
.In these circumstances, the Committee, as it has done in several previous cases, recommends the Governing Body to express the hope that the Government, desirous of seeing labour relations develop in an atmosphere of mutual confidence, will have recourse, when dealing with situations resulting from strikes or lockouts, to measures provided under common law rather than to emergency measures, which involve a danger by reason of their very nature of certain restrictions being placed on fundamental rights.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction the Government's statement to the effect that the order mobilising railwaymen has been rescinded, thereby enabling the trade unions to resume their normal activities. For this reason, and subject to the foregoing observations, it recommends the Governing Body to decide that no useful purpose would be served by a further examination of the case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government, with respect to the mobilisation of the railwaymen, to the fact that the mobilisation of workers in industrial disputes is inconsistent with the exercise of trade union rights ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government, with respect to the placing of certain unions under military control, to the importance which it attaches to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities ;(c) to express the hope, with respect to the sentences passed on certain mobilised workers, that the Government, desirous of seeing labour relations develop in an atmosphere of mutual confidence, will have recourse, when dealing with situations resulting from strikes or lockouts, to measures provided under common law rather than to emergency measures which involve a danger by reason of their very nature of certain restrictions being placed on fundamental right;(d) to take note with satisfaction of the Government's statement to the effect that the order mobilising the railwaymen has been rescinded, thereby enabling the trade unions to resume their normal activities, and for this reason to decide-subject to the observations in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) above-that no useful purpose would be served by further consideration of this case.",-1,1959,Argentina

.In the circumstances the Committee submitted its recommendations on the allegations relating to the strike of railway workers in November , and the manner in which it was refused, to the Governing Body; these recommendations, contained in its th Report, paragraph  (a), (b) and (c), were approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ). Consequently, these allegations will not be taken into consideration in the present report.
.At the same time, the Committee deferred consideration of the allegations concerning the strike of the workers in the refrigeration plant pending receipt of the full reply of the Government. In letters dated  July and  November  the W.F.T.U submitted further information on these allegations, together with new allegations; at the same time the Permanent Liaison Committee of the Unified Workers' Movement of Argentina submitted a further complaint. In a communication dated  June  the Government submitted observations supplementary to those supplied earlier in its letter of  May . The present document is concerned exclusively with the allegations still before the Committee.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the recommendations approved by the Governing Body when it adopted paragraph  (c) of the Committee's th Report and paragraph  (a) and (b) of the Committee's th Report, and to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to the principle, embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by the Argentine Republic, that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to note the reference in the Government's letter of  June  to the statement by the President of the Republic of  December  that the Executive had every intention of bringing all such "" interventions "" to an end as soon as possible, and to return the",-1,1959,Argentina

.In all the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide that, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above, the allegations relating to the strike of workers in the national refrigeration plant (which developed into a general strike) do not call for further examination;(b) to decide, with regard to the allegations relating to the mobilisation of petroleum workers, railwaymen and transport workers, to draw the attention of the Government, as it did with reference to similar allegations in another connection when adopting paragraph  (a) of the Committee's th Report, to the fact that trade union rights may be endangered by the mobilisation of workers in industrial disputes and to emphasise the undesirability of recourse to such measures except for the purpose of maintaining essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity;(c) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to government interference with trade union administration:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the recommendations approved by the Governing Body when it adopted paragraph  (c) of the Committee's th Report and paragraph  (a) and (b) of the Committee's th Report, and to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to the principle, embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by the Argentine Republic, that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(ii) to note the reference in the Government's letter of  June  to the statement by the President of the Republic of  December  that the Executive had every intention of bringing all such "" interventions "" to an end as soon as possible, and to return the administration of the unions to their properly elected authorities;(iii) to note further, however, that in its letter dated  June  the Government does not refute the allegation that the ""intervention "" was still being maintained in the case of a number of important trade union organisations, including the General Confederation of Labour;(iv) to request the Government to inform the Governing Body as to when it intends to permit all the trade unions, including the General Confederation of Labour, to resume their activities in freedom under the administration of their own fully elected officers and committees;(v) to decide, having regard to the ratification by the Argentine Republic of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), to bring these conclusions to the notice of the I.L.O. Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations;(d) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee with respect to the allegations relating to the strike of banking and insurance employees and to the arrest and imprisonment of trade unionists, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report thereon when it has received further information requested from the Government.
.By a communication dated  January  addressed directly to the I.L.O, the World Federation of Trade Unions submitted a complaint containing allegations of infringements of the exercise of trade union rights in the Argentine Republic. The complaint was transmitted to the Government, for its observations, by a letter dated  January .
.At its st Session (Geneva, February ), the Committee decided, as it had not received the Government's observations, to adjourn its examination of the case until its next session. The Government was informed of this decision by a letter dated  March .
.The complaining organisation forwarded further information in substantiation of its complaint by a communication dated  February . This further information was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  March .
.The Government replied by a communication dated  April .
.The Argentine Republic has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government, with respect to the mobilisation of the railwaymen, to the fact that trade union rights may be endangered by the mobilisation of workers in industrial disputes and to emphasise the undesirability of recourse to such measures except for the purpose of maintaining essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity ;(b) to express the hope, with respect to the allegations relating to the prosecution and arrest of organised workers, that the Government, desiring to see labour relations develop in an atmosphere of mutual confidence, will have recourse, when dealing with situations resulting from strikes and lockouts, to measures provided under common law rather than to emergency measures, which involve a danger by reason of their very nature of certain restrictions being placed on fundamental rights;(c) to draw the attention of the Government, with respect to the appointment of military administrators in the case of the Railwaymen's Union and of certain of its locals, to the importance which it attaches to the generally accepted principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.(d) to take note of the present interim report with respect to the allegations relating to the strike of state refrigeration workers, which became general, and to its repression, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the further information promised by the Government.",-1,1959,Argentina
412,".By a communication dated  November  addressed directly to the I.L.O, the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions presented a complaint of alleged infringements of freedom of association by the Government of the Argentine Republic. This complaint was communicated to the Argentine Government for its observations on  November . The Government replied by a letter dated  February .
.The complaint of the I.F.C.T.U related to the new Industrial Associations Act of  August , numerous provisions of which, in the view of the complaining organisation, infringe the fundamental principles relating to freedom of association and, in particular, the guarantees laid down in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the latter of which Conventions has been ratified by the Argentine Republic.
.According to the complainant, while section  of the Act of  August  claims to guarantee freedom of association, this freedom has been completely destroyed by a whole series of other provisions in the Act which set up a trade union monopoly for industrial organisations which fulfil certain conditions of representation laid down by the Act. While numerical minorities and other groups which are not considered representative have the right to form industrial organisations, these are prohibited from styling themselves "" trade unions "" ; they are also forbidden to defend or represent industrial interests against the State and employers if in the same sector there already exists an association which is recognised as a trade union by the Government authorities.
.Thus, declare the complainants, organisations established by workers who do not wish to belong to trade unions enjoying a state-protected monopoly cannot act as trade unions at all. It ensues from section  of the Act that they cannot take part in any of the following activities : (a) defend or represent industrial interests against the State and employers ; (b) defend or represent the individual interests of their single members against financial institutions, in the courts or against any other state organisation ; (c) take part in government bodies for the organisation of labour and social security; (d) intervene in collective negotiations, sign or amend acts and collective agreements, assist in the supervision of social legislation or encourage its extension and improvement ; (e) collaborate with the State as a technical and advisory agent in the examination and solution of problems concerning the occupation ; (f) organise meetings and assemblies without prior authorisation ; (g) establish an endowment fund for mutual benefit societies.
.In consequence, according to the complainants, many workers will have to join a trade union recognised by the State in order to gain satisfaction in disputes or quarrels with employers, State and social security organisations, etc., because the activities of the non-recognised unions are paralysed.
.The complainants then quote sections ,  and  of the Act which lay down the criteria for according to, or withholding from, an industrial organisation the legal status of a trade union. These sections, as cited by the complainants, read as follows:Article . The industrial workers' association that most nearly represents the activity concerned shall have the right to enjoy the legal status of a trade union on the condition that:
.Its rules are adapted to the provisions contained in the previous Act.
.It possesses the largest number of members, thus giving it sufficient powers to represent the activity or category of occupation in the area which it covers.
.It has been exercising trade union rights for at least six months previously.Article . Where there exists an organisation with the legal status of a trade union this status can only be given to another trade union for the same activity when there are more paying members in the latter than in the association with the status of a trade union over a minimum and continuous period of six months prior to the request.Article . When, under the terms of the previous Article, the legal status of a trade union is given to an organisation, the trade union which obtained this status previously loses it if it ceases to be sufficiently representative in character. In deciding whether the trade union whose membership has been surpassed should keep its legal status, its trade union activity and also its contribution to the defence and protection of industrial interests shall be taken into account.
.In the view of the complaining organisation, the criteria laid down in these sections of the Act for endowing an association with the legal status of a trade union or for withdrawing this status are not only very arbitrary but also extremely vague. Further, the complainants declare, "" the Government will be able to make use of these criteria when assessing the importance, value and trends of any trade union activity on the part of an industrial organisation ""; thus, in effect, the Act gives the Government every opportunity of dominating the monopolised trade union movement which, as a result, is in danger of becoming a political instrument of this Government.
.In conclusion, the I.F.C.T.U requests the I.L.O:(a) to request the Government of the Argentine Republic to desist from enforcing the Act complained against;(b) to request the Government of the Argentine Republic to start the necessary proceedings for replacing this Act by another which shall fully comply with freedom of association and trade union rights ;(c) to request the Government of the Argentine Republic to enforce the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by the Argentine Republic ;(d) to invite the Government to proceed as rapidly as possible to ratify and enforce the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.In its reply the Government declares that the Act of  August  does not lay down what the structure of the Argentine trade union movement should be; it merely establishes a legal framework which ensures that occupational organisations are able to operate, certifies that the representative functions vested in them are legitimately theirs and safeguards the rights of the workers belonging to them.
.To assess the merits of this Act and to grasp the purposes of its provisions, declares the Government, it is necessary to take account of the conditions against the background of which it is to be applied. In the Argentine Republic, declares the Government, the workers are out to build up powerful industrial organisations, and to do so they realise that they must take care not to dissipate their strength and so they aim at achieving the greatest possible degree of unity. In support of this statement the Government points out that during the period when Legislative Decree No. / was on the Statute Book-a decree which provided for outright plurality in trade unionism-only very few workers' organisations were set up alongside the existing ones.
.The Government goes on to state that the binding force attaching to collective agreements in the Argentine Republic, even upon third parties who are not signatories thereto, makes it necessary for the authorities to ensure with meticulous care that the associations concluding such agreements are of a truly representative character. For these reasons, the Government considers, the Act in question, conferring as it does preferential rights on the most representative industrial associations, does not appear to be inappropriate to conditions in the Argentine Republic and is not an encroachment on freedom of association.
.In the Government's view, in order to appreciate the extent to which freedom of association is a reality, the position has to be reviewed from three different aspects - the point of view of the relationship of the association to the State, that of the relationship of individuals to their unions and that of the relationship of one association to another.
.With respect to the first of these aspects, the Government declares that the independence of the workers' industrial associations from the State is accorded full recognition in the Act of  August . Section  of this Act provides : "" In no event may the authority administering the Act interfere in the management or administration of any industrial association, whether or not the latter possesses guild status "". Moreover, section  provides expressly that "" suspension or withdrawal of guild status shall not deprive the organisation of the right to continue operating as an ordinary association at common law"".
.From the point of view of the relationship between individuals and their trade unions, the Government declares that freedom of association must be regarded as existing to the extent that individuals are at liberty to join or not to join a union, to discontinue their membership should they so desire, and to belong to unions of their own choosing. All these rights, the Government claims, are fully recognised by the Act of  August .
.With respect to the relationship between one association and another, the Government states that the Act complained against guarantees that workers' organisations are independent of any employers' association or political party, whether national or international, and prohibits workers'",0,1958,Argentina
413,"organisations from receiving funds from such sources (section  of the Act).
.The new legislation, declares the Government, gives the sanction of law to a system of plurality in trade union organisation and of unity in industrial bargaining. In so doing, it clad in legal form a preponderance that the majority union could in any event have attained by its own weight, and in this weight lies the justification for the special legal capacity with which the Act endows it. Thus, the sole purpose of the new enactment is to give effect to the democratic principle of majority rule.
.The Government adds:There can be no doubt that, if it were not desired to distinguish between various classes of associations in the Act, the legislator might have opted for putting them all on the same footing, irrespective of how representative they were and how many members they possessed ; but in such a case the only rights they could be accorded would be those derived from the Constitutional guarantees of freedom of the individual, freedom of association and freedom to petition the authorities. One should not, however, confuse the rights proceeding from these guarantees with the special trade union rights instituted for the purposes of the necessary representation of a trade or occupational category. This essential distinction is not made in those enactments that lump all occupational organisations into the same class and eschew the system of guild status. Such enactments require organisations to furnish proof of their representative character, or lay down procedures whereby this may be determined, before the organisations are allowed to enter into commitments (e.g. collective agreements) on behalf of the trade or occupation as a whole.
.The Government affirms, further, that the choice of the system to be adopted rules out any risk of arbitrary action on the part of the administrative authorities because section  of the Act of  August  gives a right of appeal to the courts in any matter relating to guild status.
.The Government declares in its reply that the complaint of the I.F.C.T.U lists all the exclusive powers which section  of the Act grants to the most representative industrial associations, but omits all reference to the powers which section  of the same Act accords to the remaining organisations which are merely registered. Contrary to what the complainants appear to allege, the latter organisations are not completely forbidden to defend and represent industrial interests vis--vis the State and the employers. Only in the event of there being in the relevant trade or occupation one or more associations with recognised guild status must they refrain from exercising the rights which appertain exclusively to such associations. This system does not imply that associations which are merely registered cannot take action to protect and represent their membership or that they cannot obtain corporate status as ordinary associations and petition in furtherance of occupational interests. The difference between the industrial associations with guild status and those which are merely registered lies in the fact that the former act as the statutory bargaining agents for the trade or occupation as a whole, whereas the latter may only undertake acts of stewardship to uphold the interests of the said trade or occupation.
.In conclusion, the Government affirms that the Act of  August  in no way infringes the provisions of International Labour Conventions Nos.  and , that it does not set up a trade union monopoly for workers' industrial organisations that possess guild status, that it does not forbid organisations which are merely registered to exercise trade union functions and that it does not give the Government opportunities of dominating the trade union movement, thus permitting it to transform it into a political tool.
.It would appear, both from the allegations made by the complainants and from the observations presented by the Government, that the essential question in the case as a whole consists in the distinction made by the Act of  August  between "" ordinary "" occupational associations and those which enjoy "" guild status "". The complainants and the Government ascribe a very different meaning and scope to this distinction. Accordingly, before any conclusion can be formulated, it is necessary to examine the actual text of the Act.
.Section  of the Act provides that workers shall be entitled to establish and join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation. Section  prohibits any trade union discrimination. However, a concept is introduced in Chapters IV and V of the Act which had previously been abandoned, namely the distinction between ordinary organisations and organisations having trade union status.
.The essential criterion governing the granting or refusal of trade union status is the degree of representativeness of the organisation concerned, this being determined in its turn principally on the basis of the size of its membership compared with the memberships of the other organisations, but also on the contribution made by the organisation concerned towards the defence and protection of occupational interests.
.On several occasions, and especially when the draft text of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention was being discussed, the Conference has had to consider the question of the representative character of workers' and employers' organisations ; it accepted to some extent the distinction which certain countries draw between various organisations according to the extent to which they are representative. Article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the I.L.O recognises the concept of "" most representative "" organisations. The distinction made by the new Argentine Act between two categories of trade union organisations could not therefore give rise to criticism in itself.
.It is nevertheless necessary to consider, in the light of the texts, what are the criteria for, and the consequences of, such a distinction.
.Although a distinction made between organisations according to whether they are more or less representative may be admissible in itself, it is necessary that the criteria for determining such distinction shall be objective and be based on prescriptions which give rise to no possibility of abuse.
.According to section  of the Argentine Act, an organisation cannot obtain trade union status if there already exists an organisation enjoying such status unless the number of its members exceeds the number of members belonging to the union already having this status. Section  provides that a union enjoying trade union status will lose that status if it ceases to be sufficiently representative in character. It is also stated in that section : "" In determining whether the association with the smaller membership should retain its trade union status, account shall be taken of the number of its members, its trade union activity and its contribution to the defence and protection of occupational interests.""
.The Committee considers that the imprecise nature of the terms of the part of the section which is cited above might permit of abuse when the decision is taken by the Government whether or not to permit a particular trade union to retain its trade union status.
.It would seem that the independence of occupational organisations in relation to the public authorities might be compromised if the legislator or the executive power can effect a discrimination between the various organisations concerned which is not based on objective criteria, and even more so where-as will be seen to be the case subsequently when the Argentine Act is analysed-the consequences of the distinction between the different organisations are to reserve to certain organisations a monopoly both in respect of the determination of conditions of employment (collective bargaining, etc.) and in respect of the representation and defence of the interests of the workers in relation to the public authorities.
.In this latter connection the consequences of the distinction between organisations which do not and those which do possess trade union status are defined in sections  and  of the Act, which specify the functions and rights of these two types of organisation. Section  provides that the rights and functions listed therein are reserved exclusively to organisations which have trade union status. The rights thus accorded by section  exclusively to organisations enjoying trade union status include-participation in the work of the public bodies concerned with the regulation of labour and social security, the negotiation and conclusion of collective agreements, collaboration with the State in a technical and advisory capacity in the study and solution of problems of concern to the occupation represented by the organisation, the holding of meetings without obtaining prior authorisation, the defence and representation of the individual interests of the members of the organisation vis--vis the social security institutions, courts of law and other public bodies and, finally, the defence and representation of occupational interests vis--vis the State and the employers. It is true that the last, mentioned right is also accorded to ordinary organisations, but section  of the Act nevertheless provides that they may enjoy this right only where no association with trade union status exists in the branch of activity concerned.
.Among the activities in which ordinary organisations may engage, section  of the Act mentions the establishment",4,1958,Argentina
414,"of provident and welfare institutions, holiday camps, canteens, hospitals, etc., the formation of producers' and consumers' co operatives, the promotion of general and vocational education by setting up libraries, laboratories, etc. From the strictly trade union point of view therefore, the role assigned to these organisations is extremely limited. According to the definition contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) the term "" organisation "" means ""any organisation of workers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers or of employers "". It is clear from a perusal of the Act that even if that may be the object which is pursued by ordinary organisations, they lack the means of attaining it and the means of action open to such organisations are particularly limited.
.In its reply, the Government states that the difference between the functions of organisations having legal status and those of ordinary organisations resides solely in the fact that the former act as the statutory bargaining agents for the trade or occupation, whereas the latter may only undertake acts of stewardship to uphold the interests of the trade or occupation. In the final analysis, the whole system of industrial relations rests on the associations which enjoy trade union status and these organisations appear to be the only ones to possess the means to defend and promote the interests of the workers ; the other organisations of workers are deprived by the Act of such essential trade union functions as the conclusion of collective agreements in addition to that of defending and promoting occupational interests.
.In these circumstances, having regard to the fact that the distinction made by the Act between organisations enjoying trade union status and ordinary organisations results, in particular, in the latter organisations being unable to defend occupational interests against the employers, to hold meetings without previous authorisation and to conclude collective agreements-this point being of particular importance in the Argentine Republic, where the collective agreements may be extended to third parties who have not taken part in their negotiation and conclusion-it would seem that organisations which do not have trade union status do not have the right to organise in freedom their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. Further, in view of the limited functions which are assigned to these organisations, it may be wondered whether the distinction does not infringe the generally recognised principle that workers shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing-a principle which is embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.By including the words "" organisations of their own choosing "" in the said Convention, the Conference made allowance for the fact that in certain countries there are a number of different workers' and employers' organisations which an individual may choose to join for occupational, denominational or political reasons ; but it did not pronounce upon the question whether it is in the interest of workers and employers to have unified organisations rather than a number of separate ones. But it also recognised thereby the right of any group of workers (or employers) to form breakaway organisations if they think this desirable to safeguard their material or moral interests.
.The Convention also lays down that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes (Article ) and that the acquisition of legal personality by workers' and employers' organisations shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the guarantees laid down in the Convention (Article ), which guarantees include the freedom of choice of organisation by the workers and the right of organisations to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes.
.Finally, it may be appropriate to refer here to the observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at its last session (April ) according to which in certain cases a prohibition of the establishment of an occupational organisation capable of "" furthering and defending the interests "" of its members may result from the "" recognition "" by the Government of another organisation. The Committee went on: ""This is clearly the case, for example, when the law itself specifies the privileged organisation by name. It may also be the case where the regulations relating to recognition impose on the organisations of workers concerned a form which may restrict their freedom of action and do not lay down objective criteria for the recognition for a fixed period of an organisation for the purposes of representation or negotiation "".
.In the present case it would appear that only organisations which enjoy trade union status are able to "" further and defend the interests "" of their members, and that organisations to which this status is not assigned are unable to perform such functions.
.There would seem to be no doubt that the privileged position thus accorded to organisations having trade union status may indirectly operate against the freedom of the workers to join organisations of their own choosing. This opinion, moreover, was expressed by the Committee when it had before it another case in which the trade union system in force in the Argentine Republic at the time was the subject of a complaint.
.In that case, noting that the regulations then in force did not place on the same footing ordinary organisations and recognised trade unions, the Committee, "" having regard to the fact that the privileged status accorded to recognised trade unions may indirectly operate against the freedom of workers, to belong to organisations of their own choosing "" took the view that it would be desirable for the Government to reconsider the distinction made between recognised trade unions and other trade union organisations.
.In another case, relating to Brazil, in which it had to examine a system which had many features in common with that in force in the Argentine Republic, the Committee expressed the following opinion:It may, however, be asked whether, simply because the approved unions enjoy, to the exclusion of other organisations, privileges of paramount importance in the defence of occupational interests, wage earners are not indirectly obliged to belong to the approved unions. It does happen that the legislation in other countries without any intention of discrimination confers on recognised unions, which are in fact the most representative, certain privileges in connection with the defence of occupational interests which only they are in a position to perform effectively. But the granting of such privileges may not be made subject to conditions of such a nature as to bring into question through their operation the fundamental guarantees of freedom of association.
.Following this precedent and having regard to the fact that the conditions present in the case now before it are similar in many respects to those which it had to consider when it examined Case No.  relating to the Argentine Republic, the Committee, while noting that the laws now in force are not the same laws as were in force when it examined the earlier case, considers that the privileged status accorded to organisations which enjoy trade union status considerably limits the means of action open to organisations which do not have such status and may indirectly operate against the freedom of workers to belong to organisations of their own choosing, and recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Argentine Government to the desirability of considering whether it would not be possible to abolish the distinction made by the Act of  August  between organisations which enjoy trade union status and other trade union organisations.
.Finally, with respect to a more specific point, the Committee has noted that, according to sections  and  of the Act read together, organisations which do not enjoy trade union status are prohibited from holding meetings without previous authorisation. The right to hold meetings in freedom is an integral part of the right of trade unions to function freely. This is the point of view that the Committee has expressed whenever it has been called upon to examine a complaint containing allegations of infringements of the free exercise of the right of trade union meeting. In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations emphasised in  that "" the degree of freedom enjoyed by occupational organisations in determining and organising their activities depends very largely upon certain legislative provisions of general application relating to the right of free meeting, the right of free expression and, in general, to civil and political liberties enjoyed by the inhabitants of a country "". From this point of view also, the considerable limitation placed on the means of action open to organisations which do not enjoy trade union status by the fact that they cannot hold meetings without previous authorisation would disappear if the distinction between these two",4,1958,Argentina
415,"types of organisation was abolished.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to suggest to the Government that it may give consideration to ratifying the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) in the near future ;(b) to suggest to the Government that it might consider amending its legislation, with a view to bringing it into complete harmony with the principles contained in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).Geneva,  May .

This complaint was communicated to the Government on  February .
.On  January  the A.S.A. presented a series of allegations concerning the same strike, which were communicated to the Government on  February . The A.S.A. supplemented its complaint by a letter dated  March , the contents of which were communicated to the Government on  March .
.On  March  the P.T.T.I presented voluminous documentation containing allegations to the effect that trade union rights had been violated in connection with the disputes which broke out in telegraph and telephone occupations during September, October and November . This complaint was communicated to the Government in a letter dated  March .
.In a communication dated  October  the Government of the Argentine Republic forwarded its observations on the various complaints which had been transmitted to it.
.At is th Session (November ) the case was referred to the Committee, which submitted an interim report to the Governing Body, approved by it at its th Session (- November ).
.In discussing the case at its session in November  the Committee dealt with certain of the allegations (relating to the illegality of the strike of telegraph and telephone personnel, to the suspension of the registration of associations, and to the mobilisation of bank employees). It considered that on other points, for it to be able to form an opinion in full knowledge of the facts, it would be necessary to obtain additional information from the Government regarding the allegations concerning the prosecutions and detention of trade unionists and the placing of certain trade union organisations under administrative control.
.The decisions taken by the Governing Body on the Committee's recommendations and the requests for additional information were brought to the Government's attention in a communication from the Director-General dated  November .
.At its st Session (February ), in view of the absence of the additional information requested from the Government, the Committee decided to adjourn examination of the case to its next session. The Government was informed of this decision in a letter dated  March .
.In a communication dated  April , supplemented on  April, the A.S.A. submitted a new complaint to the I.L.O relating this time to the dispute which has been in existence since the beginning of  between Argentine bank employees and their employers. This complaint was supported on  May  by the I.F.C.T.U.
.The new complaint by the A.S.A. and the supplementary information transmitted in support of it were communicated to the Government for observation in two letters dated  April and  May .
.At its nd Session (May ), in view of the absence both of the additional information previously requested from the Government and of any observations by the Government on the latest complaint by the A.S.A., the Committee decided to adjourn the examination of the case to its next session. The Government was informed of this decision of the Committee in a letter dated  June .
.In a communication dated  September  the Argentine Government forwarded to the office a further set of observations on the complaints of violation of freedom of association which had been submitted against it.
.When the case was again referred to the Committee at its rd Session (November ), it submitted a second interim report to the Governing Body, which was approved by the latter at its th Session (- March ).
.During its examination of the case at its November  Session, the Committee dealt with some of the outstanding allegations (the question of the legality of the  bank strike, and allegations relating to the general position of the trade union movement). However, it considered that it was necessary for it to obtain from the Government additional information on certain points concerning the allegations relating to the prosecution and the detention of trade unionists, and to the placing of certain trade union organisations under administrative control.
.The requests for additional information were sent to the Argentine Government in a letter from the Director-General dated  November .
.At its th Session (February ) the Committee, in the absence of the additional information requested from the Government, decided to adjourn the examination of the case to its next session.
.In a communication dated  February  the Government of the Argentine Republic forwarded to the Office a further set of observations concerning the complaints of violation of freedom of association which had been submitted against it.
.The following paragraphs deal solely with the allegations pending since the approval by the Governing Body of the Committee's st Report.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). The first of these Conventions entered into force for Argentina on  January , whereas the second entered into force on  September .
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's declared intention to bring to an end all control of the Banking Association and to express the hope that the removal of this control will take place in the near future;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle set forth in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina, that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict trade union rights or impede the lawful exercise by workers' organisations of their right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes;(c) to decide that, subject to the observations contained in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, and for the reasons given in paragraphs  to  of the present report, the case as a whole does not call for further examination.
.On  February  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions addressed to the Director-General of the International Labour Office a letter containing allegations that freedom of association had been infringed in Argentina in connection with the bank strike that occurred in the months of February and March . his complaint was communicated to the Government on  February .
.On  January  the organisation known as Argentine Trade Union Action (A.S.A.) put forward a series of allegations concerning the same strike. These allegations were communicated to the Government on  February . Argentine Trade Union Action supplemented its complaint by a letter dated  March , and the Government was informed of the contents of that letter on  March .
.On  March  the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International submitted an extensive series of documents containing allegations that freedom of association had been infringed in connection with the disputes that broke out among telegraph and telephone workers in the months of September, October and November . This complaint was forwarded to the Government by a letter dated  March .
.By a communication dated  October  the Government of the Argentine Republic submitted its observations regarding the various complaints that had been communicated to it.
.The case was submitted to the Committee at its November  (th) Session, and the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva,  to  November ).
.When it examined the case at its meeting in November , the Committee dealt with certain of the allegations that had been put forward (allegations relating to the illegality of the strike of telegraph and telephone workers, the suspension of the registration of associations and the mobilisation of bank employees). On the other hand it took the view that on certain points it would be necessary, if the Committee was to be in a position to reach a decision based on a full knowledge of all the relevant factors, to obtain additional information from the Government with regard to the allegations relating to the prosecution and detention of trade unionists and the placing of certain trade union organisations under administrative control.
.The decisions taken by the Governing Body on the Committee's recommendation, together with the requests for additional information, were transmitted to the Government by a communication from the Director-General dated  November .
.Since it had not received the additional information requested from the Government the Committee decided at its February  (st) Session to postpone consideration of the case until its next session. The Government was informed of this decision by a letter dated  March .
.By a communication dated  April , supplemented by another on  April, Argentine Trade Union Action lodged a new complaint with the I.L.O, this time with regard to the dispute between Argentine bank employees and their employers that had begun early in",-1,1958,Argentina

.This further complaint by Argentine Trade Union Action and the additional information submitted in support of it were communicated to the Government for its observations in two letters dated  April and  May  respectively.
.At its May  (nd) Session, and in the absence of the additional information previously requested from the Government and of the observations expected from it concerning the latest complaint by Argentine Trade Union Action, the Committee decided to postpone consideration of the case until its next session. The Government was informed of this decision of the Committee by letter dated  June .
.In a communication dated  September  the Argentine Government transmitted to the Office a further series of observations with regard to the complaints alleging violation of freedom of association that had been lodged against it.
.The following paragraphs related exclusively to the allegations consideration of which had been suspended since the th Session of the Governing Body (November ) and to those contained in the further complaint by Argentine Trade Union Action which has not yet been submitted to the Committee.
.Argentina has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, as regards the placing of the Banking Association under administrative control, to draw the Government's attention to the importance which it attaches to the generally accepted principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, and to ask the Government to be good enough to inform it whether the control of the trade union organisation in question has been ended ;(b) to decide, with regard to the question of the legality of the banking strike of , that, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  to  above, this aspect of the case does not call for further examination ;(c) to decide, with regard to the allegations relating to the general position of the trade union movement, that, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  to  above, it would be purposeless to consider this aspect of the case further ; and(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further on the aspects of the case which are still outstanding when it has received the information requested from the Government.

.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to the illegality of the strike of telegraph and telephone employees and its effects on trade union rights, to draw the attention of the Government to the desirability of considering the possibility of effecting an improvement in the existing system for the settlement of disputes in state-owned undertakings by affording the guarantee of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage ;(b) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to suspension of the registration of associations, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the right of meeting and the principle that organisations representing the workers should be recognised for collective bargaining purposes, and to draw its attention to the fact that the suspension by administrative measures of a trade union is contrary to one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association ;(c) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to the detention of trade unionists, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict trade union rights or impede the lawful exercise thereof, but to decide, having regard to the fact that the examining magistrate found that there were no proper grounds for the detentions and the persons concerned were released within three days, that no useful purpose would now be served by examining further this aspect of the case ;(d) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to arrests of trade unionists and the illegality of the bank employees' strike, to express the hope that the Government, desiring to see labour relations develop in an atmosphere of mutual confidence, will have recourse, when dealing with situations resulting from strikes and lockouts, to measures provided for under common law rather than to emergency measures, which involve a danger, by reason of their very nature, of certain restrictions being placed on fundamental rights ;(e) to decide, with respect to the appointment of a controller of the Argentine Bank Employees' Association, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the generally accepted principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, and to request the Government to furnish information as to whether the appointment of the controller for the trade union in question has now been cancelled ;(f) to decide, with respect to the allegations relating to the mobilisation of bank employees, in view of the serious consequences which a measure of this kind may imply for workers and for the exercise of their trade union rights, to draw the attention of the Government to the possibility of abuse involved in the mobilisation of workers in industrial disputes and to emphasise the undesirability of recourse to such measures except for the purpose of maintaining essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity ;(g) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee with respect to the outstanding allegations in this case, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the observations requested from the Government.",0,1958,Argentina
418,".In its communication dated  April  the Trade Unions International of Leather, Shoe, Fur and Leather Products Workers (W.F.T.U) states that trade union leaders have been persecuted in Argentina, and that some - including Mr. Rubens Iscaro and other workers-have been imprisoned for a long time. In its subsequent communication, dated  June , the complainant organisation submits the names of seven other workers who, it alleged, were under arrest in  and . According to this organisation, the Argentine Ministry of the Interior stated that  workers were under arrest.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its communications dated  July and  August  the Argentine Government states that the complaint by this Trade Unions International refers to a matter on which the Committee had already taken a decision, namely regarding the situation of the persons detained by the Executive during the state of siege. The Government continues to the following effect : several of the persons mentioned in the communication of  June  had already figured in complaints received in the former case ; the Governing Body, after taking note that the arrests had been ordered for security reasons against persons who had committed subversive activities or sabotage, expressed "" its satisfaction at the measures taken by the Government with a view to restoring fully freedom of association."" ; evidence of the development in this direction is provided by Resolution No.  (a copy of which is appended to the Government's reply), which orders convocation of an extraordinary general meeting of workers' occupational associations in order to approve the statutes of the General Confederation of Labour and to elect its officers on a regular basis.
.Furthermore, the Government states, the new complaint by the Trade Unions International has no longer any object, since it deals with arrests made in  and  during the state of siege ; this was abolished throughout the territory of the Republic by Decree No.  of  June , and all the persons detained by the Executive  in all-were released ; Mr. Rubens Iscaro was one of the persons now at liberty ; at present any persons still detained could only be those sentenced by a court of law to imprisonment for ordinary penal offences ; but such cases, the Government concludes, have of course nothing to do with the present allegations.
.The Trade Unions International of Leather, Shoe, Fur and Leather Products Workers states that trade union officials were detained in Argentina in  and  ; that these included Mr. Rubens Iscaro ; and that the Ministry of the Interior has recognised that some  workers were detained by the Executive. The Government, on the other hand, points out that the present complaint refers to facts already examined by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, namely the situation of the persons detained by the Executive during the state of siege. The Government recalls the conclusions adopted by the Governing Body in the said case, and states that the observations then presented apply also in the present instance. Furthermore, as the state of siege referred to in the complaint was raised throughout Argentine territory by Decree No.  of  June  the Government describes the present complaint as one which has no longer any object ; it states that the  persons detained by the Executive, including Mr. Rubens Iscaro, the person specifically mentioned by the complainant organisation, were released when the state of siege was raised on that date.
.In these circumstances, having regard to the fact that it examined in its th Report the position of the persons detained by the Executive during the state of siege in  and  and to the fact that this situation ceased with the raising of such state of siege and the release of all the persons who had been detained by the Executive, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that it would be purposeless to examine the present complaint further.",-1,1957,Argentina
419,".The complaint of the Latin American Confederation of Workers (W.F.T.U) is contained in two communications dated  March and  April , which are analysed separately.Communication of  March 
.According to this communication an outbreak of repression directed against all trade union organisations has occurred in Argentina, in violation of the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The state of siege is alleged to be the means used by the provisional Government to break into premises belonging to trade unions, imprison leaders and prohibit trade union meetings. It is claimed that members of the armed forces, who can in no way represent the interests of the workers, have been placed at the head of trade union organisations. Over  trade union leaders and active unionists are said to have been relegated to Patagonia and confined in a concentration camp. They include Rubens Iscaro, General Secretary of the Movement for Trade Union Democratisation and Independence and a leader of the Building Workers' Union, whose home is alleged to have been attacked by the police at daybreak on  December .Communication of  April 
.It is alleged that on  January  two newspaper sellers were arrested for selling the paper Nuestra Palabra. It is alleged that at Mar del Plata two building workers were dragged off as "" disturbers of the peace "" and transferred to the National Penitentiary. It is said that Messrs. Luis Martinez, Ulises Zangoititas and Rodolfo Weidman, of the Insurance Workers' Union, were arrested in Buenos Aires. A worker of the "" Atlanta "" firm who had supported a strike by the personnel of the factory is alleged to have been arrested on  January and sentenced to  days' imprisonment as an "" agitator "". In December  the police are said to have "" attempted to deprive of their liberty "" the construction workers Andrs Ibarrolla, Amado Ibarrolla and Domingo Moner. They are said to have been ordered to report to the police station at Quilmes. Forty offenders sentenced to  days' imprisonment are said to be detained in the prison of Villa Devoto. It is claimed that in the National Penitentiary good conduct certificates are demanded of members of their households who wish to visit prisoners. There is said to be a warrant for the arrest of Victor Vzquez ; his house is said to have been broken into and books confiscated. Vzquez is alleged to have been sentenced to  days' imprisonment for breach of the new police regulations : owing to the opposition of the public prosecutor the writ of habeas corpus applied for on his behalf was not granted. Francisco Mazo, E. F. Vai and Simn Gamarnik are said to be under permanent arrest at the pleasure of the Government so that the application made to a court in La Plata for a writ of habeas corpus has not been granted. It is said that the rights of the defence are restricted and that in most cases the judges themselves reject applications for writs of habeas corpus. The publication of Unidad Sindical, Vocero, Lucha Obrera, El Federal, Derechos del Hombre and other papers is said to be prohibited. The complaining organisation also submits an "" incomplete "" list of the imprisoned trade unionists and of political prisoners "" in the following penal establishments : the prison of Rio Gallegos (Santa Cruz), the Women's' Reformatory, the San Miguel Asylum, the prison of Viedma (Rio Negro), the National Penitentiary, the prison of Olmos (La Plata), the jail of the Department of La Plata (Province of Buenos Aires), the prison of Villa Devoto (Federal Capital), the prison of Esquel (Chubut), the police station at Caseros (Province of Buenos Aires) and "" southern prisons "". Of the names mentioned it is said that E. F. Vai was tortured in the prison of Viedma and Leonardo Gmez in the police station at Caseros. Pedro Castagno and Sal Veloso are said to be detained in the prison of Villa Devoto (Federal Capital) and to be threatened with deportation.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.The Argentine Government submitted its observations in communications dated  May and  November  and  February , which are analysed separately.Communication of  May 
.In this communication the Argentine Government replies to the allegations submitted by the Confederation of Workers of Latin America on  March . The policy followed in the labour field is outlined as follows in the declaration of principles of the revolutionary Government : "" To establish freedom of association so as to ensure the genuine democratic operation, outside the field of party politics, of occupational organisations and trade unions, which the Government will make a special point of supporting ; to take government action to guarantee that real social justice shall prevail in an atmosphere of freedom ; the gains and rights of the workers to be fully recognised and further increased ; one of the Government's basic intentions is to achieve a real advance in the living conditions of the lower income brackets "". Although the provisional Government has been compelled to order arrests in accordance with its objectives and with a view to maintaining its stability and public order, nobody has been arrested merely owing to the fact he is a worker or a trade union leader. Where persons have been arrested or prosecuted this action has been taken owing to ordinary offences or misdemeanours having absolutely no relation to the fact that these persons are workers. Thus Rubens Iscaro was arrested at his home by the police by order of the competent authority and in accordance with due process of law Iscaro and other political leaders have been accommodated (and not "" relegated "") in a number of penal establishments (and not in "" concentration camps ""). Whilst a state of siege does in a way limit the rights of the individual it does not abolish them, since it is always possible to put up a defence either through administrative channels or by resort to the courts. These arrests were ordered exclusively with an eye to political activities connected with the former totalitarian rgime ; the Government appointed an administrator to run the affairs of the General Confederation of Labour and its affiliates in order to restore order in the management of the unions and to put an end to the venality and corruption of the leaders imposed on the movement by the dictatorship that has been overthrown. This intervention in the management of the unions was, moreover, intended to guarantee that within a period which was wisely kept short (within  days of  May ) really free elections would be held within the unions.Communication of  November 
.In this communication the Argentine Government transmits a memorandum of the Ministry of the Interior referring chiefly to the allegations put forward by the Latin American Confederation of Workers on  April . The Government begins by stating that, although all the necessary steps were taken to collect all the facts, the inadequate identification of the persons whose imprisonment is denounced by the Latin American Confederation of Workers held up the inquiry. In particular there have been cases of homonym, as with regard to Luis Martinez-one of the most common names-which called for the consultation of over  entries. In addition, it should be borne in mind that since Argentina is a federal State, each province, as well as the federal capital territory, has its own system of identification. Individual police files and the records of penal establishments are organised on the basis of identity numbers. In this country, however, there is no general register from which it can be determined whether a person is or is not being prosecuted in some particular province. Moreover, in each province the identity index cards give only the final judgment in the case and do not mention the mere fact of a prosecution. The Government states that in the light of these explanations the persons mentioned in the complaint of the Latin American Confederation of Workers dated  April  can be classified in two categories : () persons in the hands of the Government ; and () persons detained by other authorities.
.As regards the first category, "" persons in the hands of the Government "", the provision that entitles the Government to proceed in this manner is Act No.  of  September , proclaiming a state of siege. According to article  of the Argentine Constitution of , "" in the event of an interior disturbance or an external attack that imperils the functioning of this Constitution and of the authorities set up thereby, a state of siege shall be proclaimed in the province or territory where public order is disturbed and Constitutional guarantees shall be suspended therein, provided that whilst these guarantees are suspended the President of the Republic may not convict on his own or impose sentences. In such a case his power over persons shall be limited to that of arresting them or transferring",-1,1956,Argentina
420,"them from one part of the country to another, unless they prefer to leave Argentine territory."" In a list of names appended to its reply the Government gives the names of the persons in the hands of the Government, stating the date of arrest, the number of the Decree ordering the arrest and the date of release. On the date of the Government's communication only  persons were in this position. The Government gives their names, the dates of their arrests and the number of the Decree in each case. The fact that these persons are in the hands of the Government does not mean that the Constitutional guarantee of due process of law has been abrogated with regard to them. According to the jurisprudence of the Argentine Supreme Court, whose judgments the Government quotes, "" the detention of those convicted does not constitute a punishment but a preventive security measure which may be stopped by taking advantage of the option to leave the country "" (Judgments, Vol. , , p. ). According to another decision (Judgments, Vol. , , p. ), "" the intention behind the Constitution is to reconcile the need to maintain public order, which is the proper atmosphere for freedom, with the protection granted by the Constitution to the rights of the individual. So long as the person arrested or transferred has not signified his intention [of exercising his right to leave the country] the restriction of his liberty is Constitutionally valid ; if he signifies his intention and is allowed to go, no action lies in law ; if he is denied [the right to leave] or if it is made subject to restrictions that are contrary to law, the courts become competent to act in the defence of the right that has been ignored. This ensures that the purposes of article  [of the Constitution] are achieved ; each power operates within its own field and none of the guarantees of article  [of the Constitution : rights of the individual] are endangered.""
.The Government explains that the existence of a state of siege is due to the fact that the country has been going through a period of revolution after the overthrow in September  of a totalitarian dictatorship. With a view to the prompt restoration of the republican democratic rgime provided for in the Constitution of , the present revolutionary Government has been compelled to maintain a state of siege as provided for in the Constitution itself, and this makes it necessary at times to impose a minimum of restrictions on individual rights, while respecting the Constitutional guarantee of due legal process. The Government has issued writs for an election to be held in . It should be stated that the existing state of siege, which is a legal position provided for in the Constitution, represents the abolition of the "" internal state of war "" imposed on the country by the former dictatorship in violation of Constitutional rules. In addition, one of the first steps taken by the revolutionary Government was to guarantee the absolute independence of the judiciary. The allegation that some of those arrested have been arbitrarily deprived of the possibility of habeas corpus proceedings-besides being a gratuitous accusation-cannot be remedied by the Executive but through applications by those concerned to the competent appeals courts.
.The Government encloses an alphabetical list of the names of the persons who are mentioned by the complainant and whom it has not been possible to identify for the reasons previously stated. In any case none of these persons is now under arrest. At the most they would be offenders sentenced for minor offences or misdemeanours. Sentences of imprisonment for such criminal offences do not exceed  days. The regulations governing misdemeanours lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of each province. Generally speaking the proceedings for dealing with misdemeanours are summary : there are two instances and a defendant can submit evidence and appeal to a higher court. The offender may even by special appeal (on ground of unconstitutional action) go so far as the country's Supreme Court. The provincial laws guarantee due legal process for trials relating to minor offences and misdemeanours. The Government states that if the organisation which made the complaint were to supply more information (identification certificates, date and place of arrest, province, etc.), thus enabling the identification of the persons in question, it would perhaps be possible to carry out more thorough inquiries. At all events all the persons concerned had broken laws relating to offences or had committed misdemeanours, and had either served their sentences at the time of the Government's reply or were never arrested.
.In conclusion, the Government refers to other charges that are so vague that it cannot reply in detail. It has not been possible to find any trace of the alleged cases of torture. The Government draws attention to the fact that the Latin American Confederation of Workers has not stated to what court the relatives of the tortured men submitted their complaints. The law courts are always available to relatives to deal with all speed with complaints relating to illegal arrest and torture, which constitute offences under the Argentine laws. With respect to the allegations regarding the freedom of the press, the Government states that  dailies and other periodicals are published in the country. Only six of them belong to the Government, and even the editors of these six papers have freedom of opinion. It can be imagined that a tremendous percentage of the publications defend ideas in opposition to those of the Government. The prohibition of distribution-and not of freedom of expression--has in some cases been necessary for security reasons since a certain section of the press followed the directions of the deposed dictatorship and had adopted an attitude that was directly subversive. Such restrictions on individual freedom under a state of siege have been recognised as being legitimate by decisions of the national Supreme Court. Apart from these restrictions, newspapers and reviews of the most varied tendencies enjoy full freedom of expression ; and numerous political and trade union public meetings have been held. Authorisation to hold public meetings has not been refused to any party, including the Communist Party of Argentina. Since September  more than , political speeches of various tendencies have been broadcast.Communication of  February 
.In this communication the Argentine Government states that, of the  persons listed in their letter of  November  as having been arrested and placed at the disposition of the executive authorities, four have been released (one of them choosing to leave the country) and that the Government is now considering the cases of the other persons arrested. On  February  the Minister of the Interior, Dr. Carlos Alconoda Aramburu, declared : "" The revolutionary Government, respecting human rights and the law, has arrested no one by reason of his political opinions. It is only in proven cases of subversion endangering social peace or of sabotage against the national patrimony that the Government has found itself obliged to exercise the powers conferred upon it by article  of the Constitution."" The Government also transmits the text of a judgment of the Supreme Court, dated  December , dismissing the appeal of Mr. Rubens Iscaro and others against a refusal of habeas corpus by the lower court. With respect to the newspapers Vocero, Derechos del Hombre, El Federal (organ of the former Government Party in the province of Crdoba), and Lucha Obrera (organ of the National Revolutionary Socialist Party allied with the former Government Party), their publication has been suspended, states the Government, by reason of the fact that they engaged in subversive propaganda in favour of the rgime abolished by the revolution.
.In a statement made on  February  the Controller of the General Confederation of Labour declared that, first degree elections having taken place in the trade unions throughout the country-these organisations having been handed back to their members-steps are now being taken to hold elections in the federations, which will be followed by an end of the control of the federations. He said that the Electrical and Motive Power Workers' Federation was the first to be handed back to its legitimate administrators, elected by the workers in a truly democratic election. The statement ended with the declaration that the extraordinary general meeting of the electrical and motive power workers had approved everything that had been done during the period of control and that the other federations would, in turn, soon be handed back to the workers. The Government adds that , of the , trade unions have been handed back to their own administrations, following new elections, and that the same step will be taken with respect to the remainder. In the case of federations, the Government states that  have already been convened for the purpose of electing their administrations and that the remaining ones will be convened before the end of March. After that the same measures will",-1,1956,Argentina
421,"be taken in the case of the General Confederation of Labour.
.The allegations which the Committee is called upon to examine refer to various governmental measures towards the end of  and in the early months of , i.e. during a period of grave political disturbance in Argentina, which was then under martial law. The Government to which the complainant organisation attributes such action is a revolutionary Government which took power in September . In examining the various allegations submitted it is therefore necessary to have regard to the political situation through which the country was passing and to the political aspect of the governmental actions complained of. In many previous cases', in which it had to examine allegations against countries which were in a state of political crisis or had just passed through grave disturbances (civil war, revolution, etc.), the Committee considered it necessary, when examining the various measures taken by the governments, including some against trade union organisations, to have regard to such exceptional circumstances when examining the merits of the allegations. It is common knowledge that Argentina has passed through a revolutionary period and that the normal operation of its institutions has not yet been fully re-established. The various allegations made by the Latin American Confederation of Workers should, therefore, be considered in the light of the above facts.Allegations relating to the Detention of Trade Unionists and Workers
.Most of the allegations submitted by the complaining organisation refer to the arrest of trade unionists and workers. It appears from the Government's reply that, on  November , only  of the hundreds of persons mentioned by the complaining organisation were still in the hands of the Government. According to the Government's later reply dated  February  only seven of these  persons then remained in custody, three having been released and one having chosen to exercise his right to leave the country. The Government is considering the cases of those still detained. In the view of the Government, since the arrest of these persons was ordered by an agent of the authority specified in the Constitution, the guarantee of due legal process has been respected. The Executive has confined itself to applying a preventive security measure and not a punishment, and those arrested can halt this security measure immediately by observing the Constitutional procedure, which gives them the option of leaving Argentine territory, an option exercised by one of those concerned. The Minister of the Interior declared on  February  that the persons detained were not arrested by reason of their political opinions but were arrested only in proven cases of subversion or sabotage seriously endangering social peace. Further, the Government states that it has been unable to find any trace of the alleged tortures. In any case the appropriate criminal proceedings have not been instituted before the courts in which relatives of the persons concerned may institute proceedings with respect to matters of this kind.
.In the many cases in which the Committee has had to examine allegations regarding enforcement of measures of a strictly political character, such as martial law, it has always required the information submitted by governments to be sufficiently precise and circumstantial enough to enable it to conclude that the arrests were in no way occasioned by trade union activities. In the present case the Argentine Government has made a full inquiry into the position and supplied the Committee with detailed information, including particulars of the dates of release of  persons, and a list of  persons who have not been sufficiently clearly identified by the complainant to make possible full inquiries concerning them and in respect of whom the Government has no record of their having been detained.
.The question of the justification for introducing emergency measures, such as martial law or the like, is one which lies outside the competence of the Committee except in so far as it may have effect on the exercise of trade union rights.
.The Government states that the arrests of the seven persons who are still in prison were ordered with scrupulous respect for the Constitutional safeguard of due process of law : it was not strictly a case of imposing penalties, but rather of provisional security action to which the persons concerned can put an end at any time by making use of their rights under article  of the Constitution. The Supreme Constitutional Court of Argentina has declared this kind of restriction on individual liberties to be legitimate during a state of emergency. Furthermore, the arrested persons have administrative and judicial procedures for their defence ; and although, as the complainant organisation itself indicates, the courts in certain cases did not allow the writs of habeas corpus (see paragraph  above), this itself implies recognition that each of the persons concerned is in a position to defend himself under normal judicial procedure.
.The Government has confirmed that in every case the safeguard of due process of law was respected and that the supreme judicial authority of the country, which is independent of the Executive, confirmed the legality of the Government's action. What the Committee on Freedom of Association is concerned with is not, however, whether the action taken is legal under Argentine law, a matter on which the findings of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Argentina are clearly final, but whether the legal powers vested in the Argentine Government by the national law have been exercised in a manner inconsistent with freedom of association. The Committee has always emphasised the importance of due process in cases in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political character or with offences under the ordinary law and has taken the view that granting a trade unionist his freedom on condition of his leaving the country cannot be regarded as compatible with the free exercise of trade union rights. The requirement of due process would not appear to be fulfilled if under the national law the effect of a state of siege is that a court to which application is made for habeas corpus cannot make and does not make an examination of the merits of the case. The question in such a case is not whether the judiciary is independent but whether the law which it is called upon to apply is consistent with the principle of freedom of association and affords adequate guarantees of an independent and impartial examination of the merits of cases in which a trade unionist has been charged with a political offence. In all these circumstances the Committee, while recognising the exceptional character of the situation in Argentina and noting that only seven of the persons named by the complainant now remain under arrest, considers it appropriate to draw attention to the importance which it has always attached to the observance of due process in such cases, and to affording any such persons a fair trial on the merits of the charges on which they are detained.Allegations relating to Repression of the Trade Union Movement
.The complaining organisation alleges in general terms that there has been in Argentina a movement of repression against all trade union organisations. Some trade union meetings are said to have been prohibited and members of the armed forces are alleged to have been appointed to run the various trade union organisations, although these persons lack any representative character. The Government denies that any such repression occurred, since one of the objectives stated in the revolutionary Government's declaration of principles is precisely the re-establishment of freedom of association. In order to put an end to the administrative corruption prevalent in various trade union organisations, due to the venality of the leaders imposed by the dictatorship which had been overthrown, the Government was obliged to appoint persons to administer the General Confederation of Labour and the unions affiliated to it. The function of these persons was to guarantee free and honest elections in the said organisations within a reasonable period ( days from  May ). The Government states, in its communication dated  February , that elections have been held in the , trade unions and that , of these have already been handed over to their own administrations, and that all the trade union federations will have been convened before the end of March to elect administrations which will take over control. Then, declares the Government, the same measures will be taken in the case of the General Confederation of Labour.
.As regards the alleged repression of trade union activities and prohibition of trade union meetings, it should be observed that these allegations are of general character and do not mention any specific case of prohibition of meetings or other repressive action apart from those examined in the preceding paragraphs (arrests, etc.). It should also be pointed out that the statutory system of workers' organisation which the present Government introduced by Decree No.  of  May  (repealing the previous trade union legislation which had been the subject of observations by the present Committee), expressly guarantees the",1,1956,Argentina
422,"right of assembly without previous permission (section  of the Decree).
.As regards the appointment of persons to administer the General Confederation of Labour, the Government admits that this occurred and states that it was a measure rendered necessary by the corrupt administration of the unions whose officers had been appointed by the previous Government. The object of the said action was to make it possible for free elections to be held within a reasonable period. Intervention of this kind would appear incompatible with freedom of association in a normal period. It should be remembered, however, as pointed out in connection with the previous allegations, that this step was of a provisional character and taken by a revolutionary Government against trade union organisations which, in its view, were controlled by the Government recently overthrown. In Case No.  (Argentina) the Committee examined the situation arising out of this control of the General Confederation of Labour by the previous Government, and the Governing Body recommended the Argentine Government to reconsider the then existing law and practice. It would appear that the measures taken by the present Government were designed to implement the earlier recommendation of the Governing Body and that at the present time (February ) the object of the action taken by the Government is being achieved, primary trade union elections having been held and the administration of the unions in question having been handed over to the officers so elected, while preparations for similar elections in the case of the higher trade union organisations are now being made, after which they also will be handed over to their new administrations.
.In these circumstances the Committee considers that the intervention in the administration of the General Confederation of Labour and its affiliates, which the Government admits, was an exceptional measure of an entirely provisional character ordered during a period of transition towards a normal situation, which is being gradually re-established by means of free elections. The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to note that the return to a normal trade union situation is already well advanced and to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to re-establishing fully a situation in which workers without distinction may establish and freely join organisations of their own choosing. It also considers that the allegations regarding repression of trade union meetings are too vague to permit of an examination on their merits.Allegations relating to the Trade Union Press
.The complainant organisation alleges that publication of Unidad Sindical, Vocero, Lucha Obrera, El Federal, Derechos del Hombre, and other periodicals has been prohibited, and that persons selling Nuestra Palabra have been arrested. The Government, for its part, states that the restrictions imposed on the dailies mentioned by the complainant were based on the state of emergency which justifies, as the Supreme Court of Justice has admitted in several judgments, limitation for security reasons of the freedom of a certain section of the press "" directly subversive and hostile to the revolution ... following the directives of supporters of the fugitive ex-dictator "". The Government adds that the publication of the newspapers Vocero, Derechos del Hombre, El Federal (organ of the former Government Party) and Lucha Obrera (organ of the National Revolutionary Socialist Party allied with the former Government Party) was suspended because they engaged in subversive propaganda in favour of the rgime abolished by the revolution. Apart from this, states the Government, publications enjoy complete liberty of opinion, liberty of expression has not been hindered, and public, political and trade union functions have taken place in all freedom, while the radio is freely used for political propaganda. The Government indicates that the restrictions imposed during the state of emergency are temporary and that the return of the country to a normal Constitutional situation by means of elections is due to take place in . The need to defend the objectives of a revolution sometimes involves, according to the Government, the imposition of a minimum of restrictions on individual rights, in accordance with express provisions of the Constitution.
.In earlier cases relating to freedom of the press, the Committee considered that it was not called upon to examine the questions relating to freedom of the press in general but that it was competent only to examine the questions relating specifically to trade union publications, because as it stated in Case No.  (United Kingdom-British Guiana) "" the right to express opinions through newspapers or publications is certainly an essential element in trade union rights "".
.In the present case, of the publications whose circulation was admittedly restricted by the Government, only the Unidad Sindical would seem from its name, in the absence of other information, to be a labour or occupational organ. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the complaining organisation has offered no proof that the circulation of trade union publications was hindered by the reason of their being trade union publications. It appears from the Government's explanations that the restrictions imposed (during a revolutionary period and a state of emergency) were not based on the trade union nature of the publications but only on their "" directly subversive "" character, and that the restrictions were limitations of the general freedom of the press imposed for ""reasons of a political character and not purposes of trade union repression. In these circumstances the Committee, while stressing the importance of freedom of the trade union press as an essential element in trade union rights, considers that the restrictions imposed by the Argentine revolutionary Government on certain publications during the period of emergency appear mainly to have been based on reasons of a general political character. While bearing in mind the exceptional character of these measures, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of ensuring respect for the freedom of trade union publications.
.In conclusion the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its satisfaction at the measures taken by the Government with a view to restoring fully freedom of association and to ensuring full observance of trade union rights ;(b) to draw the attention of the Argentine Government and trade unionists to the text of the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ) which states "". it is essential for the trade union movement in each country to preserve its freedom and independence so as to be in a position to carry forward its economic and social mission irrespective of political changes "" ; when trade unions decide to initiate legally permitted political action they must ensure that such action is not "" of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of the trade union movement or its social and economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country "" ; it states further : "" Governments in seeking the co-operation of trade unions to carry out their economic and social policies should recognise that the value of this co-operation rests to a large extent on the freedom and independence of the trade union movement as an essential factor in promoting social advancement and should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party "" ;(c) to note the assurances given by the Government that persons are being held in preventive detention only in proven cases of subversion or sabotage and that the cases of those persons who are still detained are being considered, and to emphasise the importance of ensuring that every detained person shall enjoy the full guarantee of due legal process, so that an independent judicial authority can within a reasonable period carry out an objective examination of the merits of the charges on which he is detained ;(d) to note that the appointment by the Government of persons to administer the affairs of the General Confederation of Labour was an emergency measure taken after a revolution for the purpose of enabling organisations which had been controlled by the preceding Government to hold free elections, to note that such elections have now been virtually completed and that the return to a normal trade union situation is already well advanced, and to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to re-establishing fully a situation in which workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation, in which workers' and employers' organisations have the right to draw up their Constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and in which the public authorities refrain from any interference which could restrict this right or impede the careful exercise thereof ;(e) to emphasise, with respect to the allegations relating to freedom of the press,",-1,1956,Argentina
423,"the importance which it attaches to the principle of the freedom of trade union publications, as an element in trade union rights, and to the application of the principle.",4,1956,Argentina
424,".The following complaints were before the Committee : a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions, dated  December , together with a supplementary letter dated  February  ; a communication from the Metal Trades Workers' Federation (C.G.T, France), dated  January  ; and a communication dated  February  from the Metal Trades Workers' Union of the Democratic Republic of Germany. These complaints were communicated to the Argentine Government. To these complaints must be added several other communications drawn up in similar terms, some, dated  and  February and  April , emanating from the Free Trade Union Confederation of the Democratic Republic of Germany, and the rest, dated  March , presented by the National Trade Union for the Metal Trades of Hungary. These communications, which added no new elements to the complaints previously mentioned, were accordingly not transmitted to the Argentine Government. As all these different complaints relate to identical or related questions, they may conveniently be examined together. The complainants make the following allegations.
.A Spanish worker, Bautista Nuez, was expelled by the Argentine Government because of his political and occupational activities, and placed by force on a boat sailing to a Spanish port in order to be handed over to the authorities in that country. The World Federation of Trade Unions declared subsequently, however, that the person concerned had been put ashore in Brazil.
.In the course of May and June  the Argentine Government, with the aid of the police, repressed a strike of metal workers who were struggling for better living conditions, and made numerous arrests. In this way, the Argentine Government infringed the trade union rights of the workers.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its communication dated  April , the Government presented its observations with respect to the second allegation (paragraph  above), with the reservation that further supplementary information would be sent later.
.Not having ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), , or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention (No. ), , the Argentine Government, referring to the opinion which it expressed in an earlier case, makes express reservations with respect to the competence of the Committee on Freedom of Association to consider questions which are not dealt with in a Convention ratified by the Argentine Republic. Desiring, however, to clarify the matter, the Government does not press this question, considering the ratification or non-ratification of a Convention as a matter of pure form.
.Before entering into the details of the matter, the Government declares that, while the State must guarantee the full exercise of trade union rights - a question which is no longer a matter for discussion in Argentina-and ensure that the decisions of a trade union organisation, adopted by a majority in accordance with its Constitution and rules, shall be respected, it must also protect the community against any act by an organisation which is contrary to public order or to law.
.The Government then explains the facts which are the subject of the complaints. During April  negotiations took place at the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare between the Metal Trade Workers' Union and the Argentine Metal Industries Federation. These negotiations failed, and the employees of the undertakings in the metal industry started a go-slow strike. On  April , the union formally decided to call a strike, which was to develop progressively. By  May, the strike was general throughout the metal trades industry. On  May, a collective agreement was signed before the labour authority and submitted for approval to an extraordinary congress of delegates from the various sections of the union. On  June , the matter was discussed by the assembly, but a section of those present opposed the ratification of the collective agreement and the discussions had to be suspended on several occasions. On  June, the general secretary of the union announced to the delegates that several sections had resumed work. On  June, on the occasion of a further meeting of the delegates, demonstrators tried to enter the room and, in the disturbance which followed, several persons were injured. When the meeting actually became riotous, the police were called in. When calm was restored, the general secretary announced that a decision had been taken to raise the strike as from  June. This decision was approved by the majority of the assembly. Those who opposed, however, demonstrated in the street, convened meetings and appointed a strike committee. These demonstrations continued for several days, but the police did not actively intervene, but simply limited themselves to maintaining order. But on  June, the day fixed for the resumption of work, a serious incident occurred when a group of workers forcibly attempted to prevent other workers from entering a factory. Two people were killed and several injured. Similar incidents took place at other spots. After these occurrences, the police arrested  persons, including elements who were not employed in the trade in question. Those detained were handed over to justice on charges of homicide and committing bodily harm, in accordance with articles  and  of the Penal Code. Order was quickly restored and normal work was resumed in all the undertakings of the Argentine metal trades. The Government concludes that these facts show clearly that the workers were freely able to make use of their rights and that, while the police arrested a number of persons, who, moreover, did not belong to the industry concerned in the dispute, it was not in order to break the strike but to protect the life of citizens. Accordingly, declares the Government, it cannot admit that these measures should be the subject of an examination, as the Government alone has sovereign responsibility to apply general legislation in its territory.
.Having regard to all the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that, subject to the observations contained in paragraphs  and  above, the case as a whole does not call for further examination.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Paul RAMADIER, Chairman.",-1,1954,Argentina
425,".By a letter dated  July  the World Federation of Trade Unions, at the request of the Argentine League for Human Rights, has brought the following case before the I.L.O.
.Thirty-one workers of Spanish, Italian, Yugoslav, Russian, Polish and other national origins, detained in the prison of Villa Devoto in Buenos Aires, are stated to be threatened with expulsion under the Argentine Act No. , the so-called "" Residence "" Act, by reason of their participation in the making of demands of an economic and social character.
.The application of the measure is claimed to involve particular hardship in the case of these persons who, although of foreign origin, have lived for many years in Argentina ; several of them would even be placed in serious danger if they had to return to their countries of origin which are at present subject to dictatorial rgimes.
.Act No. -the abrogation of which, it is contended, has been demanded in vain by trade union organisations in Argentina-is alleged to constitute a permanent threat to foreign workers who have emigrated to Argentina and who may take part in collective action. In view of the large number of immigrant workers, the Act could cause harm to Argentine labour in general.
.The author of the communication concludes that Act No.  is contrary to the spirit of the Declaration of Philadelphia and to international Conventions concerning migrant workers.
.The Director-General referred this case to the Committee prior to communicating the complaint to the Argentine Government.",-1,1952,Argentina
426,".The complaints, dating respectively from  to , may be grouped under the three following heads : (a) complaint concerning the maritime industry presented by the International Transportworkers' Federation ; (b) complaints concerning the railroad industry presented by the International Federation of Land and Air Transport Workers' Unions and other organisations ; (c) complaints concerning the trade union situation in general presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
.In view of the fact that these complaints relate to different questions, it is desirable to analyse them separately.Complaint concerning the Maritime Industry
.The complaint contains the following principal allegations.
.The Government has taken repressive measures against the General Confederation of Maritime and Allied Trade Unions (C.G.G.M.A.), whose leaders face arrest on the pretext that they act on instructions from the I.T.F, which the Government has described as a communist organisation. The C.G.G.M.A is the victim of the systematic hostility of the General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.), which organisation occupies a privileged position and is officially supported by the Government. In contradiction with the spirit of free trade unionism and with a statement made on  April  by President Pern to the effect that "" No Argentine trade union leader has been or ever will be subject to any pressure whatsoever to make him change his way of thinking as regards his organisation's requirements for the attainment of its high trade union aims "", the Minister of Labour declared ten days later that the C.G.G.M.A had no legal status, that it was not identified with the social policy pursued by the national Government, that its activities were disturbing in nature and were contrary to the national interest, and that its programme was inspired from abroad by reason of its affiliation with the International Transportworkers' Federation.
.The functioning of the bodies for negotiation successively established between  and  to settle labour disputes in the maritime industry-bodies on which the C.G.G.M.A was represented-was paralysed by the hostility of the C.G.T. In , a new joint committee was set up without any representatives of the C.G.G.M.A and in direct violation of an agreement signed with the Director of the Ministry of Transport in .
.Owing to the absence of machinery for negotiation, the C.G.G.M.A was obliged to resort to strike action in support of its claims. In one strike, the crew members who had participated in it having been dismissed by the company, an official of the Ministry of Transport called in representatives of the unions affiliated with the C.G.G.M.A and told them that the dismissed sailors would be reinstated if the unions repudiated the C.G.G.M.A. Such a condition, according to the complainants, is contrary, not only to the principle of freedom of association, but to the Argentine Constitution as well.
.Measures of personal victimisation were employed against the strikers, and the personal effects of those leaving the ships were retained.
.The C.G.G.M.A was subjected to a campaign of the vilest nature in the newspapers controlled by the Government.
.In conclusion, the complainant asks that the I.L.O investigate the observance of trade union rights in the Argentine Republic.Complaints concerning the Railroad Industry
.The various complaints submitted in this connection, being similar in substance, may be analysed together.
.The majority of them are limited to the making of general allegations to the effect that, following the railway workers' strikes which took place between November  and January  and in August , the Government took repressive measures in decreeing the mobilisation of the railway workers, in making mass dismissals, and in arresting a large number of railway workers.
.In the memorandum joined to his complaint, one of the complainants alleges that more than  railway workers were arrested, that they are detained in inhuman conditions, and that the majority of them are shortly to be tried before military courts. He protests against the statement of the Government that the railway workers, in striking without authorisation from the General Confederation of Labour and the Railway Workers' Union, violated the provisions of the Industrial Associations Act and took part in a strike which had been declared illegal by the Minister of Labour because, according to the explanatory preamble to the Mobilisation Decree of  January , it had been "" started and directed by persons unrepresentative of the railway workers "". Adducing a statement made by General Pern, the complainant declares that the strike was desired by almost all the railway workers who, as a result of the refusal of their official leaders to support their claims, themselves set up an "" Emergency Advisory Committee "" which was the only body representative of the railway workers, the official leadership of the Railway Workers' Union having lost the confidence of its members. The complainant claims that the strike was motivated by the material situation of the railway workers, which had become impossible, and by various anti-labour measures taken by the Government (appointment to administrative posts of generally incompetent political protgs, unjustified dismissals in violation of the Railway Workers' Code). The strike was started only after a period of two years, during which the railway workers vainly hoped for the satisfaction of their claims, and was wholeheartedly supported by the Argentine people. The strike was twice discontinued when the Government undertook to satisfy the workers' claims, thus implicitly recognising not only the justice of those claims but also the fact that the strike was definitely economic in character.
.The Decree of  January , which ordered the mobilisation of the railway workers, is a real wartime enactment which should not have been applied in time of peace and constitutes an annulment of the right to strike and a violation of the Argentine Constitution.
.A list-stated to be incomplete-was appended to this memorandum, containing  names of workers who were to be tried in connection with the railway workers' strike of November -January .
.In conclusion, the complainants request intervention with the Government to end the measures of repression, to achieve the reinstatement of the dismissed railway workers, to liberate the prisoners and to repeal the Railway Workers' Mobilisation Decree.Complaints concerning the Trade Union Situation in General
.A complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, dated  April , which takes up and summarises again a number of other complaints addressed earlier by the same complainants to the Economic and Social Council, groups under the four following heads the infringements of trade union rights alleged to have been committed by the Government of the Argentine Republic:(a) infringements of trade union rights by legislative action;(b) violation of the right to organise by administrative action;(c) infringement of the individual liberties of trade union members ;(d) violence employed by the authorities against workers in their character as trade union members.Infringements of Trade Union Rights by Legislative Action.The complainant alleges that trade union rights have been violated by legislative measures relating, first, to the right to organise and, secondly, to the right to strike.
.The complainant alleges that trade union rights have been violated by legislative measures relating, first, to the right to organise and, secondly, to the right to strike.
.Infringements of the right to organise. With regard to the alleged infringements of the right to organise, the complainant, referring especially to Articles  and  of a Decree of  October , maintains that its provisions "" open the way to arbitrary action since they empower the Minister of Labour to void, at any moment, the right of a workers' trade union to operate as such "".
.Infringements of the right to strike. With regard to the alleged infringements of the right to strike, the complainant alleges, first, that, by virtue of Articles , , and  of the Decree of  January  for the repression of crimes against the security of the State, all kinds of strikes could be prohibited, and, secondly, that by virtue of Articles  and  of the Decree of  October  respecting the suppression of espionage, sabotage and treason, a Government wishing to end a strike would be able to arrest and sentence to very severe penalties trade union leaders who had decided to resort to a strike for strictly occupational reasons.Violation of the Right to Organise by Administrative Action
.The complainant alleges that the General Confederation of Labour was established on  March  at a time when freedom of association existed in law and in fact. But, after the assumption of power by General Pern, the two largest national federations, the Railway Workers' Union, established in , and the Railway Workers' Brotherhood, established in , were placed under the immediate supervision of the military authorities. An administrator was imposed on both organisations, who decided on their disaffiliation from the C.G.T. Subsequently, the Government used these two national federations, as reorganised, in its coercive campaign against the C.G.T in order to establish the domination of the trade union movement as a whole by the State. The unions, once placed under supervision, reconstituted the C.G.T, following which, those unions which up to that time had been independent were obliged to affiliate with the new C.G.T controlled by",-1,1952,Argentina
427,"the Government and by it supplied with servile administrators who shortly made them inoffensive. The national occupational federations which opposed absorption into the new C.G.T were dissolved one after another or forcibly placed under the control of an administrator and by him reorganised. The same thing was done to the local branches of these federations and the identical fate befell the regional federations and the independent trade unions. By way of example of these interventions of the administration in violation of the right to organise, the complainant cites the appointment of administrators to head several unions of mariners. Although they were apparently nominated by the leaders of the C.G.T, they were, in fact, appointed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.Another example of the intervention of the Government in the life of trade union organisations is alleged to be given by the following occurrences which took place on the occasion of the last presidential electoral campaign. The Railway Workers' Brotherhood, together with the other unions, was invited to promise its unconditional support for the re-election of General Pern. Invoking its regulations, the Brotherhood refused and decided to raise the question in its annual assembly, which was to take place on  May . The authorities, fearing that the Railway Workers' Brotherhood, oldest trade union organisation in Argentina, following the example of other unions, would also declare itself opposed to the re-election of General Pern, ordered units of the army to occupy the premises of the Brotherhood a week before the general assembly. The order came from above and was executed with the complicity of the police. Numerous trade union members were arrested. The Brotherhood decided to resist, and set up a provisional committee charged with the reconstitution of a Brotherhood independent of Government control and with demanding the liberation of those of its members who had been imprisoned in connection with previous strikes. On  August  the Railway Workers' Brotherhood started a strike in spite of the Decree of  January  which ordered the mobilisation of the railway workers. The strike was suppressed by the police and hundreds of railway workers were arrested and maltreated in the police stations of Buenos Aires and on the premises of the police in the district of Azul, province of Buenos Aires.
.The Government continually intervenes in the life of the trade unions, supervises them and makes clear its intention of directing them.
.Among the most recent violations of freedom of association the complainant cites the seizure by armed troops, supported by police, on  November , of the furnishings and records of the secretariat of the Workers' Committee for Independent Trade Union Action (W.C.I.T.U.A.), of the Shoe Industry Trade Union and of the Graphic Arts Trade Union. These three trade union organisations had, since  December , been dissolved by order of the Bicameral Committee of the Argentine Congress.Infringement of the Individual Liberties of Trade Union Members
.The complainant alleges that, in violation of freedom of association and without respect for human rights as they are defined in the Declaration of Human Rights which was adopted with the support of Argentina by the Assembly of the United Nations in , arbitrary arrests of trade union members, prolonged detentions without trial, torture and other ill-treatment by the police, banishment from the country by simple administrative decision, compulsory domiciling away from the ordinary residence and other acts of violence were employed against a very large number of trade union members.
.Two hundred workers were arrested for so-called violation of the Decree of  January  respecting the security of the State at the time of the railway workers' strike in January . They were imprisoned without trial for many months.
.In support of the allegation, the complainant cites the names of several arrested persons particularly well-known in the trade union world. They were all held incommunicado for two weeks, then tried for "" illegal association "" and violation of the Decree respecting the security of the State mentioned above. In reality, the charge of "" illegal association"" was, quite obviously trumped up for the occasion, for up to the time of their arrest the prisoners were officially recognised as representatives of the Railway Workers' Provisional Committee, and it was with them that the Government negotiated. A number of detainees were conditionally freed, but many trade unionists had to flee the country to escape certain arrest.
.Finally, the complainant alleges that several members of the Railway Workers' Brotherhood, whose names are given, were arrested on the occasion of the strike of  August  and are still detained.Violence employed by the Authorities against Workers in their Character as Trade Union Members
.The complainant alleges that the Minister of Labour and Social Security employed every means to prevent strikes from taking place. He succeeded in doing so from  to . Since that time, however, strikes were started in several industries to obtain better working or living conditions, or also for the defence of trade union rights or of the right to elect trade union leaders. The Minister of Labour, having been unable to prevent the strikes from taking place, attempted to win the leaders of the strikes to his side by corruption or otherwise. Being unsuccessful, he inflicted the most cruel ill-treatment on them, adding violence and torture to imprisonment, resulting, in some cases, in death.
.The complainant cites several examples in support of the allegation, including the case of Mr. Cipriano Reyes, Member of Parliament, stated to have been imprisoned without trial for two years for having demanded the restoration of trade union freedom.
.In its letters of  December ,  April  and  September , the Government first presents a number of general observations and then refers in more detail to the allegations concerning the maritime industry, the railroad industry and the trade union situation in general.General Observations
.Recalling the opinion expressed by the Employers' member of the Officers of the Governing Body to the effect that "" the only obligation which Governments have expressly undertaken entitling us to question their action is where they have ratified a Convention and are said not to be carrying it out "", which opinion is in agreement with that upheld by the Argentine delegate in the Economic and Social Council in , when the question of violation of trade union rights was discussed, the Government states that since it has not ratified the Convention on freedom of association it makes the most express reservations as to the competence of the I.L.O to examine a question of exclusively internal character which has already been settled in a satisfactory manner by means of absolutely legal procedures.
.The Government next states that freedom of association is absolute in the Argentine Republic, that it is regulated by legal rules which are not only prescribed in special regulations establishing the legal status of occupational associations but which are also contained in the Constitutional law which guarantees the rights of the worker. It states that it fully supports trade union rights and that they have been adopted as fundamental principles of the doctrine of "" justicialism "", and that the policy followed by the Government in this connection won for it an overwhelming majority at the last elections. For these reasons the Government considers that the complaints are motivated by exclusively political considerations, that they are lacking in proof since the complainants have not been able, nor will be able, to furnish any, and that they should not be taken into consideration.Allegations concerning the Maritime Industry
.The good faith of the International Transportworkers' Federation has been abused and the Federation has served as an instrument of the C.G.G.M.A, which organisation is almost entirely controlled by communist elements.
.The Government makes no observations respecting the attitude of the C.G.T towards the C.G.G.M.A and respecting the attitude of the press, in view of the fact that these two questions in no way engage the responsibility of the Government.
.As concerns the operation of the bodies for negotiation, it is incorrect to say that negotiations cannot achieve any result, since any representative workers' organisation may at any time negotiate directly with employers in respect of working conditions without any need for the intervention of the State ; if the employers refuse to negotiate, an organisation may appeal to the Industrial Relations Council to declare the existence of an "" unfair practice "", which procedure makes it possible to surmount the obstacles which may in practice be encountered in negotiations. In view of these provisions, the Government considers that it is unnecessary to comment on the attitude of the officials which was brought into question in this connection in the complaint.
.With respect to the strike in the maritime industry, it was justifiable to declare it illegal since it was started in violation of the regulations concerning the exercise of the right to strike, which provide that collective demands must be made in writing and that no change may be made in the existing situation while negotiations are in progress.
.The Government considers it unnecessary to take into",-1,1952,Argentina
428,"consideration the allegations concerning the attitude of an official of the Ministry of Transport during the strike and concerning the victimisation of strikers, in view of the vague and imprecise character of these allegations.
.Finally, it states that no one is either detained or under charges consequent upon the disputes in the maritime industry.Allegations concerning the Railroad Industry
.The intervention of the Minister of Labour in the dispute in the railway industry, both as concerns mediation and the declaration of legality or illegality of the strike, was made in conformity with the legal provisions in force. The strike was declared illegal in accordance with the opinions held on the matter both by jurisprudence and legal doctrine. The establishment of an emergency committee endangered the rights of the workers and the stability of the institutions recognised by Argentine public law. This is a matter of internal law which falls exclusively within the competence of natural judges who will be called upon to apply the penal sanctions should such be pronounced. With respect to the list of names which was joined to the complaint, the Government declares that only five persons have been proceeded against for misdemeanours under ordinary law and by virtue of a warrant for preventive detention issued by the competent judge and confirmed by the Appeals Court. The strike having been declared illegal for the reason that the workers' claims were under consideration, the Mobilisation Decree constituted a normal measure which has also been adopted in other countries where the national economy was seriously endangered and in view of the characteristics of the public services.Allegations relating to the Trade Union Situation in General
.In its letter dated  September , the Government declares that the complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions refers in substance to allegations contained in earlier complaints and that, consequently, it seems unnecessary to examine it with a view to making further observations. However, out of deference to the Committee on Freedom of Association, the Government makes a number of supplementary observations which are summarised below.
.The Government maintains that the complainant, in referring to Article  of Act No. , which regulates the activities of occupational associations, has incompletely quoted the text with the obvious intention of abusing the good faith of the I.L.O. In its reply, the Government quotes the whole text of the Article and claims that the allegation, therefore, is erroneous and tendentious.
.It is on the basis of the incomplete quotation of Article  that the complainant has been able to allege that () "" this text can mean almost anything in the hands of a dictatorial Government "", and () that trade union rights have been totally suppressed in Argentina.
.With regard to these last two allegations the Government wishes to bring the following elements of appreciation to the notice of the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.With regard to the so-called "" dictatorial Government "", it states that the triumph of General Pern in the elections of  was gained as the result of entirely free elections, the regularity of which was recognised both by the five political parties in opposition and by foreign observers. The same was true of the last elections (subsequent to the presentation of the complaints), in the course of which the Presidential mandate of General Pern was renewed a second time by a considerably increased majority. This affords irrefutable proof that the present Government of the Argentine Republic is the expression of the will of the great majority of the Argentine people which has thus demonstrated its gratitude to a Government which "" has made of Argentina a country of social justice, economic liberty and political sovereignty "".
.With regard to the allegation concerning "" the total suppression of trade union rights "", its lack of foundation is apparent from the fact that the complainant has given only an incomplete citation of Article  and has referred, out of their context, to Articles of other enactments which have no connection with the matter in question.
.With regard to the allegation that, in the Argentine Republic, only unions affiliated to the C.G.T have the right to conclude legally recognised collective agreements, the Government declares that it has never made any distinction in this connection between trade unions affiliated to the C.G.T and independent trade unions. It points out that the organ of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security responsible for registering collective agreements and for co-operating in the settlement of disputes between employers and workers has always exercised the greatest impartiality, in conformity with the legal principles governing labour matters.
.In support of its statement the Government gives a list of collective agreements to which independent organisations not affiliated to the C.G.T are stated to have been parties and some of which were concluded thanks to the intervention of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.From the foregoing the Government concludes that the autonomous or independent organisations enjoy, within the limits of the law, full freedom of organisation, functioning and action with regard to the defence of their occupational interests. They are, moreover, entirely free to conclude legally recognised collective agreements.
.With regard to Act No.  for the suppression of espionage, sabotage and treason, and Decree No. / for the repression of crimes against the security of the State, the Government maintains that these enactments have no relation to the right to organise or to the lawful exercise of the right to strike. The Articles on which the complainant's case is based relate exclusively to acts of espionage, sabotage, etc., which are repressed in every democratic country whose Government desires to safeguard public order. The Government adds that the necessity to apply these Articles has never arisen.
.With regard to the case of Mr. Cipriano Reyes, the Government maintains that he was convicted by the civil courts of the country of participation in a conspiracy both revolutionary and political and not on the grounds of his political and trade union activities.
.It is apparent from the analysis that several of the complaints, although emanating from different sources, deal with similar questions, while others, although emanating from the same complainant, deal with questions which are widely different.
.The Government, for its part, in its three communications, first raises certain prejudicial questions before presenting its observations on the substance of the complaints transmitted to it.
.In these circumstances, it has appeared necessary to group the allegations and observations together according to their subject matter.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:",-1,1952,Argentina
