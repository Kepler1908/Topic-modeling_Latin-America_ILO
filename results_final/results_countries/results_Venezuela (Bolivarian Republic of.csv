0,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  from the National Socialist Union of Workers in Fishing, Aquaculture and Related Activities (SINSTRAPESCAVE).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September and  November  and  January .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organization denounces the arbitrary detention and subsequent irregular criminal prosecution and imprisonment of Mr Daro Salcedo, organization secretary of SINSTRAPESCAVE, as retaliation for formulating a just complaint against the employer.
.SINSTRAPESCAVE alleges that: (i) on the morning of  May , officials from the Computer Crime Investigation Division of the Investigative and Criminal Police Corps (CICPC), without a warrant, raided the home in Caracas of Mr Daro Salcedo, a worker at the Socialist Fisheries and Aquaculture Institute (INSOPESCA) (hereinafter the public employer) and organization secretary of SINSTRAPESCAVE; (ii) they seized a computer and two mobile telephones from his home and they took him to the headquarters of the CICPC, where the Computer Crime Investigation Division operates; (iii) there they informed his family members that the president of the public employer and the director of human resources had lodged a complaint against the trade union official in respect of a Twitter message; (iv) a few weeks previously, on  April, Mr Salcedo had reacted from his Twitter account to a message published by another user, in which he said that the current Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture would be unable to live without his privileges and in the conditions in which workers survive; (v) the reference to the Minister was due to the fact that he had allegedly said that the insufficient food provided in the CLAP boxes (Local Supply and Production Committees) should last them at least three months (the Minister had said that  we have to stretch it out, eat enough to sustain us and make it last until the next box comes' ; and (vi) also, Mr Salcedo had sent a WhatsApp audio message to the director of human resources of the public employer, in which he strongly complained about the exorbitant increase in the price of a bag of food that is sold to the Institute s workers, which was to rise from , Venezuelan bolivars (US$.) to ,, bolivars (US$.), in a country where the minimum wage is approximately US$ per month, and with this bag containing just two packets of rice, two packets of sugar and two litres of oil.
.The complainant organization submits a copy of the judicial ruling of  May  handed down by the th Court of First Instance, acting as overseeing court for the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the Caracas metropolitan area, which gives as the grounds for the investigation messages from Mr Salcedo which, according to the judicial ruling, incited  mockery and hatred' against the presidents and directors-general of the People s Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture, by indicating that those persons were allegedly blatantly robbing workers as a result of the price of the bags of food and other benefits granted to them. In particular, the criminal complaint alleged that, in an audio message sent to a human resources WhatsApp group at the Ministry, Mr Salcedo stated  that the price of this bag is robbery, that they were thieves and that he was tired of workers being robbed of their benefits'  The ruling also indicates that it was established that Mr Salcedo produced several publications distributing comments and videos designed to promote hatred and action (although no details are given in the ruling as to the specific content of these publications that led to the initiation of criminal proceedings), action that is categorized and sanctioned in the Constitutional Law against Hatred, for Peaceful Coexistence and Tolerance, highlighting action aimed at inciting contempt in the population for the authorities that represent the State of Venezuela.
.With regard to the facts that subsequently occurred, the complainant organization indicates that: (i) on  May , Mr Salcedo was taken from his place of detention to the Palace of Justice for the preliminary hearing to be held before the th Court of First Instance, acting as overseeing court for the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the Caracas metropolitan area, but the court declined jurisdiction because the arrest warrant had been issued by the th Court; (ii) on  May , Mr Salcedo was again taken to the Palace of Justice, but the court in the case did not hand down a ruling; (iii) on  May , Mr Salcedo was transferred from the CICPC cells on Urdaneta Avenue to the CICPC s Arrest Division headquarters located on the El Rosal estate, where he is currently being held. The complainant trade union specifies that in that place there are highly dangerous prisoners and the inmates are so crammed into a tiny cell measuring  by  metres that they cannot all sit down at the same time, but must take turns and spend long hours standing up. SINSTRAPESCAVE indicates that in these horrible conditions of detention the physical and psychological integrity of the union s organization secretary is at serious risk, which is further aggravated by the pandemic and the disastrous sanitary conditions in the country; (iv) on  May , the preliminary hearing was finally held before the th Court of First Instance, acting as overseeing court for the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the Caracas metropolitan area, whose judge decided to indict Mr Salcedo for the offence of promotion of and incitement to hatred, established in section  of the Constitutional Law against Hatred, for Peaceful Coexistence and Tolerance, with a prison sentence of  to  years (this section establishes the following:  Section : Anyone who publicly or through any means suitable for public dissemination promotes, fosters or incites hatred, discrimination or violence against a person or a group of persons, by reason of their real or alleged membership of a determined social, ethnic, religious or political group, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or on any other discriminatory grounds shall be punished by imprisonment for  to  years, without prejudice to civil and disciplinary liability for the damage caused' ; and (v) the judge ordered the imprisonment of the trade union leader at the Detention Centre for Type II Defendants '  July' as if he were a public danger, located in San Juan de los Morros, Gurico state, some  kilometres from his home, in a country where economic hardship is compounded by a major petrol shortage, making it much more difficult for his family to travel from Caracas to San Juan de los Morros; moreover, this distancing meant that the official was completely cut off from his trade union (as an additional piece of information the complainant organization specifies that he has not yet been transferred to this prison centre due to an outbreak of tuberculosis there that has affected  inmates, as well as transport problems).
.The complainant organization indicates that although Mr Salcedo only has the status of defendant, in Venezuela this status is equivalent to a conviction owing to the slowness of the criminal process. Furthermore, SINSTRAPESCAVE denounces serious procedural irregularities: (i) Mr Salcedo s defence was not allowed to have access to the file and Mr Salcedo has been held incommunicado since he was again moved to his current place of imprisonment, on the El Rosal estate, following the hearing on  May. This is a violation of the right to due process; and (ii) the judge already had the decision in her hand during the hearing; it had been handed to her by the Auxiliary Prosecutor of the Eighth Prosecutor s Office (the prosecutor responsible for that office was not present at the proceedings, but did sign the documents).
.The complainant organization states that all the outrages that have been committed against Mr Salcedo for a simple trade union complaint (raiding his home, seizing his property, detaining him in subhuman conditions and subjecting him to a criminal trial that makes no sense and has no basis whatsoever, in the name of a law that is void, that in no way applies to him and with the prospect of a punishment that is out of all proportion) reflects the Government s viciousness in respect of freedom of association. The aim is to impose an exemplary punishment in order to instil fear in everyone and paralyse the action of trade unions and their officials.
.The complainant organization adds that, conversely, no measures have been adopted in the framework of Mr Salcedo s employment relationship: he has not been notified of any procedure to establish misconduct launched with the labour inspectorate nor of any internal administrative procedure, and neither has the payment of his wages been suspended.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government transmits the information received from the competent authorities in respect of the case. The Government states",0,2020,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
1,"that far from it being a case of arbitrary detention, due process was complied with and indicates that: (i) on  July , the th Court of First Instance, acting as overseeing court for the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the Caracas metropolitan area decreed release on conditional bail in favour of Mr Salcedo, in this way replacing the preventive detention that had been imposed on him; (ii) on  August , a preliminary hearing was scheduled for  August  (it had not been scheduled previously in accordance with the rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice, which stipulated, in the context of the pandemic and the state of alert throughout the territory, that criminal courts would continue to operate only for urgent cases in accordance with the Basic Code of Criminal Procedure); (iii) the preliminary hearing was deferred due to the failure of the parties to appear, with only the representatives of the Public Prosecutor s Office and of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic coming forward, and the prosecutor scheduling the date of  September  for the charge to be made; and (iv) on  September, the hearing was held, the accused admitted the facts and was handed a sentence of five years, with the release on conditional bail being revised in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Basic Code of Criminal Procedure, Nos  (regular appearance before the court or the authority designated by the court) and  (prohibition on leaving the country without authorization, the area in which the accused lives or an area determined by the court).
.The Government also indicates that Mr Salcedo is no longer working for the public employer as he handed in his resignation with effect from  July .
.In communications dated  November  and  January , the Government forwarded a copy of the court s ruling of  September  on Mr Salcedo s trial. The Committee notes from its contents that it is clear that: (i) the conviction based the sentence on the authorities' allegation that Mr Salcedo spread messages and audio messages, in particular via the WhatsApp network, claiming that high-ranking Venezuelan state officials are toying with the needs of the people by blatantly robbing workers as a result of the price of the bags of food and other benefits granted to them in times of pandemic, thus inciting mockery and hatred against those officials and against the President of the Republic; (ii) the ruling found that these posts by Mr Salcedo involve comments that are aimed at promoting hatred and destabilizing actions against the Government and therefore amounted to the offence of promoting or inciting hatred, as provided for and punished under section  of the Constitutional Law against Hatred, for Peaceful Coexistence and Tolerance; (iii) although the defence lawyer requested the dismissal of the proceedings against him, the accused admitted the charges and, given this admission, the minimum ten-year sentence was halved, in other words to a five-year sentence; and (iv) as requested by the Public Prosecutor s Office, it was agreed to uphold the revised release on conditional bail ' that is, instead of house arrest, an alternative measure of release on bail was agreed, involving regular appearances before the court every  days and a prohibition on leaving the country without authorization. Ancillary penalties to a prison sentence provided for in section  of the Criminal Code were also applied (consisting of  disqualification from political office for the duration of a sentence' and  subjection to supervision by the authorities for one fifth of the sentence term, once it has expired' .
.The Committee observes that the present case alleges the arbitrary detention and subsequent irregular criminal prosecution and imprisonment of Mr Daro Salcedo, organization secretary of SINSTRAPESCAVE. The Committee observes, on the one hand, that the facts that had allegedly motivated the detention, criminal prosecution and imprisonment of Mr Salcedo were carried out in the exercise of his freedom of expression as trade union official. On the other hand, the Committee notes that the ruling convicted Mr Salcedo on the grounds that it had been proven that he had spread messages and audio messages claiming that high-ranking Venezuelan state officials were blatantly robbing workers as a result of the price of the bags of food and other benefits granted to them, and that this incited mockery and hatred against those officials and against the President of the Republic. The Committee also notes that it was agreed that the five-year sentence would be served through the revised release on conditional bail, whereby he would have to appear before the court every  days and was prohibited from leaving the country, and that ancillary penalties to a prison sentence provided for in section  of the Criminal Code (disqualification from political office for the duration of a sentence and subjection to supervision by the authorities for one fifth of the sentence term, once it has expired) would also be applied.
.The Committee observes in this respect that the complainant alleges in the complaint, and the Government does not contest in its reply, that this relates to messages that Mr Salcedo allegedly sent from his Twitter and WhatsApp accounts denouncing the precarious situation of workers and criticizing the officials of the relevant Ministry. The Committee also observes that Mr Salcedo s critical remarks indicated in the initial judicial ruling of  May  to substantiate the opening of the criminal investigation (ruling submitted with the complaint), and in the conviction of  September  to substantiate the conviction, referred to the enjoyment of job-related benefits and were made in defence of the interests of workers.
.In this respect, the Committee wishes to emphasize the importance which it places on respect for the basic civil liberties of trade unionists and employers' organizations, including freedom of expression, as essential prerequisites to the full exercise of freedom of association. Accordingly, the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights; the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organizations must be based on respect for those civil liberties, such as security of the person and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention. Finally, the Committee wishes to emphasize that the detention of trade union leaders or members for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras ,  and ].
.The Committee considers that Mr Salcedo s criticisms on an issue of vital importance for workers (the price of the food bags and benefits granted to them) falls within the scope of freedom of expression in the exercise of their trade union freedom and should under no circumstances be subject to the imposition of criminal sanctions.
.Consequently the Committee, recalling the warnings and conclusions formulated by the Commission of Inquiry regarding other allegations of the use of criminal legislation to restrict the exercise of freedom of expression of trade union leaders and employers, expresses its deep concern that these messages by the trade union leader led to the initiation of criminal proceedings, his initial imprisonment and the handing down of a five-year sentence (having been subjected to release on conditional bail ' first house arrest and, after sentencing, regular court appearances and a prohibition on leaving the country without authorization). In the light of the foregoing, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to annul any punishment or restriction, including alternative measures and ancillary penalties, imposed on Mr Salcedo for exercising his freedom of association.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the legislative provisions invoked to arrest, prosecute and imprison Mr Salcedo are extremely indeterminate ( anyone who publicly or through any means suitable for public dissemination promotes, fosters or incites hatred  ? and carry very heavy sentences (of  to  years' imprisonment), and warns against their possible use, as the present case would attest, to restrict the exercise of freedom of association. The Committee urges the Government to submit to inclusive tripartite consultation the revision of the Constitutional Law against Hatred, for Peaceful Coexistence and Tolerance, in order to ensure that it cannot be used to restrict the exercise of freedom of association. The Committee, recalling the warnings and conclusions formulated by the Commission of Inquiry, requests the Government to keep it informed of all measures taken to this end and invites the Government to seek the technical assistance of the ILO in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to annul any punishment or restriction, including alternative measures and ancillary penalties, imposed on Mr Salcedo for exercising his freedom of association.(b)	The Committee urges the Government to submit to inclusive tripartite consultation the revision of the Constitutional Law against Hatred, for Peaceful Coexistence and Tolerance, in order to ensure that it cannot be used to restrict the",0,2020,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

3,".The complaint is contained in a communication of  December  from the Trade Union of the Ministry of Popular Power for Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (SUNOFUTRAJUP-MPPRE).
.The Government sent its observations by a communication of  September .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the complainant organization alleges anti-union persecution of trade union leaders and obstruction of an election process and collective bargaining. In this regard it states that: (i) the Ministry of Popular Power for Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela declined to hold discussions with the traditional unions of the Ministry, alleging electoral abeyance (those unions had been unable to elect new executive committees as a result of the many requirements and obstacles imposed by the National Electoral Council); (ii) in particular, in , when the workers authorized the SUTRAB-MRE, SINTRA-MRE and SUNTRA-MRE trade unions to bargain collectively, as they had received no wage increases since  despite high inflation, the authorities of the Ministry denied them, arguing that those unions were in electoral abeyance (they had not elected new executive boards within the statutory time limits); (iii) after another attempt to bargain through a committee of delegates did not succeed in May , the workers met at an extraordinary general assembly on  March  and agreed to establish a new trade union ' the SUNOFUTRAJUP-MPPRE, with , members ' so as to be able to bargain collectively; (iv) the trade union was registered on  April  with an interim executive board for a period of twelve months; (v) during that period, a discussion of a new round of collective bargaining began, which lasted until  January  and was never approved by the Ministry of Labour (the non-approval meant that it was as if the agreement did not exist, as only some clauses were applied); (vi) it was not possible to hold elections, as the elections were challenged by two workers, one of whom was not a union member, and the National Electoral Council ruled that the challenge was well founded; and (vii) as the election of the executive board was impeded, the new trade union found itself in the same situation of electoral abeyance ' preventing it from bargaining collectively ' that the Ministry had previously cited so as not to bargain with the unions referred to above.
.The complainant trade union adds that, as a result of this serious situation, the union launched a series of activities and protests ' given that the monthly wage was not even sufficient to cover the food basket for one week. The employer responded with a strategy of undermining the trade union: (i) two members of the SUNOFUTRAJUP MPPRE ' Ms Marie Borregales and Ms Ramona Caraballo ' were sent to the foreign service; (ii) a further two members ' Mr Luis Rondn and Ms Oramaica Espinoza ' had to leave the union; and (iii) the top three members of the executive board ' Mr Jos Patines Guanique, Mr Jess Serrano and Ms Besse Mouzo ' were threatened with dismissal, and proceedings to remove their union immunity were successively approved (for which the complainant submits the relevant documentation), resulting in their dismissal. The complainant rejects the Government s version of events alleging that this was an individual situation that affected only these three people, and emphasizes that it is an ongoing policy of denying freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.As for the case of Mr Jos Patines Guanique, General Secretary of the union, an application to remove his trade union immunity (and thereby remove his immunity from transfer or dismissal) and to dismiss him, which had been submitted by the Ministry to the Labour Inspectorate, was approved on  July . The Labour Inspectorate accepted the employer s argument that Mr Patines Guanique  shared images unrelated to trade union activities' on his personal Twitter account (despite the fact that they were actually of trade union activities, showing the General Secretary participating in a trade union event with representatives of the National Assembly demanding the restitution of the right to bargain collectively in the public administration) and  organized protest action'  which it characterizes as immoral conduct, slanderous allegations and serious misconduct. The complainant considers that this demonstrates that both the employer and the entity of the labour administration are attempting to have the workers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs persecuted ' and, in the case of the three leaders, dismissed ' for having protested and expressed their ideas and legitimate claims in public, and that the Government considers the exercise of freedom of expression and the right to protest ' in this instance, to demand better pay and working conditions ' to be immoral, slanderous and serious misconduct. Furthermore, the complainant reports that the Labour Inspectorate accepted the employer s challenge to the evidence submitted by the worker, which among other things demonstrates that he enjoys immunity from being transferred or dismissed on the grounds of parenthood as well as trade union immunity.
.As for the cases of Mr Jess Serrano and Ms Besse Mouzo, the Labour Inspectorate approved the applications for removal of union immunity submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the grounds of the same conduct previously denounced by the authorities. The Labour Inspectorate accepted the evidence tendered by the Government, dismissed the evidence tendered by the workers and removed the leaders' protection from dismissal or transfer resulting from their trade union immunity. For example, the evidence against Ms Mouzo consists of: a copy of an image of a public trade union event seeking humanitarian aid (exhibit ); a copy of a news portal in which it is reported that workers in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been victims of persecution for having demanded their rights (exhibit ); and a press release of  March  entitled  Workers in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to join staggered strike' 
.The complainant states that these three cases concern the same accusations and the same violation of freedom of thought and expression and of the right to protest, thus demonstrating how in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela the labour inspectorates do not defend the worker but instead functionally benefit the Government, having acted in this case as an ally of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The complainant therefore considers that the Government has free reign to violate freedom of association with the support of the Ministry of Labour and its inspectorates. The complaint ends by emphasizing that the issues raised are an expression of the problem indicated by the Commission of Inquiry, that is, that there exists a complex web that is hostile to and undermines the action of employers' and workers' organizations that are not close to the Government.
.In its communication of  September , the Government submits the information received from the competent authorities in relation to the case. As to the allegations concerning collective bargaining, the Government considers that they are related to the alleged application of Memorandum No.  of the Ministry of Popular Power for the Social Process of Labour. In this connection, the Government indicates that: (i) the content of said memorandum, which was unrelated to the structure and functioning of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, indicates the extraordinary corrective measures of the Recuperation, Growth and Economic Prosperity Plan, under which it was necessary to implement consensus-based (that is, agreed by workers and employers) bargaining strategies that were different from those that were usually developed; (ii) at no point were such guidelines ' which allowed sources of employment and jobs to be maintained' imposed unilaterally; rather, they were applied at the request of the parties; (iii) the provisions of the said memorandum were superseded by events, demonstrating that the workers' and employers' representatives had been engaging in collective bargaining; and (iv) in view of the concerns raised by some organizations about the memorandum, on  June  a new internal memorandum of guidelines was produced, to endorse the national labour policy on the discussion and signing of collective agreements, in the context of freedom of association and without any restrictions other than those established in national legislation.
.As to the alleged anti-union discrimination against the trade union leaders, the Government states that: (i) Mr Jos Patines Guanique, Mr Jess Serrano and Ms Besse Mouzo participated in public events, adopting a personal position and expressing their own opinions, without the agreement of the trade union organization of which they were members, acted contrary to the top representatives of the ministry employing them, against which it proffered insults and threats, as well as attempting through the use of force to disrupt work and impede workers' access to the facilities of the Ministry ' acting with solely political motives in the political context of the absurd proclamation of a so-called  interim president' who led them",0,2019,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
4,"to engage in conduct that is contrary to trade union ethics and any political activity under a democracy; (ii) these actions led the employing ministry to request the labour administration to characterize the offences committed by those workers, as they were protected by trade union immunity; (iii) the administrative proceedings to lift the immunity of Mr Jos Patines Guanique, Mr Jess Serrano and Ms Besse Mouzo were substantiated in accordance with the law, following due process, by the Labour Inspectorate, which reports to the Ministry of Popular Power for the Social Process of Labour; (iv) under the national legislation, and regardless of the fact that the workers' actions were unrelated to trade union activity, the protection afforded by trade union immunity means that a labour administrative authority, and not the employing ministry, must determine whether there is just cause ' a prerequisite for applying the disciplinary proceedings to two of the workers, who are career officials; and (v) as the workers disputed the arguments put forward by the employer, an evidentiary phase was opened.
.The administrative decisions of the Labour Inspectorate of the Ministry of Popular Power for the Social Process of Labour submitted by the Government set out reasons for the authorization of the dismissal of and lifting of trade union immunity from the trade unionists, after having established that they publicly (particularly through messages on the Twitter social network) condemned and disrespected their employer, and in the case of Mr Patines Guanique, called for a staggered strike in the Ministry. The Labour Inspectorate considered that this condemnation of and disrespect towards their employer showed a lack of integrity or immoral conduct at work, slanderous allegations or serious misconduct in relation to the respect and consideration owed to an employer, and serious misconduct in relation to the obligations imposed by the employment relationship. Furthermore, the Labour Inspectorate set aside all of the evidence tendered by the workers concerned, who had disputed and contradicted the allegations of the public employer that was seeking to have their union immunity lifted.
.The Government concludes by indicating that, after all legal formalities had been complied with, the Labour Inspectorate found the applications for lifting of trade union immunity to be substantiated. In the case of Mr Patines Guanique (whose dismissal the Labour Inspectorate also authorized), he was informed of the termination of his employment relationship, and in the cases of Mr Jess Serrano and Ms Besse Mouzo (career officials), disciplinary proceedings were initiated in accordance with the applicable law, the outcome of which was to remove their status of career officials.
.The Committee observes that this complaint refers to allegations of anti-union persecution of trade union leaders and obstruction of an electoral process and collective bargaining.
.As to the allegations of anti-union discrimination against the trade union leaders, the Committee notes that the Government contends that this is an individual situation that affects only three people who were not representing the trade union in the actions that led to their dismissal, that the actions constituted serious misconduct in breach of trade union ethics and any political activity in a democracy, and that they were not union-related actions but political actions. However, the Committee observes that the trade union denies that they were individual actions unrelated to trade union activities and argues that they were in the legitimate exercise of freedom of expression and the right to protest and that the dismissals are part of an ongoing policy of undermining freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.The Committee notes that the administrative decisions lifting trade union immunity, which were submitted by the Government to deny the existence of anti-union discrimination, consider as the key evidence to justify the lifting of these workers' union immunity the public condemnation of and disrespect towards the public employer. In this regard, the Committee observes that, while the complainant argues with specific examples that the evidence on which the Labour Inspectorate founded the decisions to lift immunity related to legitimate trade union activities (such as participating in action calling for the restitution of the right to bargain collectively in the public administration), the information submitted by the Government does not specify the purported content of the statements that the Labour Inspectorate considered to be condemnation of and disrespect towards the employer and that led to the dismissal of the trade union leaders.
.In the light of the above, the Committee observes with concern that the actions that purportedly justified the dismissal of the union leaders, Mr Jos Patines Guanique, Mr Jess Serrano and Ms Besse Mouzo, appear to be linked to the legitimate exercise of their freedom of association, through protesting and exercising their freedom of expression.
.In this regard, the Committee recalls that freedom of opinion and expression constitutes one of the basic civil liberties essential for the normal expression of trade union rights, that no person should be prejudiced by reason of legitimate trade union activities and that cases of anti-union discrimination should be dealt with promptly and effectively by the competent institutions [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ].
.In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to conduct an independent inquiry into the allegations raised in the complaint of anti-union discrimination against the union leaders, Mr Jos Patines Guanique, Mr Jess Serrano and Ms Besse Mouzo, with a view to ensuring due respect for their freedom of expression and to protest in the exercise of freedom of association. In the event that anti-union acts are established, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to reinstate and compensate the workers concerned and to keep the Committee informed of the outcome.
.As to the remaining issues raised by the complaint, the Committee notes that the Government provides information on the application of a memorandum on extraordinary measures to implement different bargaining strategies from those usually developed, and emphasizes that these provisions were superseded. However, the Committee observes that the Government does not respond to the allegations raised in the complaint of obstruction of an election process and of collective bargaining and the link to electoral abeyance. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the Commission of Inquiry in relation to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela examined this problem in general, as well as a number of specific cases raising similar allegations, and concluded that the institutions, rules and practices examined that were applied to trade union election processes were in violation of freedom of association as they are prejudicial to the independence that must be enjoyed by organizations in this regard, allow options close to the Government to be favoured and contribute to undermining the independent trade union movement and the capacity for action of both workers' organizations and employers and their organizations in their relations with workers' organizations. Consequently, the Commission of Inquiry recommended the elimination of electoral abeyance and the reform of the rules and procedures governing trade union elections, so that the intervention of the National Electoral Committee is really optional, does not constitute a mechanism for interference in the life of organizations, the pre-eminence of trade union independence is guaranteed in election processes and delays are avoided in the exercise of the rights and activities of employers' and workers' organizations.
.The Committee observes that the case raised in the complaint provides a further example of the serious problems identified by the Commission of Inquiry: as a result of difficulties in meeting the requirements of the regulation of electoral abeyance which was preventing the existing organizations from bargaining, the workers had to create a new trade union, which encountered problems in electing a new executive board and, as a result of delays in the process and the lack of approval of what was agreed by the authorities, it too was ultimately stripped of its right to bargain collectively. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee refers to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry concerning electoral abeyance and the rules and procedures governing trade union elections, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the development of collective bargaining between the Ministry of Popular Power for Foreign Affairs and the organization or organizations representing the workers in the Ministry.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to conduct an independent inquiry into the allegations of anti-union discrimination against the union leaders, Mr Jos Patines Guanique, Mr Jess Serrano and Ms Besse Mouzo, that were raised in the complaint, with a view to ensuring due respect for their freedom of expression and to protest in the exercise of freedom of association. In the event that anti-union acts are established, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to reinstate and compensate the workers concerned and to keep the Committee informed of the outcome.(b) The Committee refers to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry concerning electoral abeyance and the rules and procedures",1,2019,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

The Governing Body decided at its th Session (March ) that all allegations of the complaint concerning Convention No.  should be transmitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association for their examination.
.The complainant organizations presented additional information in communications dated  March ,  December ,  January ,  and  February  and  September . In addition, the National Union of Workers of Venezuela (UNETE) submitted additional allegations and information in communications dated  February . The National Federation of Labour Unions of Higher Education of Venezuela (FENASOESV) submitted further allegations by communication of  February .
.The Government sent its observations in various communications dated  September ,  January  and  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.UNETE denounces the killing of Mr Ramn Jimnez, general secretary of the Construction Union of Barinas State, on  April . UNETE also denounces acts of persecution by state security forces against Mr Reynaldo Daz, general secretary of the Union of Electricians and Allied Workers of the Capital District and Miranda State. UNETE further denounces acts of persecution and harassment and suspension of the payment of wages of Ms Norma Torres, administration and finance secretary of the Union of Electricians and Allied Workers of Carabobo State.
.UNETE alleges in its communication of  February  the anti-union dismissal of Mr Alejandro lvarez Aular, general secretary of the Union of Workers of the National Steel Enterprise (SIDERNAC), a union affiliated to UNETE. Specifically, UNETE reports that Mr lvarez Aular, in the exercise of his trade union functions, denounced to the Labour Inspectorate of Puerto Ordaz on  January  various violations of labour rights at a steel enterprise in the public sector in which he worked as plant protection supervisor, with  years of service. The complainants indicate that following the denunciation, managerial and supervisory staff of the public enterprise informed Mr lvarez that  on the instructions of the president of the enterprise ' he could no longer do his usual rounds of the enterprise installations ' involving contact with the workers'  The complainants indicate that doing these rounds of the enterprise installations were part of the trade union functions of Mr lvarez. Subsequently, the enterprise security staff instructed him to leave the plant, denied him entry and told him that he should not resist as officials from the Directorate-General of Military Counter-Intelligence (DGCIM) were on the enterprise premises and were hoping for some reaction from him so as to be able to arrest him. The complainants indicate that as follow-up Mr lvarez submitted a new official letter to the Labour Inspectorate of Puerto Ordaz on  January  to denounce the above-mentioned events.
.UNETE indicates that the same measure was applied on the following day to Mr Arjonio Farrera, who was also working at the enterprise and held the post of labour and complaints secretary of SIDERNAC. The complainants denounce the fact that  other workers were dismissed by the same public enterprise. The complainants allege that the above-mentioned acts not only violate the national legislation and international conventions relating to freedom of association but are also contrary to the decree published on  December  in Official Gazette No. ., protecting public and private workers against dismissal for a further two years. In this regard, UNETE alleges that the general secretary of SIDERNAC followed up on the above-mentioned events with the submission of official letters on  January  to: (i) the office of the Director-General of the DGCIM for the Guyana Region, in order to request a meeting with the union s executive committee to seek an explanation for the visits of DGCIM groups and armed units to the public steel enterprise; and (ii) the Labour Inspectorate of Puerto Ordaz, in order to denounce violations of the above-mentioned decree and other applicable legislation relating to protection against dismissal.
.By a communication of  September , UNETE alleges new acts of persecution and harassment against it, in particular the violent intrusion on  September  of four presumed DGCIM officials, one of whom was armed, to prevent the holding of a press conference attended by family members and lawyers of imprisoned workers. In this communication UNETE asked that several appendices sent to various authorities be considered as part of the complaint, namely: (i) a letter sent to the members of the Credentials Committee at the th Session of the International Labour Conference ( May ) to object to the delegation nominated by the Government; (ii) a letter to the ILO Director-General ( June ), which includes an account of the background to the social dialogue forum, as well as other events that occurred at the time of the forum; and (iii) a letter sent to the Deputy Minister for the Integrated Labour Inspection and Social Security System regarding consultation on special laws complementing or deriving from the Basic Act on Labour and Workers.
.UNETE alleges that the Government has been implementing a systematic policy of violations of freedom of association, including anti-union reprisals and violations of collective bargaining. UNETE adds that these allegations have been examined in the context of various complaints to the Committee (in particular Cases Nos , , , , , , , , ,  and ) and by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR).
.Furthermore, the CTV, on behalf of and representing the Single Union of Petroleum, Chemical and Allied Workers and Employees of the Autonomous Municipalities of Bruzual, Pealver, Bolvar, Libertad and Sotillo of Anzotegui State, alleges the arbitrary detention and irregular criminal prosecution of Mr Eudis Felipe Girot, executive director of the United Federation of Petroleum Workers (FUTPV). The CTV alleges that at  p.m. on  November  DGCIM officials arrested Mr Girot on the basis of an arrest warrant dated  November  issued by the Third Special Criminal Court of First Instance for Control Functions, which has competence to deal with crimes related to terrorism. The CTV alleges that Mr Girot was transferred to the headquarters of the DGCIM in Pozuelos in Sotillo Municipality in Anzotegui State and then to Caracas. The CTV alleges that Mr Girot was charged with the crimes of terrorism, association with organized crime (sections  and  of the Basic Act against organized crime and funding of terrorism), disclosure of confidential information and conspiracy (sections  and  of the Penal Code). The CTV adds that, at the corresponding hearing, the court dismissed the charges of disclosure of confidential information and conspiracy but upheld the charges of terrorism and association with organized crime, issuing a precautionary measure of  days in custody in Caracas.
.The CTV maintains that Mr Girot is a recognized trade union leader in the petroleum sector who has led two national protests demanding that benefits established by contract should be honoured and has received support from petroleum workers in other states. The CTV therefore alleges that the deprivation of freedom and criminal prosecution of Mr Girot stem from his complaints concerning workers' conditions of employment in the petroleum industry and the status of his employer. The CTV adds that the crimes with which Mr Girot has been charged are subject to penalties of imprisonment ranging from  to  years. The CTV points out that the report of the Commission of Inquiry established under article  of the ILO Constitution to examine the observance by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), indicates that trade unionists are being persecuted and prosecuted in the country, and the CTV quotes paragraph  of the report:  [T]he Commission considers that: (i) the bringing of criminal charges such as terrorism and treason against leaders of professional associations and trade unionists in relation to their trade union activities; [  and (iv) the continuation of criminal proceedings for years, with the imposition of probationary measures on the leaders, constitute serious violations of the civil liberties inherent to freedom of association and contribute greatly to the repression and hindering of that freedom, and confirm the perception examined earlier in the report that the exercise of trade union activities constitutes a high-risk activity in the country.' The CTV also asserts that the independent international fact-finding mission on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council (September , A/HRC//), highlighted the fact that criminal prosecution by judges and prosecutors without any independence whatsoever, and with the frequent intervention of intelligence agencies,",0,2016,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
7,"is a common pattern in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. In conclusion, the CTV claims that in the case of Mr Girot a pattern is being repeated, which was also examined by the Commission of Inquiry, of proceedings being held in a court far from the home of the accused, thereby exposing him to isolation from family and friends and depriving him of assistance, even in the form of food and medicine.
.SINTRAFERROMINERA, for its part, alleges the arbitrary detention since  June  and the prolonged criminal prosecution of Mr Rodney lvarez for participating in a workers' assembly. SINTRAFERROMINERA alleges that: (i) by the end of , Mr lvarez had still not been released; (ii) the ILO Director-General, the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Commission of Inquiry are aware of the situation of Mr lvarez; and (iii) the judicial proceedings were interrupted on several occasions, with the case being transferred to various destinations, resulting in delays to the proceedings. SINTRAFERROMINERA asks the Committee to request the Government to release Mr lvarez.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the killing of Mr Ramn Jimnez, general secretary of the Construction Union of Barinas State, the Government indicates that the relevant organizations have stated that the case is under investigation but that it cannot be inferred that his killing is related to his status of trade union leader, and so this is a baseless allegation.
.With regard to the allegations of persecution by state security forces of Mr Reynaldo Daz, general secretary of the Union of Electricians and Allied Workers of the Capital District and Miranda State, the Government denies that there has been any persecution. The Government asserts that Mr Daz has the full use and exercise of his legal and trade union powers and that there is no arrest warrant or investigation against him, and that he even participated in the negotiation of the collective agreement for the electricity sector. Moreover, with regard to similar allegations, including the suspension of the payment of wages, relating to Ms Norma Torres, administration and finance secretary of the Union of Electricians and Allied Workers of Carabobo State, the Government states that it consulted the enterprise which employs Ms Torres and indicates that: (i) Ms Torres did not appear for work for over nine months; (ii) under the collective agreement Ms Torres does not have indefinite union leave; (iii) she has refused to return to her job; and (iv) for the above reasons the payment of her wages has been suspended. The Government adds that an application for authorization of dismissal of Ms Torres is currently with the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and this has nothing to do with her union activities but with her repeated absenteeism. The Government asserts that there has been no harassment or persecution of Ms Torres.
.With regard to the allegations concerning criminal prosecution and imprisonment of trade unionists and workers for the exercise of their trade union rights, with some of these individuals remaining in prison for an indefinite period or under the obligation to appear at intervals before a criminal judge, the Government indicates that UNETE does not provide precise information. The Government adds that in previous cases before the Committee it has asked the Committee to require the complainants to provide a list of information containing their details and the trade union to which they belong, indicating the union activity for which proceedings are supposedly being conducted against them. Furthermore, with regard to the allegations concerning anti-union reprisals and the violation of the right to collective bargaining and freedom of association, the Government categorically denies the claim regarding the supposed application of judicial measures without duly substantiated grounds. The Government also indicates that: (i) peaceful protest is a constitutional right; (ii) it is the responsibility of the State to protect people, property and institutions against any illicit actions performed by third parties as part of a violent protest; (iii) the action of police and security forces is in accordance with the law; and (iv) the perpetration of illicit acts cannot be claimed to be the exercise of civil, political or labour rights.
.Lastly, the Government indicates in its communication of  October  that, according to its analysis, the case forms part of a series of cases brought before the Committee which are being examined individually. Two of these cases are active (Nos  and ), seven are at the follow-up stage (Nos , , , , ,  and ), and two have been closed (Nos  and ).
.The Committee notes that the present case was submitted on  June  in a complaint made under article  of the ILO Constitution by several delegates to the th Session () of the International Labour Conference. The Committee notes that the Governing Body decided at its th Session (March ) that all allegations of the complaint concerning Convention No.  should be referred to the Committee for their examination. The Committee observes that in the complaint the complainants denounce violations of public freedoms and civil liberties, dismissals of trade union leaders at a steel enterprise in the public sector, acts of persecution, intimidation and harassment against trade unionists and trade union leaders, and arbitrary detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists. The Committee observes that, as indicated by UNETE, some of the allegations made have already been examined by the Committee in the context of other cases. Moreover, the Committee observes that the Government has only supplied partial information in response to the allegations in the complaint, generally denying the allegations of persecution, intimidation and harassment as well as the other alleged violations of public freedoms and civil liberties, and further indicating the duplication of allegations in other cases which are active in the Committee, are being followed up or have been closed.
.The Committee notes the general allegations of UNETE that the Government has implemented a systematic policy of violations of freedom of association, also noting that UNETE lists a series of cases submitted to the Committee for examination. With regard to these general allegations, the Committee notes the Government s reply indicating that the allegations were being examined individually by the Committee, with two cases active (Nos  and ), seven at the follow-up stage (Nos , , , , ,  and ), and two closed (Nos  and ). In the light of the foregoing, the Committee will not re-examine allegations on which it has already given an opinion.
.The Committee notes that UNETE, in its communication dated  September , asks the Committee to consider as part of the complaint several appendices sent to various authorities, namely: (i) a letter sent to the members of the Credentials Committee at the th Session of the International Labour Conference ( May ) to object to the delegation nominated by the Government; (ii) a letter to the ILO Director-General ( June ), which includes an account of the background to the social dialogue forum, as well as other events that occurred at the time of the forum; and (iii) a letter sent to the Deputy Minister for the Integrated Labour Inspection and Social Security System regarding consultation on special laws complementing or deriving from the Basic Act on Labour and Workers. In this regard, the Committee observes that UNETE does not specify the allegations which it intends to submit in relation to the above-mentioned appendices, and so it invites this complainant to specify and provide details of its allegations relating to the appendices so that the Committee can undertake the relevant examination.
.The Committee notes with deep concern UNETE s allegation concerning the killing on  April  of Mr Ramn Jimnez, general secretary of the Construction Union of Barinas State. The Committee notes the information provided by the Government in this regard, indicating in general terms that the relevant organizations have stated that the case is under investigation, that it cannot be inferred that his killing is related to his status of trade union leader, and that this is therefore a baseless allegation. The Committee observes that this allegation was examined by the CEACR in its observations concerning the application of Convention No.  published in  and . Moreover, the Committee observes that this case was also examined by other ILO supervisory bodies as a result of the complaint made under article  of the ILO Constitution by several Employer delegates at the th Session of the International Labour Conference against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the decision of the Governing Body to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to examine this country s non-observance of Convention No. , among other Conventions. The Committee notes from the report of the Commission of Inquiry (published in ) that the latest information from the Government in this regard indicates that the case was under investigation in relation to the suspected crime of aggravated homicide (paras  and ).
.While observing that UNETE does not provide further details of the killing of Mr Jimnez, the Committee notes with concern",0,2016,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
8,"that from the time of the killing of Mr Jimnez in  until the time the Commission of Inquiry carried out its work, the case has apparently not yet been resolved. In this regard, the Committee recalls that the right to life is a fundamental prerequisite for the exercise of the rights contained in Convention No.  (ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee also recalls that the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee deeply deplores the killing of Mr Jimnez and urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the competent authorities: (i) give priority to the investigations under way and make every effort necessary to identify as quickly as possible the perpetrators and instigators of the killing of Mr Jimnez and ensure that the corresponding penalties are imposed on them; and (ii) take full account in the investigations of all relevant elements relating to the trade union activity of Mr Jimnez. The Committee requests the Government to provide information soon on progress made in this respect.
.The Committee notes the allegations made by UNETE concerning persecution, intimidation and harassment of trade union leaders. With regard to the alleged persecution by state security forces of Mr Reynaldo Daz, general secretary of the Union of Electricians and Allied Workers of the Capital District and Miranda State, the Committee notes that the Government denies that the alleged events occurred and asserts that Mr Daz has the full use and exercise of his legal and trade union powers and that there is no arrest warrant or investigation against him. The Committee also notes the allegations of persecution, harassment and suspension of the payment of wages of Ms Norma Torres, administration and finance secretary of the Union of Electricians and Allied Workers of Carabobo State. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s statement that there has not been any harassment or persecution and that it has forwarded the information provided by the enterprise employing Ms Torres, which indicates that: (i) it denies these allegations; (ii) Ms Torres did not appear for work for over nine months; (iii) Ms Torres does not have indefinite union leave and has refused to return to her job, and so if wages have been deducted, it is because of her absenteeism; and (iv) it applied for an authorization of dismissal to the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour; this has nothing to do with the union activities of Ms Torres but with her absenteeism. The Committee observes major divergences between the assertions contained in the complaint and the Government s reply with respect to the cases of Mr Daz and Ms Torres. In view of these divergences, the Committee invites UNETE to provide further details regarding the allegation of persecution and harassment of the above-mentioned trade union leaders so that this issue can be examined in full knowledge of the facts and, if this is not possible, to indicate whether there is any obstacle to providing this information; and it requests the Government to send further information regarding the procedure initiated with the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour against Ms Torres.
.The Committee notes UNETE s allegations regarding persecution and harassment that it faced on  September , denouncing the violent intrusion of four presumed officials of the DGCIM, one of them armed, with the intention of preventing a press conference attended by family members and lawyers of imprisoned workers. In this regard, the Committee recalls that freedom of opinion and expression and, in particular, the right not to be penalized for one s opinions, is an essential corollary of freedom of association, and workers, employers and their organizations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression in their meetings, publications and in the course of their trade union activities [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee also recalls that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Compilation, para. ]. Observing that the Government has still not responded to this allegation, the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations on this matter as quickly as possible.
.The Committee notes the allegations made by the CTV denouncing the arbitrary detention and irregular criminal prosecution of Mr Eudis Felipe Girot, executive director of the United Federation of Petroleum Workers of Venezuela (FUTPV). The Committee notes that the CTV alleges that: (i) at  p.m. on  November , DGCIM officials arrested Mr Girot on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by the Third Special Criminal Court of First Instance for Control Functions, which has competence to deal with crimes related to terrorism ( November ); (ii) further to the initial court hearing in Caracas, the court dismissed some of the charges but upheld the charges of terrorism and association with organized crime (sections  and  of the Basic Act against organized crime and funding of terrorism); (iii) the crimes to which the charges relate are subject to penalties of imprisonment ranging from  to  years; and (iv) the court issued a precautionary measure of  days in custody. The Committee notes the CTV s allegation that the detention is related to Mr Girot s activities as a trade union leader (he has led two national protests demanding that benefits established by contract should be honoured and has received support from petroleum workers in other states). The Committee notes that the Government has not provided its response to this allegation. However, the Committee observes that the CEACR, in its recent comment on the application of Convention No.  (published in ), noted the information received by the Government regarding the case of Mr Eudis Girot, including the fact that: (i) by means of a court judgment, Mr Girot was acquitted of the crime of disclosure of confidential information (section  of the Penal Code) and illicit possession of a firearm (section  of the Basic Act concerning disarmament and the control of arms and munitions); (ii) he was convicted of the crime of fomenting hatred (section  of the Penal Code) and sentenced to three years' imprisonment and in this regard the non-custodial precautionary measure was maintained; (iii) the proceedings are at the appeals stage and if the judgment is upheld, the competent court will impose alternative formulas for serving the sentence, in accordance with the Basic Code of Criminal Procedure. The Committee notes the CTV s indication that various international organizations have identified patterns with regard to persecution and prosecution of trade unionists in the country. The Committee notes the CTV s allegation that, in the case of Mr Girot, a pattern is being repeated of proceedings being held in a court far from the home of the accused, thereby exposing him to isolation from family and friends and depriving him of assistance, even in the form of food and medicine.
.The Committee duly notes these serious allegations and recalls that the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights; the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organizations must be based on respect for those civil liberties, such as security of the person and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention, and that measures designed to deprive trade union leaders and members of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association [see Compilation, paras  and ]. The Committee observes that, in a similar vein, the Commission of Inquiry appointed under article  of the ILO Constitution to examine the observance by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), Convention No.  and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), recommended: ' ii) cessation of the use of judicial proceedings and preventive and non-custodial measures, including the subjection of civilians to military jurisdiction, (' ; (iii) the immediate release of any employer or trade unionist who is imprisoned in relation to the exercise of the legitimate activities of their organizations  ?(report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ()(ii) and (iii)). The Committee urges the Government to provide detailed information on the situation of Mr Girot, and urges the Government to ensure that due process is respected in criminal proceedings against him, and",0,2016,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
9,"to guarantee that he has not been detained in relation to his activities as a trade union leader. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.The Committee notes the allegations of SINTRAFERROMINERA in the case of the arbitrary detention and prolonged criminal prosecution of the trade unionist Mr Rodney lvarez. In this regard, the Committee observes that the case of Mr lvarez was examined in depth by the above-mentioned Commission of Inquiry (paras ,  and '  of the report of the Commission of Inquiry), which in its report recommended the immediate release of Mr Rodney lvarez (para. ()(iii)). In follow-up to the Commission of Inquiry, the Committee notes that the CEACR in its most recent observation concerning the application of Convention No.  by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (published in ) noted the resolution of the criminal case, in view of the fact that the Eleventh Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas handed down its definitive judgment ordering the unrestricted freedom of Mr lvarez ( June ), and recalled the right to due sanction of, and compensation for, violations of civil liberties, and so it requested the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure fair compensation for the harm caused to Mr lvarez, including the appropriate financial compensation for injury suffered, in conformity with the Constitution. In the light of the foregoing, trusting that the competent authorities will grant fair compensation to Mr lvarez, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.The Committee notes UNETE s allegations concerning the anti-union dismissal of Mr Alejandro lvarez Aular, general secretary of SIDERNAC. The Committee notes that UNETE reports that on  January  Mr lvarez Aular had denounced violations of labour rights occurring at a steel enterprise in the public sector to the Labour Inspectorate of Puerto Ordaz. Moreover, the Committee notes that UNETE reports that, at the time of the dismissal, officials at the enterprise told him that he would not be able to do his rounds of the enterprise as part of his union activity and that he should not resist since officials from the Directorate-General of Military Counter-Intelligence (DGCIM) were on the enterprise premises, hoping for some reaction from him so as to be able to arrest him. The Committee notes that Mr lvarez Aular sent an official letter to the Labour Inspectorate denouncing the dismissal that allegedly occurred on  January . In this regard, the Committee recalls that in cases of the dismissal of trade unionists on the grounds of their trade union membership or activities, the Committee has requested the government to take the necessary measures to enable trade union leaders and members who had been dismissed due to their legitimate trade union activities to secure reinstatement in their jobs and to ensure the application against the enterprises concerned of the corresponding legal sanctions [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee notes that Mr Aular sent a number of official letters to the DGCIM to request a meeting and seek an explanation for the DGCIM presence at the enterprise, and to the Labour Inspectorate with regard to other dismissed workers, alleging violations of the national legislation. In the light of the foregoing and noting with regret the lack of any response from the Government, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that proceedings within the Labour Inspectorate in relation to Mr lvarez Aular are clarified as soon as possible and that the question is resolved regarding whether anti-union discrimination was committed by the enterprise in the dismissal of the aforementioned union leader and, if so, that appropriate penalties are imposed and compensation measures adopted, including reinstatement in his job. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on the other proceedings initiated by Mr Aular vis--vis the DGCIM and the Labour Inspectorate in relation to other dismissals, so that the Committee can examine these elements in full knowledge of the facts.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the dismissal of Mr Arjonio Farrera, labour and complaints secretary of SIDERNAC, and of  other workers at the public-sector steel enterprise, the Committee observes that it does not have further details regarding the anti-union nature of the alleged dismissals. It therefore invites the complainants to send more precise and detailed information in this regard, so that this issue can be examined in the light of all the relevant elements.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations as soon as possible on all the allegations to which it has not yet responded. The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee observes that UNETE does not specify the allegations which it intends to submit in relation to the accompanying appendices, which include letters to various institutions and organizations (national and international, including the ILO), and so it invites this complainant to specify and provide details of its allegations relating to the aforementioned appendices so that the Committee can undertake the relevant examination.(b) The Committee deeply deplores the killing of Mr Jimnez and urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the competent authorities: (i) give priority to the investigations under way and make every effort necessary to identify as quickly as possible the perpetrators and instigators of the killing of Mr Jimnez and ensure that the corresponding penalties are imposed on them; and (ii) take full account in the investigations of all relevant elements relating to the trade union activity of Mr Jimnez. The Committee requests the Government to provide information soon on progress made in this respect.(c) The Committee invites UNETE to provide further details regarding the allegation of persecution and harassment of the above-mentioned trade union leaders so that this issue can be examined in full knowledge of the facts and, if this is not possible, to indicate whether there is any obstacle to providing this information; and it requests the Government to send further information regarding the procedure initiated with the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour against Ms Torres.(d) The Committee observes that the Government has still not provided its response to the allegation of violent persecution and harassment of UNETE by four presumed officials of the DGCIM, one of them armed, with the intention of preventing a press conference ( September ). The Committee requests the Government to provide its observations in this respect as soon as possible.(e) The Committee urges the Government to provide detailed information on the situation of Mr Girot, and urges the Government to ensure that due process is respected in criminal proceedings against him, and to guarantee that he has not been detained in relation to his activities as a trade union leader. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.(f) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that proceedings within the Labour Inspectorate in relation to Mr lvarez Aular are clarified as soon as possible and that the question is resolved regarding whether anti-union discrimination was committed by the enterprise in the dismissal of the aforementioned union leader and, if so, that appropriate penalties are imposed and compensation measures adopted, including reinstatement in his job. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on the other proceedings initiated by Mr Aular vis--vis the DGCIM and the Labour Inspectorate in relation to other dismissals, so that the Committee can examine these elements in full knowledge of the facts.(g) The Committee observes that it does not have further details regarding the anti-union nature of the alleged dismissals of Mr Farrera and  other workers at the public-sector steel enterprise, and so it invites the complainants to send more precise and detailed information in this regard, so that this issue can be examined in the light of all the relevant elements.(h) The Committee requests the Government to provide its observations as soon as possible on all the allegations to which it has not yet responded.(i) The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the serious and urgent nature of this case.",0,2016,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
10,".The complaint is contained in communications dated  November  and  April  from the United Trade Union of Workers in the Steel and Allied Industries of the State of Bolvar (SUTISS) and the National Union of Workers of Venezuela (UNETE).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  November  and  April , the complainant organizations allege the persecution, detention and criminal prosecution of workers Mr Leinys Yeleida Quijada Jimnez, Mr Rederick Julia Leiba Guzmn and Mr Heberto Tadeo Bastardo Morao because of their participation in a workers' protest at the state-owned Orinoco steel corporation (SIDOR, hereinafter  the steel company'  over its failure to comply with the '  collective agreement.
.The complainants allege that: (i) the workers in question were initially targeted by the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) through activities such as surveillance of their family homes and the planting of weapons so as to bring charges against them; (ii) on  September , they were illegally detained after being falsely accused following an alleged anonymous complaint made to SEBIN; (iii) SEBIN claimed that it had found the workers in possession of a firearm, but the weapon had been planted by SEBIN, whose records refer to two anonymous witnesses who the defence was unable to verify; (iv) as a result of these actions, the three workers have remained in detention since  September ; (v) on  November  (two days after the established deadline), the Public Prosecutor s Office brought formal charges against the three workers as the co-perpetrators of the criminal offences of illicit trafficking in arms and criminal conspiracy; and (vi) the defence filed a number of actions and appeals to end their detention but these efforts were unsuccessful (on the date the complaint was filed, the outcome was still awaited of the appeal lodged with the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court of Justice against the Court of Appeal s ruling that the application for a writ of amparo to seek the release of the workers was inadmissible).
.In its communication dated  September , the Government provides its observations and refutes the complainants' allegations. The Government states that the workers Mr Leinys Yeleida Quijada Jimnez, Mr Rederick Julia Leiba Guzmn and Mr Heberto Tadeo Bastardo Morao have been released and have not been subjected to any form of persecution. The Government reports that, according to the judicial authorities, an investigation was conducted into the alleged commission of the criminal offences of illicit trafficking in firearms and criminal conspiracy, at the request of the Attorney-General s Office. However, the Government emphasizes that the judicial authorities confirmed that the citizens in question are not being held in detention.
.Furthermore, the Government has sent a communication signed by the three workers concerned, as well as by the organization secretary of their union (the complainant organization SUTISS), in which they: (i) deny that they were detained or persecuted for trade union activities by the Government; (ii) claim that they did not feel represented by the president of SUTISS (who signed the complaint) or by UNETE (the other complainant organization); (iii) consider the situation to be related to an intra-union dispute; and (iv) state that they do not wish this dispute to be considered by the Committee on Freedom of Association and request it not to pursue its examination of the complaint. The Government also reports that the steel company s president confirmed that the citizens concerned are workers in the company and that there is an internal dispute within their trade union (SUTISS). The Government considers that the case in question involves an intra-union dispute, in which the Government has not intervened in any way, fully complying with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). The Government therefore requests that, in line with previous decisions of the Committee relating to intra-union disputes, it does not pursue its examination of this case.
.The Committee observes that the complaint concerns allegations of anti-union discrimination involving the persecution, detention and criminal prosecution of three workers (Mr Leinys Yeleida Quijada Jimnez, Mr Rederick Julia Leiba Guzmn and Mr Heberto Tadeo Bastardo Morao) from the steel company. The Committee notes that, on the one hand, the complainants allege that the authorities detained these workers after they were falsely accused of criminal offences relating to the possession of weapons, in retaliation for their participation in a protest against the failure to comply with a collective agreement. On the other hand, the Committee notes that the Government states that, according to information from the judicial authorities, the workers concerned are not detained and were simply investigated for the alleged commission of criminal offences unrelated to trade union activities. In addition, the Committee notes the communication provided by the Government in which the workers concerned and an official of one of the complainant organizations deny that the trade union had been persecuted by the Government, state that they are not held in detention, consider that the complaint had arisen from an intra-union dispute, and request the Committee not to pursue its examination of the case.
.The Committee observes that, beyond stating that these workers participated in a protest against the failure to comply with a collective agreement, the complainants provide no further evidence of the alleged anti-union motives. Moreover, from the Government s reply and the statements of the workers affected submitted by the Government, these workers are not currently detained nor have been subjected to any form of persecution for their trade union activities and they do not support this complaint. On the understanding that none of the criminal proceedings referred to in the complaint are still ongoing and given that no additional information has been received from the complainants in the past two years, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
11,".The complaint is contained in communications dated  and  December ,  March,  and  July and  November  from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and the Federation of Chambers and Associations of Commerce and Production of Venezuela (FEDECAMARAS).
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  September .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications dated  and  December ,  March,  and  July and  November , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS presented the following allegations.
.The complainant organizations allege that the Government compelled Cervecera Polar CA (hereinafter, the enterprise) to engage in collective bargaining with a trade union with government ties that represents only a minority of the workers.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the enterprise (the country s leading producer and distributor of beer and malt beverages, a member of the Empresas Polar group and an affiliate of FEDECAMARAS) has customarily concluded collective agreements with the most representative trade union in the state of Carabobo (the location of the country s largest beer and malt beverage production plant) and extended the scope of those agreements by mutual consent to employees in the other federal states of the  central commercial zone' (Amazonas, Apure, Aragua, Bolvar, Cojedes, Falcn and Gurico). This has been the case on six occasions since .
.At the expiry of the '  collective agreement, the enterprise concluded another such agreement with the most representative trade union, the Single Union of Workers of the Beer, Soft Drink and Nutritional Beverage Industries of Carabobo State (SUTRABACARABOBO), which was registered by the competent administrative authority on  December . The complainant organizations denounce the fact that, at the time, the People s Ministry for the Social Process of Labour (hereinafter, MPPPST) rejected the (hitherto customary) extension of the agreement to workers in other states, arguing that the agreement with SUTRABACARABOBO could only be applied in the state of Carabobo, notwithstanding the trade union s most representative status in the other states. The complainant organizations allege that this occurred because the Government favours the Single Regional Workers' Union of the Polar Group Central Zone (SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR), another trade union which has ties with the governing United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and which instigated a separate bargaining process. According to the complainants' indications, in the states in question (in other words, elsewhere than in Carabobo), SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR only represents  per cent of all the workers concerned ' compared with the  per cent represented by SUTRABACARABOBO (and the complainants add that, outside those states, SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR represents only  per cent of all unionized workers employed by the enterprise). Consequently, the enterprise made it known to the competent authority that SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR was not the most representative organization and that, as was the custom, the collective agreement concluded with SUTRABACARABOBO should be applied. Nevertheless, the MPPPST failed to acknowledge the most representative status of SUTRABACARABOBO and obliged the enterprise to negotiate in relation to a draft agreement presented by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, disregarding all the evidence demonstrating that the latter organization was less representative.
.The complainant organizations substantiate their allegations of government interference in favour of SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR and to the detriment of SUTRABACARABOBO by reporting the following acts (referring to information available to the public through, for example, news media, social networks and PSUV communications): (i) the participation of SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR at press conferences organized by the PSUV and held at its headquarters, where the aforementioned union referred to the enterprise using insulting terms and in a party-political tone aiming to demonstrate that it enjoyed extensive government support; (ii) statements by PSUV representatives supporting SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR and insulting the enterprise; (iii) the support and favour of the Vice-President of the Republic in the form of a photo with the leaders of SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR; (iv) social network posts by the People s Minister for the Prison Service expressing support and favour for SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR; and (v) social network posts by the ombudsman expressing the favoured position of SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR and false and defamatory accusations against the enterprise.
.The complainant organizations allege that, in an attempt to coerce the enterprise into conducting collective negotiations in relation to its draft agreement, SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR engaged in various acts of violence between  April and  July  with the aim of halting production at certain distribution agencies, harming the enterprise s business and disrupting its operations: (i) on ,  and  April , a group of persons unconnected with the enterprise, supported and accompanied by the SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR president, gathered in the vicinity of the distribution agency in the town of Turmero in the state of Aragua, bearing firearms and obstructing normal workplace operations and worker access through the use of violence (according to the complainants, these facts were duly and promptly reported to the competent authorities and reflect the gravity of the arbitrary violence of criminal factions acting with impunity as a result of the inaction of the criminal prosecution authorities); and (ii) between  and  April , a group of persons unconnected with the enterprise once again gathered in the vicinity of the Turmero distribution agency, bearing firearms and obstructing normal workplace operations and worker access through the use of violence, further harming the enterprise s business (according to the complainants, these persons had been contacted by the executive committee of SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR and, since they lacked the support of most of the workers, who accepted the recent agreement with SUTRABACARABOBO, they resorted to the use of threats to win support for their efforts to cause a work stoppage). The complainants indicate that these acts of violence were roundly condemned by the workers of the Turmero agency.
.The complainant organizations further denounce the repeated threats and verbal attacks by the SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR president, at press conferences, interviews and even PSUV rallies, against the enterprise, the corporate group, its workers and shareholders and its chairman. These false and unbecoming accusations aimed to denigrate and to incite harmful aggression and were later broadcast repeatedly and extensively on state television channels. The complainants submit detailed information about these events and allege that they form part of a government-backed campaign to harm the corporate group, its workers and shareholders, and in particular the enterprise, its chairman and the corporate group, through work stoppages and criminal acts.
.The complainant organizations denounce the fact that, on  June , the director of the national labour inspectorate, which is attached to the MPPPST, issued a report indicating the impossibility of reaching an agreement and, after more than  days since the start of the strike, recommended that the People s Minister for Labour refer the dispute to arbitration, which the Minister did through Decision No.  of  July . The complainants recall that no legal standard provides for such recourse in the event that a strike, such as that initiated by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, paralyses operations in the beer and malt beverage distribution sector (which is not an essential service) and highlight the fact that section  of the Basic Act on Labour and Men and Women Workers (LOTTT) stipulates that a collective labour dispute can only be referred to compulsory arbitration where the strike poses an immediate threat to the lives or safety of the whole or part of the population. The complainants emphasize that it was inconceivable that this strike could endanger the lives or safety of the population and so the dispute should never have been submitted to compulsory arbitration; this constituted a gross violation of the right to voluntary collective bargaining. They further denounce the fact that, without impartiality, due process or the right of defence, and under the control of the Ministry of Labour: (i) Decision No.  portrayed the enterprise, in a biased and unfounded manner, as being opposed to dialogue, describing its chairman as stubborn and turning the workers against it, instead of creating conditions that were conducive to settling the dispute; (ii) the arbitration proceedings were held at the Office of the Ombudsman, a body whose mandate does not extend to labour relations and whose most senior figure publicly expressed opposition to the enterprise; (iii) throughout the arbitration proceedings, the presiding arbitrator (imposed by the Ministry of Labour) and the arbitrator nominated by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR acted in unison, arbitrarily rejecting the arguments put forward by the enterprise and the workers present and even by the third arbitrator, nominated by the enterprise; (iv) without any prior debate, the presiding arbitrator presented a draft award to the board, the content of which could not be justified since it was wholly devoid of any economic or legal analysis, and a number of clauses were approved in disregard of the overall nature of the award; in response to the third arbitrator s requests for explanation of the technical grounds for the draft award, the presiding arbitrator acknowledged that it had been drafted by the MPPPST and that any changes would therefore require the approval of the competent",0,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
12,"ministry official; (v) the arbitrator nominated by the enterprise said that he was obliged to make an out-of-hours visit to the headquarters of the Ministry on  October to speak to the author of the draft award, who (with the quiescence of the presiding and union-nominated arbitrators) defended it, agreed to introduce certain changes and demanded that it be signed also by the enterprise-nominated arbitrator, under the threat of greater financial losses being inflicted upon the enterprise; and (vi) the arbitration award published on  October  blatantly disregards the points of agreement reached by the parties to the direct and voluntary negotiations (the award disregards the content of  clauses that had been established by the parties and incorporates a modified version; it ignores the agreement of the parties to exclude  clauses regulating conditions of work and inserts them in the award; and it includes clauses that had never formed part of the draft collective agreement ' an extra petita case which it was beyond the competence of the arbitration board to settle). The complainants allege that these practices supplant freedom of association and the freedom to engage in collective bargaining with autocratic decisions imposed by the Government. The complainants consider that the imposition of arbitration and the overstepping of its lawful authority by the Government in the arbitration proceedings and the substance of the award set a very serious precedent that could become an instrument for the imposition of working conditions in private companies that disregard the wishes and the freedoms of the parties, particularly freedom of association and the freedom to engage in voluntary collective bargaining, in clear violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.Referring more broadly to the authorities' interference in the collective bargaining process, the complainant organizations recall that the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) made observations on certain provisions of the LOTTT and underlined the need to amend them, in particular section  concerning the presence of labour administration officials at collective bargaining negotiations. Even more serious in the view of the complainant organizations is section , which stipulates that, where collective disputes are referred to arbitration and where no agreement can be reached on the nomination of the third arbitrator at the end of five days, the latter will be appointed by the labour inspectorate (the CEACR considers that this method of appointment fails to ensure the parties' confidence either in the method or in the arbitration board thus established).
.The complainant organizations denounce the fact that, by Decision No.  of  December , the MPPPST unilaterally extended the arbitration award to  all subsidiary units of the enterprise throughout the country'  without submitting the collective dispute to any form of mediation and even though the dispute did not affect any services deemed essential or of public utility, and to the detriment of both voluntary collective bargaining and trade union pluralism. The complainants recall that the award should, under the terms of its own text, apply exclusively to the states of Amazonas, Apure, Aragua, Bolvar, Cojedes, Falcn and Gurico (and that, in this regard, Carabobo had actually been excluded as a pretext for barring SUTRABACARABOBO from the collective bargaining process). They consider this to be further proof of the systematic persecution suffered by the enterprise and recall once more that the enterprise had concluded collective labour agreements with the most representative trade union organizations at each of its establishments. This resulted in a total of  trade unions and  labour agreements (covering the various plants and agencies across the states where the enterprise is operational) existing alongside one illegal and unconstitutional arbitration award imposed and extended by the Government to favour the trade unions which had ties with its political party. As is stated in Decision No. , the compulsory extension responded to a request by the National Union of Workers of Foodstuff, Beer, Soft Drink, Spirit and Wine-Producing Enterprises (SINTRACERLIV), an organization whose membership accounts for only . per cent of the enterprise s unionized workers but whose leaders maintain close ties with the PSUV. The complainants consider that the aim of SINTRACERLIV and the Ministry of Labour is to contrive to give SINTRACERLIV the status of the most representative national organization (despite it lacking the necessary membership) and to assign it the capacity of sole administrator of the award at all enterprise locations throughout the country.
.The compulsory extension of the arbitration award for the duration of its validity ( months) effectively introduces a ban on voluntary collective bargaining at all the enterprise s workplaces, where various trade unions represent the majority of workers. To substantiate this, the complainant organizations send a copy of an administrative decision dated  February  whereby the labour inspectorate orders, by virtue of the extension of the arbitration award and for its entire duration, the suspension of negotiations relating to a draft collective agreement between the enterprise and another union (the Union of Workers of the Beverage Industry of Zulia State (SITIBEB-ZULIA).
.Furthermore, the complainant organizations allege that the acts denounced form part of a government-led campaign of intimidation, harassment and defamation against the various enterprises of the group, including the employing enterprise, whose chairman and FEDECAMARAS were groundlessly accused by representatives of the authorities, and even by the President of the Republic, of plotting and waging economic warfare against the Government. The complainants provide a detailed report of the systematic campaign of harassment in the media and on social networks (including repetitive and extensive broadcasts over many channels, particularly the state television channel, which sometimes airs reports specifically targeting the corporate group, and by way of the PSUV s social networks). As part of the campaign, there have been frequent and repetitive attacks by the President of the Republic and other senior and former state officials, including the former Vice-President of the National Assembly, ministers and members of parliament, in the form of groundless accusations and insults directed at the corporate group, its chairman and FEDECAMARAS, including: labelling them  enemies of the people'   traitors to their country' and drivers of the  economic warfare and destabilization' aimed against the country (threatening them with the full weight of the law should they fail to end the warfare, calling for their leaders to be prosecuted for their links to criminal gangs hoarding basic products, and even threatening to deprive the chairman of his freedom); accusing them of  hiding foodstuffs from the people'  conspiring abroad,  controlling the distribution of foodstuffs and financing the opposition'   consorting with criminal gangs' and denigrating the chairman of the corporate group as a  devil'   murderer' and  bourgeois exploiter'  as being  corrupt' and  a criminal who should be in jail'  According to the complainants, the President of the Republic declared that talking to the chairman of the corporate group would be tantamount to  treason' against the nation and constantly threatens the corporate group with expropriation. He also allegedly accuses the group of failing to produce basic foodstuffs and of hoarding foreign currency, when in fact it is unable to purchase imported inputs needed for production as it is denied access to official foreign currency (as a result of which a number of factories are unable to operate). The complainants allege that this campaign has been amplified through the enormous state media network, the Bolivarian Communication and Information System, which includes  Venezolana de Televisin'  the channel that in October , for example, dedicated , minutes of airtime to the Government s campaign of aggression. Furthermore, the complainants describe instances where public spaces and resources, including human resources, were used to hold defamatory events and activities and to disseminate information that was often spun to give the appearance of being news.
.The complainants also denounce the following acts of aggression: (i) the violent seizure, on  February , of five trucks belonging to the corporate group by factions shouting pro government and anti-corporate slogans, while police officers under the command of the Government failed to intervene; (ii) the moral and economic harassment of the corporate group by government-controlled inspection and regulatory bodies, examples of which include: intimidation through compulsory labour inspections, often in the presence of law enforcement officers, in particular a series of  inspections in four days, a total of over  inspections between  January and  August , inspections at the enterprise on  occasions between  April and  May , and an excessive, unjustifiable fine equivalent to US$, imposed in November  for alleged failure to provide requested information on time; (iii) cases of confiscation and expropriation, and threats of expropriation made by the President of the Republic himself, of the corporate group s facilities, with at least eight cases of permanent damage to the group s property, without any observance of legal requirements and procedures or of the constitutionally guaranteed rights to defence and due process; (iv) persecution and invasion of",-1,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
13,"the privacy of the group chairman, whose private conversations were recorded and who was threatened with deprivation of his freedom (this refers in particular to the TV broadcast of a conversation between the group chairman and an expatriate Venezuelan economist regarding the fragile state of the nation s economy. The then President of the National Assembly accused them both of  conspiring against the nation'  and the President of the Republic renewed his accusations of economic warfare and called for a judicial investigation and proceedings against the corporate group chairman); and (v) the harassment and detention of seven managers against the backdrop of suspended production due to shortages of raw materials and imported inputs; through irregular proceedings that violated the rights to defence and due process and disregarding the fact that the suspended production was due to force majeure, the authorities ordered the reinstatement of the workers; since it was impossible to comply with this, the managers were held in contempt of court and an order was issued for the illegal detention of these enterprise representatives (even though the detention did not exceed  hours, as a result of the legal action taken by the corporate group, precautionary measures as an alternative to detention were imposed in three cases, requiring, for example, the managers to appear before the courts and prohibiting them from leaving the country).
.Lastly, in their communication of  November , the complainant organizations denounce: (i) the continuation of the campaign of defamation and stigmatization against the corporate group, its chairman and FEDECAMARAS; (ii)  new instances of police detention of representatives of the corporate group in retaliation for alleged contempt of court declared without due process and in violation of the right to defence. Six of these instances resulted in indefinite restrictions on freedom (for example, bans on leaving the country, court summonses and orders to remain at the courts' disposal). The complainants highlight the fact that on the basis of the excessive power granted to the labour administration by the LOTTT, including the possibility of police detention in the event of failure to comply with administrative orders, the Government has led a campaign to persecute the corporate group and, as an illustration of the authorities' animosity and cruelty, they cite the arbitrary and extrajudicial -day detention of a manager charged with boycotting; and (iii) persecution and harassment through the presence of armed officials of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service in the vicinity of the corporate group s premises in Caracas and the chairman s home (the reasons for this presence remain unknown). In the light of the foregoing, the complainants consider that the harassment and intimidation of the corporate group by the Government have intensified.
.In a communication dated  September , the Government sent its observations in response to the allegations of the complainant organizations; these observations are set out below.
.As regards the allegation of the imposition of collective bargaining with a minority organization having no trade union tradition, the Government indicates that under no circumstances did it impose collective bargaining with SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR and that it is incorrect that the aforementioned trade union represents a minority of workers at the employing entity (hereinafter, the enterprise). The Government indicates that: (i) on  October , the competent authority, by Order No. -, accepted the submission of draft collective bargaining proposals by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR in accordance with the legal requirements; (ii) on  December , the enterprise exercised its right of defence, claiming that SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR was not the most representative organization; and (iii) by Order No. - of  March , the competent authority, noting that the dispute regarding representativeness was limited to the state of Carabobo (since the sphere of operation of the trade union that the enterprise considered the most representative was limited to Carabobo), and since there was a collective agreement in force for workers in Carabobo, proceeded to exclude the aforementioned state from the scope of negotiations and considered that there was no point in investigating the claimed lack of representativeness.
.As regards the complainants' allegation of damage resulting from the work stoppage instigated by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR with the support of the governing party and the Office of the Vice-President of the Republic, the Government indicates that the strike met the legal requirements with the establishment of minimum services, and so it had the full support of the State. The Government also indicates that it does not know whether the strike had the support of the PSUV and recalls that there is a vigorous democratic system in Venezuela which allows parties to concern themselves with social and labour issues; that the Government does not get involved in party campaigning activities; and that if any damage occurs, there are legal mechanisms for imposing penalties.
.As regards the allegation of the imposition of compulsory arbitration by the Ministry [of Labour], the Government states that SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR exercised its right to strike and that, even though essential public services were not affected, it is correct that, because of the territorial extension (with solidarity strikes) and the main dispute lasting more than  days, there was a danger to the productive employment that enables all workers to earn a decent living. The Government explains that it was because it was clearly impossible to reach agreements through  internal' mechanisms and recourse was needed to  external' mechanisms ' in this case, arbitration ' that the MPPPST ordered the collective dispute to be referred to arbitration through Decision No.  issued on  July , in accordance with section  of the LOTTT (which provides that  in the event of a strike which by its extension, duration or other serious circumstances constitutes an immediate danger to the life or safety of the whole or part of the population, even where the conciliation board has not concluded its work, the People s Minister for Labour shall, by means of a reasoned decision, bring the dispute proceedings and thereby the strike to an end and shall submit the dispute to arbitration' . As a result of the aforementioned decision, normal work operations could be resumed, thereby safeguarding the social process of labour and the human and constitutional right to conclude a collective labour agreement.
.As regards the allegation of interference in arbitration, the Government indicates that the appointed arbitrators were not under the instructions of the MPPPST since their election depended on the parties involved in the dispute ' namely, the enterprise and SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR ' and that both parties asked the MPPPST to appoint a third arbitrator. As regards the lack of impartiality denounced in the decision-making, the Government considers that this allegation is unfounded, as borne out by the fact that one of the arbitrators (nominated by the enterprise) expressed a concurring opinion since he held different views regarding certain points agreed upon by the majority.
.As regards the allegation that the arbitration award was in violation of what was decided autonomously during the voluntary collective bargaining, the Government argues that in equity-based arbitration the arbitrators must be fundamentally guided by what they consider most equitable, acting in full freedom and being able, on the basis of equity, to decide something different from what was previously agreed by the parties, without this violating any right.
.As regards the allegation that the extension of the award seeks to obstruct the negotiation of collective agreements until the expiry of the award, the Government indicates that Ministerial Decision No. , which was issued on  December  and extends the award, does not constitute any kind of obstacle to the conclusion of new collective labour agreements. Moreover, the Government denies that the compulsory extension modifies the bargaining model and affirms that, since only one enterprise is concerned and in order to protect the right to equal treatment that all workers enjoy, the purpose of the abovementioned extension was to protect, safeguard and implement the social process of labour.
.As regards the allegation that the Government discriminated against the trade unions that did not follow its political guidelines, as a result of which the extension of the award was granted at the request of a trade union (SINTRACERLIV) linked to the PSUV with the intention of contriving the status of most representative organization and the sole administrator of the award at the national level to the detriment of the other unions, the Government indicates that although the request from SINTRACERLIV was taken into consideration in the extension, it was not a case of giving SINTRACERLIV preferential treatment but because the aforementioned union made use of the right of petition established in article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. As regards the allegation that the aforementioned union has ties with the governing party (PSUV), the Government indicates that this complaint is of a political nature, since it directly opposes the Government, and does not come within the trade union sphere.
.As regards the allegation that the extension of the award was ordered by an authority that lacked competence and was not covered by any procedures that would have guaranteed",-1,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
14,"the right to defence and due process of the enterprise and the other  legitimately operating trade unions, the Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour has the necessary competence to issue the abovementioned administrative act under sections  and  of the LOTTT, which grant it the competence to enforce laws and regulations relating to labour and social security and to issue decisions and perform all actions within its competence necessary to achieve that end. Moreover, the Government indicates that at no time did it act outside the law, since the enterprise was aware, through the Official Gazette that published the arbitration award, of the request made to the Minister by the arbitration board to examine the compulsory extension of the collective agreement agreed upon by the award, so that this would be applied to all of the enterprise s offices and agencies throughout the country.
.As regards the allegations of a government media campaign identifying FEDECAMARAS and the corporate group to which the enterprise belongs as responsible for economic warfare and accusing them of hiding products from the people and controlling the distribution of foodstuffs, the Government states that the Committee is aware that FEDECAMARAS has participated as an organization in coups d at, illegal work stoppages and acts of sabotage against the economy of the country, and that it is regrettable that this organization has done nothing to put its past behind it; on the contrary, its actions have had more to do with political confrontation than trade union activity. To illustrate the political belligerence of the corporate group in question, the Government cites the example of the statements made by its chairman to the effect that the language and tone of the Head of State were not helping to generate confidence for investors, and emphasizes that FEDECAMARAS leaders expressed their support for revoking the mandate of the President of the Republic. The Government indicates that there is evidence of participation by the enterprise in the destabilization of the Venezuelan economy, using for political ends its market position and the financing of publicity campaigns involving attacks on the social and political process in the country.
.In reply to the complaints regarding accusations of conspiracy and economic warfare made by the President of the Republic and through the state television channel, and regarding acts of intimidation through forced inspections, the Government indicates that the corporate group in question has a major share in food production in the country, in which they actively participate in order to sabotage the economy. The Government emphasizes that the legal system allows inspections in enterprises and that while these practices occur on a daily basis in any enterprise, there are exceptions where they are undertaken exhaustively in the agri food industry. As regards the allegations of use of the media, the Government indicates that it has a constitutional obligation to keep the Venezuelan people informed and consequently there are many programmes and special features on the state TV channel to denounce the economic warfare and those largely responsible for it.
.The Government affirms that the spokespersons of the governing party exercise their democratic right of freedom of expression, recalling that the members of the National Assembly have special constitutional immunity to express opinions without any other authority being able to take legal action against them (these are prerogatives also enjoyed by opposition members). The Government emphasizes that the complex economic situation of the country is the result of falling oil prices and the destabilizing actions of powerful economic groups that hold a monopoly over food distribution and production in the country. The Government indicates that this situation has generated a climate of tension as regards the declarations and statements both from government representatives and from employers' and workers' representatives, given that full freedom of expression exists in the country.
.The Government also denies the allegations of exclusion from social dialogue since FEDECAMARAS and the corporate group participate in the National Council for the Economy, through one of their leaders. The Government denies that its intention is to suppress free entrepreneurship or freedom of association, emphasizing that there is vigorous private entrepreneurship in the country and that the Government has policies for boosting production.
.Lastly, the Government affirms that neither the president of FEDECAMARAS, nor the chairman of the corporate group or its workers have been harassed or persecuted by the Government, and so it rejects the accusations contained in the complaint. As regards the allegation of the detention of managers, the Government states that this is not the result of their connections with FEDECAMARAS but stems from violations of the law, often involving failure to implement reinstatement orders. The Government affirms in general terms that due process and access to defence lawyers has been guaranteed in all cases.
.The Government recalls that Venezuelan legislation provides for the possibility of reporting alleged assaults or cases of harassment, and also cases of defamation. Moreover, the Government confirms what it has already stated on other occasions with regard to similar allegations in the context of Case No. . Since it considers that there is no violation of Convention No.  in the acts described above, the Government requests the Committee to refrain from addressing issues that do not come within its remit and are unrelated to the aforementioned Convention, so that the latter does not continue to be used to satisfy individual political interests opposed to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.The Committee notes that the complaint is concerned with the following allegations: interference in the collective bargaining of the enterprise imposing the negotiation of proposals submitted by a minority trade union which is linked to, and supports, the governing party; acts of violence obstructing access to the workplace in the context of a strike; the illegal imposition of compulsory arbitration, and also interference and irregularities in the arbitration proceedings, and the illegal extension of the arbitration award; intimidation, harassment and defamation of the enterprise, the corporate group to which it belongs, its chairman and FEDECAMARAS by the authorities, the governing party and pro-government organizations, including allegations of threats, harassment, invasion of privacy, cases of confiscation and detention of workers with management responsibilities.
.The Committee notes that a number of the allegations concerning interference by the authorities in voluntary bargaining coincide with those raised in Case No.  (complaint against the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela presented by SUTRABACARABOBO.
.As regards the allegation of the imposition of collective bargaining with a minority trade union, the Committee notes the Government s indications that, as regards the bargaining process instigated by this union (SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR) which affected a number of states covered by the enterprise, the competent authority considered that: (i) the dispute over representativeness cited by the enterprise was confined to the state of Carabobo (where the union that the enterprise considered most representative was registered; as a result of that registration, the authority considered that it was not entitled to negotiate in other states); and (ii) since a collective agreement was in force for workers in Carabobo, it proceeded to exclude that state from the territorial scope of the negotiations, and consequently there was no point in investigating the claimed lack of representativeness.
.The Committee also notes that the complainant organizations recall that the practice of collective bargaining (undertaken on six occasions since ) consisted of concluding collective agreements with the most representative trade union organization in the state of Carabobo (where the biggest beer and malt beverage production plant in the country is located), the scope of the agreements being extended by mutual consent to workers employed in the other federal states comprising the  central commercial zone' (Amazonas, Apure, Aragua, Bolvar, Cojedes, Falcn and Gurico). The Committee notes the complainants' claim, which is not challenged by the Government, that the initial request from the enterprise was simply to extend the collective agreement which it had concluded with SUTRABACARABOBO. The Committee also observes that the complainants provided membership data (a criterion recognized by section  of the LOTTT as a crucial element for determining the representativeness of an organization for collective bargaining) as evidence of the greater representativeness of SUTRABACARABOBO, which was excluded from the negotiations initiated by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR. The Committee notes in this regard that the Government does not question these data, which appear to demonstrate that SUTRABACARABOBO is more representative than SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR (both in Carabobo and in the other states concerned).
.Moreover, in examining the whole process, the Committee is bound to note, with regard to the arguments concerning territorial scope indicated by the Government as forming the basis of the decisions of the competent authorities, that: (i) the authorities initially reduced the territorial scope of bargaining, excluding the state of Carabobo (thereby justifying the non-participation of SUTRABACARABOBO ' on the grounds that the union could only operate in Carabobo ' and conferring the right to bargain on the organization with alleged links to the governing party (SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR)); (ii) however, once the arbitration award had been adopted, the authorities took no account of the initially decreed territorial restriction (by virtue of which it",-1,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
15,"had been deemed unnecessary to establish which was the most representative organization); instead, they imposed the extension of the award to all workers in all states (once again without objectively assessing the representativeness of the organizations that such a decision concerned, and to the benefit of an organization (SINTRACERLIV) which the complainants allege to have ties with the governing party).
.Noting with regret that, despite the many occasions on which both the enterprise and the workers concerned underlined the need to verify the representativeness of the trade unions concerned through the provision of data and concrete proof of membership, the authorities took no account of the issues of representativeness raised, and referring to its conclusions in Case No.  regarding the sphere of operation of SUTRABACARABOBO, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the wishes of the majority of workers at the enterprise regarding their representation in collective bargaining and, accordingly, the wishes of the trade union deemed the most representative on the basis of an objective assessment of representativeness, are respected without any interference. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the allegations of acts of violence obstructing access to the workplace, in the context of a work stoppage instigated by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, the Committee notes the Government s indication that the strike was lawful and was therefore entitled to support from the State. The Committee regrets that the Government does not provide any information on the allegations of violence and requests it to report on the action taken in response to the complaint referred to by the complainants and on any proceedings initiated or decisions taken in relation to these allegations.
.As regards the allegations of unlawful recourse to compulsory arbitration, the Committee notes the Government s indication that, even though no essential services were affected, the extension and duration of the strike (over  days) meant that there was a danger to the productive employment that enables workers to earn a decent living, and so the order was given to refer the collective dispute to arbitration. The Committee also notes the complainants' claim that, as a result of this decision and to the detriment of voluntary collective bargaining, the outcome of the arbitration failed to honour the agreements reached by the parties during the bargaining phase (amending clauses that had already been agreed upon, reinstating clauses that had been removed, and inserting clauses that had never been part of the initial proposals for the collective agreement). In this regard, the Committee is bound to recall that state bodies should refrain from intervening to alter the content of freely concluded collective agreements [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. Moreover, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is the last resource available to workers' organizations to defend their interests, since the exercise of that right has serious consequences not only for the employers but also for the workers, who bear any resulting economic repercussions; hence those consequences cannot justify unilateral action by the Government restricting not only the right to strike but also the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining.
.The Committee also notes with concern the allegations of bias against the enterprise and irregularities and interference on the part of the authorities, regarding both the decision that referred the dispute to arbitration and the arbitration proceedings themselves. As regards the allegations of lack of impartiality on the part of the arbitrators and dependence on the instructions of the Government, described in detail by the complainants, the Committee notes that the Government merely states in reply to the allegations that each of the parties nominated one arbitrator, the MPPPST nominated another, and the arbitrator designated by the enterprise expressed a concurring opinion since he held different views regarding certain points agreed upon by the majority. The Committee also regrets that the Government has not provided any detailed observations concerning the specific allegations of irregularities in the arbitration proceedings and the arbitrary determination of content in the award, noting that the implementation of those proceedings was vigorously challenged both by the enterprise and by the union which presented the complaint addressed by Case No. . The Committee is bound to recall that in mediation and arbitration proceedings it is essential that all the members of the bodies entrusted with such functions should not only be strictly impartial but if the confidence of both sides, on which the successful outcome even of compulsory arbitration really depends, is to be gained and maintained, they should also appear to be impartial both to the enterprises and to the workers concerned [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.As regards the allegation of the illegal extension of the arbitration award, the Committee, while noting the Government s claim that the aim of the extension was to ensure equal treatment for workers, considers that the extension of an agreement adopted in a context where the status of the instigating organization as more representative and the legitimacy of the arbitration that gave rise to the award and the related proceedings were contested, should have been submitted to tripartite consultation, further to objective determination of the representativeness of the workers' organizations concerned. The Committee notes with concern that the extension of the award was imposed and that it is alleged ' and not denied by the Government ' that there was no discussion with the enterprise or the trade unions concerned, nor even an assessment of the representativeness of the unions affected (where it is also alleged and not denied by the Government that the union requesting the extension (SINTRACERLIV) is less representative, for example, than the union excluded from the initial proceedings (SUTRABACARABOBO)). The Committee further notes with concern that, according to the information provided and despite the Government s affirmation that the decision extending the award in no way impedes the conclusion of new collective agreements, the extension appears to have prevented the various representative trade unions concerned from subsequently exercising the right to collective bargaining (as illustrated by the abovementioned order of the labour inspectorate to suspend negotiations relating to a draft collective agreement during the period of validity of the extended arbitration award).
.Expressing its concern at the allegations of irregularities in the proceedings in question, and also at the restricting effect of the contested administrative decisions on the exercise of the right to collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure full respect for voluntary collective bargaining in accordance with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining, in particular ensuring that there is no recourse to compulsory arbitration in non-essential services, that when arbitration is appropriate its proceedings are impartial and the parties have confidence in them, and that the enterprise can engage in free and voluntary negotiation with the representative workers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the allegations that the provisions of the LOTTT enable the authorities to interfere in collective bargaining and in arbitration proceedings, the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not responded to these allegations. The Committee recalls, as do the complainants, that the CEACR has been examining these issues and has asked the Government: (i) to amend section  of the LOTTT (which provides that discussions of collective bargaining proposals shall be held in the presence of a labour administration official, who shall chair the meetings) to bring it into conformity with the principles of free and voluntary negotiation and the autonomy of the parties; and (ii) with regard to section  of the LOTTT (concerning the appointment of the arbitration board), to take steps, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to ensure that the parties have confidence in the composition of the arbitration board. In view of the fact that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified Convention No. , the Committee is referring the legislative aspects of this case to the CEACR and requests the Government to send the latter any additional information that is relevant in this respect.
.As regards the allegations of interference by the Government in favouring a minority trade union alleged to have ties with the governing party, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it does not know whether the PSUV supported the strike; that since the strike was declared lawful it had the support of the State; that parties are allowed to concern themselves with social and labour issues; and that the Government does not get involved in party campaigning activities. The Committee also notes that the Government neither denies nor comments on the complainants' specific allegations regarding various instances of interference through expressions of support for SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, often directed against the enterprise, both from the governing party (PSUV) (for example, through the use of its offices and communication channels) and from the public authorities (public officials such as a minister, a mayor and the ombudsman). The",-1,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
16,"Committee is bound to stress the importance of non-interference in activities of trade unions or employers' organizations either by the authorities or by the government political party and refers to its conclusions in Case No. . Expressing its deep concern at the numerous, detailed and serious allegations of lack of impartiality and interference by the governing party and the public authorities in the labour dispute in question, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to avoid interference of any kind in industrial relations between the enterprise and the workers' organizations operating there. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Lastly, the Committee notes with deep concern the serious and detailed allegations of intimidation, harassment and defamation by the authorities, the governing party and pro government organizations against the enterprise, its corporate group and the group chairman, and against the employers' organization to which the corporate group is affiliated (FEDECAMARAS). These include allegations of violence, harassment, invasion of privacy, cases of confiscation and detention of workers with management responsibilities. While recognizing the importance in terms of freedom of association of certain elements referred to by the Government ' namely, freedom of expression and the role of labour inspection as recognized by international labour standards ' the Committee considers that the aforementioned remarks do not constitute a satisfactory response to the numerous allegations of harassment and intimidation reported by the complainants. Moreover, the Committee recalls that the Government has a duty to ensure that the exercise of freedom of expression by FEDECAMARAS and its affiliated organizations is respected and cannot be used as a pretext for restricting the participation of that organization and its members in social dialogue. The Committee notes with regret that most of the Government s reply focuses on reiterating, and thus confirming, the accusations denounced by the complainants (for example, the accusations of economic warfare or sabotage of the economy and other actions of incitement to hatred against the enterprise and its management, and also against FEDECAMARAS, by the highest public authorities). The Committee recalls that it has repeatedly expressed deep concern at the many serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation of FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated organizations, leaders and affiliated companies, by the authorities or by groups or organizations with links to the governing party, and also at other connected allegations, such as that of exclusion from social dialogue, in the context of Case No. , to whose conclusions and recommendations the Committee refers. The Committee further notes that these allegations are also the subject of a complaint made under article  of the ILO Constitution against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which is being examined by the Governing Body.
.As regards the allegations of cases of detention and restrictions on the freedom of workers with management responsibilities in the corporate group to which the enterprise belongs, in violation of their right of defence, the Committee notes the Government s general statement, without additional detail, that the cases of detention do not relate to employer-organization activities but stem from non-compliance with judicial orders and that due process was ensured. The Committee further notes that the Government also denies any act of harassment, persecution or defamation and asserts that the legal system has mechanisms for addressing such accusations. In view of the divergent accusations of the complainants (who claim that these actions are connected with a campaign of harassment conducted by the Government against the corporate group and the employers' organization FEDECAMARAS) and the lack of precise information from the Government, the Committee recalls that the arrest of trade unionists and leaders of employers' organizations may create an atmosphere of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of trade union activities [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], and that in the cases concerning the arrest, detention or conviction of an employers' leader, the Committee considers that the person concerned should be entitled to be presumed innocent and that it is for the Government to demonstrate that the measures which it has taken do not stem from the employer-organization activities of the enterprise to which these measures apply. Noting the Government s indication that the alleged cases of detention are based on contempt of judicial orders and are unrelated to the activities of employers' organizations, the Committee invites the complainants to provide the Government and the Committee with any additional information at their disposal, especially relating to any complaint or legal action brought, and requests the Government to report in detail on the outcome of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in this respect, particularly with regard to the alleged cases of deprivation of freedom.
.As regards the allegations of seizure of the corporate group s property by violent factions, and also cases of confiscation and expropriation (or threats of expropriation) without satisfying the legal requirements and procedures or the constitutional guarantees of the right to defence and due process, the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not provided any specific observations in this respect. The Committee requests the Government to send detailed observations regarding these allegations and accordingly invites the complainants to provide any additional information at their disposal, particularly regarding any complaint or other legal action brought in this respect.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes with concern the complainants' additional allegations of  November  (including reports of the continuation of the campaign of defamation and stigmatization against the corporate group to which the enterprise belongs, its chairman and FEDECAMARAS;  new cases in which managers from the corporate group were detained by the police for alleged contempt of court, without any guarantee of due process and with the imposition of restrictions on freedom in six cases; and persecution and harassment through the presence of armed officials of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service in the vicinity of the corporate group s facilities in Caracas and the group chairman s home). The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter.
.Expressing its concern at the numerous allegations of threats, harassment and intimidation, the Committee is bound to recall the principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to take strong measures both to ensure that acts and statements of this kind are avoided and to ensure that a climate of constructive dialogue for promoting harmonious labour relations is restored.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining: (i) that voluntary collective bargaining is fully respected, ensuring that, when arbitration is appropriate, its proceedings are impartial and the parties have confidence in them, and that the enterprise can engage in free and voluntary negotiation with the representative workers' organizations; and (ii) that the will of the majority of the workers at the enterprise regarding their representation in collective bargaining and, accordingly, the will of the trade union deemed the most representative on the basis of an objective assessment of representativeness, are respected. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.Expressing its deep concern at the seriousness of the allegations made, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to avoid interference of any kind in industrial relations between the enterprise and the workers' organizations operating there. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to any proceedings initiated or decisions taken in relation to the allegations of acts of violence obstructing access to the workplace in the context of a strike, including the action taken in response to the complaint referred to by the complainant organizations.(d)	In view of the fact that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified Convention No. , the Committee is referring the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) and requests the Government to send the CEACR any additional information of relevance to the allegations that certain provisions of the Basic Act on Labour and Men and Women Workers (LOTTT) (sections  and ) enable interference by the authorities in collective bargaining and in the composition of arbitration boards.(e)	The Committee requests the Government to send detailed observations concerning the allegations of seizure of the corporate group s property by violent factions and also concerning cases of confiscation and expropriation (or threats of expropriation), and accordingly invites the complainant organizations to provide any additional information at their disposal, particularly regarding any complaint or other legal action brought in this respect; the Committee also invites the complainants to provide the Government and the Committee with any additional",-1,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
17,"information at their disposal concerning the allegations of cases of detention and restrictions on the freedom of workers with management responsibilities in the corporate group to which the enterprise belongs, especially relating to any complaint or legal action brought, and requests the Government to report in detail on the outcome of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in this respect, particularly with regard to the alleged cases of deprivation of freedom.(f)	The Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the latest allegations made by the complainant organizations, dated  November  (reported continuation of the campaign of defamation and stigmatization;  new cases in which managers from the corporate group were detained by the police; and persecution and harassment through the presence of armed officials of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service in the vicinity of the corporate group s facilities in Caracas and the group chairman s home).(g)	The Committee requests the Government to take firm measures both to ensure that any kind of statement, threat, harassment or intimidation against the corporate group to which the enterprise belongs, its chairman and the FEDECAMARAS is avoided, and to ensure that a climate of constructive dialogue for promoting harmonious labour relations is restored.",-1,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
18,".The complaint is contained in communications dated  November  and  March  from the Single Union of Workers in Industries Producing Beer, Soft Drinks and Nutritional Drinks in the State of Carabobo (SUTRABA CARABOBO).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  November  and  March , the Single Union of Workers in Industries Producing Beer, Soft Drinks and Nutritional Drinks in the State of Carabobo (SUTRABA CARABOBO) alleges that the public authorities interfered in its voluntary collective bargaining processes with Cervecera Polar CA (the employer, involved in the brewing and distribution of beer and malt), including by systematically discriminating against SUTRABA CARABOBO and promoting pro-Government trade union organizations, disregarding the greater representativeness of the complainant organization, depriving it of any means of defence, hindering its collective bargaining and imposing compulsory arbitration and extension of the resulting arbitration award.
.In its communication of  November , the complainant alleges that, on  October , the so-called Regional Union of Workers in the Territorio Centro Polar (SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR), an organization that had never been involved in a collective bargaining process , submitted a draft collective labour agreement in the States of Carabobo, Amazonas, Apure, Aragua, Bolvar, Cojedes, Falcn and Gurico (states in which SUTRABA CARABOBO represents the majority of workers and has the longest experience). On  December , the employer submitted a written document containing allegations and arguments against the draft collective agreement, pointing out that SUTRABA CARABOBO was the most representative trade union organization in the states concerned. However, the administrative authority, in a decision dated  March , based its formal argument on the fact that the complainant organization could only operate within the State of Carabobo since it was not registered as a regional trade union (disregarding the primacy of fact of its greater representativeness) and, without attempting to analyse the issue of representativeness, simply excluded the State of Carabobo from negotiations because an agreement was already in force in that state.
.The complainant alleges that, as a result of this administrative decision, the Ministry of Popular Power for the Social Labour Process (hereinafter  the Ministry'  unduly authorized SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR to enter into collective bargaining in workplaces in the States of Amazonas, Apure, Aragua, Bolvar, Cojedes, Falcn and Gurico, despite not being the most representative trade union organization in those states. Of the  workers concerned in the employer s branches in the above states (excluding the State of Carabobo), SUTRABA CARABOBO claims to represent  workers, or  per cent ' compared to  workers represented by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, or  per cent). The complainant provides detailed data comparing the respective membership numbers of the trade union organizations in each state, which show that in  of the  employer s branches in the states concerned over  per cent of unionized workers are members of SUTRABA CARABOBO, while SINTRARRICENTROPOLAR has less than  per cent of unionized workers in nine of the  branches and no members at all in four branches.
.The complainant also alleges that, during the bargaining process, the majority of workers expressed, in a variety of ways, their desire not to be represented by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, as they consider this union acts against their labour interests and integrity because its executives are merely puppets of the governing party (United Socialist Party of Venezuela ' PSUV) and uses violence against dissident workers. In support of these allegations, the complainant provides evidence that SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR press conferences are held in the PSUV press room. The complainant adds that rejection of SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR in favour of support for SUTRABA CARABOBO increased in the wake of the violent acts carried out by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR after it had submitted a list of contentious demands on  December . In this connection, the complainant alleges that a group of persons from outside the enterprise, carrying firearms, accompanied the president of SINTRATERRICETROPOLAR, in a show of support for him, to the vicinity of the Turmero works between  and  April . They prevented workers from carrying out their work, using threats and violence to try to make them abandon their work stations and join the work stoppage. The majority of workers refused and the incident led to SUTRABA CARABOBO representatives filing a criminal complaint on  April . The complainant further states that, in a clear case of interference in trade union matters, the mayor of the municipality of Santiago Mario in the State of Aragua, who belonged to the Government s PSUV party, came to the Turmero works to show his agreement to the work stoppage promoted by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, despite the fact that the majority of workers had rejected it.
.The complainant alleges that the Ministry s interference continued, disregarding the greater representativeness of SUTRABA CARABOBO and unduly recognizing the legitimacy of SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR. This included, once the deadline in the procedure for submitting the contentious list of demands had expired, imposing arbitration proceedings through Decision No.  dated  July  and further discriminating against SUTRABA CARABOBO by restricting its area of operation to the State of Carabobo, despite it having signed up workers as the most representative trade union in both of the states concerned.
.The complainant adds that, during the collective bargaining process and subsequent arbitration proceedings, the complainant, workers and employer all objected to SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR representation. In addition to making a number of statements to the public, the complainant s representatives met with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s Vice President and the Chairperson of the National Assembly s Comprehensive Social Development Committee, with detailed information and evidence showing that SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR was not representative and had lost the support of the workers and that SUTRABA CARABOBO had managed to unite the overwhelming majority. These allegations were also forwarded to the ombudsperson. However, according to the complainant, these arguments were not taken into account.
.The workers of the states concerned, meanwhile, requested the employer to extend the benefits in the collective agreement concluded with SUTRABA CARABOBO, already approved for the State of Carabobo on  December , to them, as they considered the agreement better serves their interests. This was verified in the records of the workers' assemblies organized by the complainant in each of the employer s branches, which the complainant attaches to its complaint. It appears from the records that at least two out of three workers of the  branches concerned requested the benefits in the agreement entered into with SUTRABA CARABOBO to be extended to them, to which the employer had agreed with effect from February .
.The complainant states that, during arbitration proceedings (ordered despite the fact that it had been agreed to extend the benefits of the agreement concluded by SUTRABA ARABOBO to all the states concerned), the workers went before the arbitration board appointed by the Ministry on several occasions to express their rejection of SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, but their right to participate to defend their interests, either themselves or through their trade union organization (SUTRABA CARABOBO), was not recognized. This rejection was expressed in writing by  union members on  September and  October . The complainant claims that the arbitration board appointed by the Ministry disregarded the many worker witnesses opposed to SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, with the strange argument that they had seemed keen for SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR not to handle the possible arbitration award. The arbitration board used the criterion in the Civil Procedure Code whereby  the enemy cannot testify against his enemy' to dismiss witnesses as interested parties when, clearly, in the context of the exercise of their right to freedom of association, the workers were legitimately interested in being represented by the trade union organization to which the majority had signed up. The complainant adds that, as neither the Ministry nor the arbitration board had taken its allegations into account, each of the  workers went in person to the Ministry (many of whom had been obliged to travel for more than  hours) to deposit their resignation from SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR in writing (in this regard, the complainant points out that the relevant authority required each of them to come in person).
.The complainant states that the employer also submitted its objections to the representativeness of SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR during these proceedings and defended SUTRABA CARABOBO s most representative status. However, the Government denied SUTRABA CARABOBO and its members the right to voluntary collective bargaining by depriving it of the right to operate outside the State of Carabobo, and its members (many from other states) the right to be represented by the trade union organization that they had freely joined. The complainant alleges that this means that both the Ministry and the arbitration board failed to verify the representativeness of SUTRABA ARABOBO and SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR in the other states concerned, even though they were aware that SUTRABA CARABOBO is the most representative union and should therefore have bargained collectively on",0,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
19,"behalf of the occupational category concerned.
.In its communication dated  March , the complainant maintains that it had been discriminated against by the authorities through additional obstacles to its collective bargaining with the employer, as well as the illegal extension of the arbitration award issued as a result of the abovementioned arbitration proceedings.
.The complainant alleges in general that several provisions of the Organic Labour and Workers Act and their implementation in practice violate the principle of voluntary collective bargaining provided for in Article  of Convention No. . The complainant refers to sections '  of the act regarding the involvement of the public authorities in collective bargaining, under which applications for collective bargaining must be submitted to the Ministry s labour inspectorates for their approval, officials from those inspectorates must be present in negotiations, and any agreements entered into must be submitted to the labour inspectorate for its approval. The complainant recalls that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has expressed its views on this matter, requesting in particular the amendment of section  of the Act.
.With regard to implementation of these provisions in this specific case, the complainant alleges that, despite the fact that SUTRABA CARABOBO complies with the provisions in its negotiations, the authorities blocked the collective bargaining process initiated by the union in September . The complainant states that, on  September , it submitted a draft collective agreement to the competent authorities to be negotiated with the employer and that, on  October  ( days later ' failing to comply with the legal deadline for the administration s response), the labour inspectorate issued a decision ordering the correction of mere formalities and irrelevant aspects of the records of the trade union assembly at which the draft agreement was approved (the decision found inconsistencies in the times referred to in the convocation, in the assembly record and in the list of workers). On  October , these formalities were corrected and, on  October, collective bargaining began with the employer. The collective agreement was concluded on  November  and registered on  December . The complainant alleges, however, that, in an act of anti-union harassment, on  December  (two days after registration of the agreement) the labour inspectorate gave notice of an alleged decision dated  November  ruling that the corrections of  September  to the draft agreement submission to the authorities were inadequate. The complainant considers that this allegation of the non-existent inadequacy of the corrections was clearly intended to hinder SUTRABA CARABOBO s voluntary collective bargaining. The complainant, despite these arbitrary acts, submitted a new collective agreement to the same labour inspectorate on  December  but, as of the date of its latest communication, it had still not been approved by the authority.
.Moreover, the complainant states that, in Decision No.  of  December , the Ministry ordered the extension of the arbitration award referred to above to all of the employer s workers (issued in the negotiations brokered by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR for some states). The complainant claims that the decision was allegedly handed down at the request of the National Union of Workers in Companies Producing Food, Beer, Soft Drinks, Liquor and Wine (SINTRACERLIV) and reports that this union does not represent the majority of the employer s workers countrywide ' as falsely stated in the decision; that it had no legal grounds for requesting the extension; and that the union is noted for its subservience to the political guidelines of the Government and the PSUV. In this respect, the complainant states that SINTRACERLIV only represents . per cent of unionized workers in the enterprise and that SUTRABA CARABOBO is more representative, given that it has  per cent of union members. The complainant alleges that the extension was ordered illegally because: (i) the Ministry does not have the authority to forcibly extend the arbitration award to all of the employer s establishments and workplaces; (ii) the procedure in force for labour standards meetings was not applied in order to guarantee SUTRABA CARABOBO and other trade union organizations the right to defence (there was no procedure to allow them to participate and defend themselves); (iii) compulsory extension does not apply to an enterprise not providing essential services in the strict sense (only in cases where a compulsory arbitration award would be permissible), or to public utility or crucial services; (iv) there was no collective labour dispute putting at risk the normal course of productive activities and justifying this extension; and (v) compulsory extension violates free and voluntary collective bargaining.
.The complainant claims that, as a result of this decision on extension, SUTRABA ARABOBO and the other trade unions concerned may be prevented from engaging in collective bargaining and concluding collective agreements, undemocratically imposing the implementation of the arbitration award countrywide and handing over its administration to a single trade union that is subservient to the Government and the PSUV. In this regard, the complainant refers to an administrative decision dated  February , in which the labour inspectorate, pursuant to the extension of the arbitration award, ordered the suspension of negotiations on a draft collective agreement between another trade union (the Workers' Union of the Beverages Industry in the State of Zulia ' SITIBEB ULIA) and the employer while the award was in force. The complainant therefore alleges that the Government is discriminating against and undermining SUTRABA CARABOBO, while promoting SINTRACERLIV and membership of that union and its intention to handle the arbitration award and negotiations on future agreements at national level.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government provides its observations on the allegations of the complainant (detailed below). In general, it states that the Government guarantees freedom of association and the exercise of that right and that the actions of the Ministry have in no way contravened the freedom of association of the complainant organization, or discriminated against or interfered with it.
.The Government refutes the allegation that the arbitration board had been appointed by the Ministry and states that one member was appointed by the employer, another by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR representatives and that, failing to reach agreement on the appointment of the third member, the Ministry had been required to appoint that member. With regard to the arbitration board s decisions, the Government maintains that it had not interfered in them in any way, given that its members were from third parties unrelated to the parties and the Government.
.The Government also rejects the allegation that SUTRABA CARABOBO was discriminated against and even more so the suggestion that it was for political reasons. The Government states that this trade union was not included in the collective bargaining in question because of its territorial area of operation and that, as its name indicates, it is an organization belonging to the State of Carabobo. Thus, there was no reason for it to participate, since collective bargaining did not cover workers in this state (given that, at the time of the submission of the agreement by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, there was already an agreement in force for workers in the State of Carabobo). In this regard, the Government states that, in response to the objections of the enterprise to the lack of representativeness of SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR in comparison with SUTRABA ARABOBO, the competent authority, having excluded the State of Carabobo from negotiations because of an existing agreement in force there, considered it futile to review the alleged lack of representativeness, as it centred on the representativeness of a trade union whose area of operation was the State of Carabobo. The Government recalls that section  of the Organic Labour and Workers Act provides that trade union organizations may be local, state, regional or national and that, at the time it was established and in line with its own internal statutes, SUTRABA CARABOBO had restricted its activities to the State of Carabobo. By signing up workers who provide services in other states, without changing its area of operation, it is violating the provisions of those statutes. The Government emphasizes that the territorial boundary is set for a trade union organization from its inception and does not change until the organization decides to extend its area by amending its internal statutes. The Government recalls that, according to section  of the Act, a trade union organization s assembly or board cannot take decisions in contravention of its own statutes ' a provision that the administrative authority could not ignore. On the other hand, SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, as a regional trade union organization, could represent workers from several states. The Government points out that the fact that SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR is a fledgling organization without a track record in collective bargaining does not preclude it from exercising its right to collective bargaining, provided it complies with the legal requirements. This was verified in October  by the labour inspectorate in its Decision No. - supporting the collective agreement submitted.
.The Government declines to give its view on the allegation that SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR executives act as puppets of",-1,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
20,"the PSUV because this is a subjective fact, clearly political in nature and going beyond the trade union realm and into direct government opposition. It therefore considers that the Committee should not comment on matters of this nature, which are beyond its remit.
.With regard to the allegations of violent acts, the Government reports that it requested information from the public prosecutor s office, which it will forward to the Committee once it has been received.
.With respect to the decision taken by the employer to apply the benefits of the agreement entered into with SUTRABA CARABOBO and approved in December  to all workers from February , the Government welcomes the decision, which will ensure equal treatment.
.Regarding the allegation that the public authorities had required each of the workers wishing to register their resignations from SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR to do so in person, the Government points out that the National Register of Trade Unions cannot accept resignations submitted by a third party who is not authorized to do so through a power of attorney. It also points out that resignations are normally tendered to executive committees and not registered directly in the records kept of the proceedings of each trade union organization.
.The Government refutes the allegation that there is no rule in the legal system that allows the Ministry to extend an arbitration award or collective agreement, recalling that section  of the Organic Labour and Workers Act: (i) provides that the collective labour agreement concluded in a labour meeting or the resulting arbitration award can be declared compulsory for extension to other employers and workers in the same branch of activity by the ministry responsible for labour matters; and (ii) section  provides that, when an enterprise has departments or branches in locations belonging to different jurisdictions, the collective agreement it concludes with the trade union organization representing the majority of its workers will apply in those departments or branches.
.Concerning the allegations challenging the legitimacy of SINTRACERLIV to request the extension of the arbitration award, the Government states that, in the extension of the arbitration award, SINTRACERLIV s petition was considered because this trade union organization exercised the right of petition provided for in section  of the Venezuelan Constitution, referring to the right of every person to address petitions to any public authority. The Government adds further that the extension was initially requested by the Ministry s arbitration board.
.With regard to the allegation that SUTRABA CARABOBO and the other trade unions concerned had been prevented from engaging in collective bargaining after the application and extension of the arbitration award, the Government maintains that the Organic Labour and Workers Act recognizes the right to collective bargaining for representative trade unions (which must demonstrate their representativeness), provided that no peremptory challenges are made, including the existence of a collective agreement already in force and the absence of any discussion with another union. In this case, the representativeness of the different organizations concerned should be challenged. The Government also warns of the legal and practical implications of an increase in disputes in collective labour relations and the undermining of the legal certainty of these relations when, with a collective agreement still in force, a trade union association attempts to demand another agreement be negotiated and concluded.
.The Committee notes that the complaint concerns allegations of interference by the public authorities in voluntary collective bargaining, promoting pro-Government trade union organizations and discriminating against the complainant organization (disregarding its greater representativeness, depriving it of any means of defence, hindering its collective bargaining and imposing the compulsory extension of an arbitration award), and acts of violence preventing access to the workplace in the context of a work stoppage.
.The Committee notes that several of the allegations concerning interference by the authorities in voluntary collective bargaining correspond to those raised in Case No.  (complaint filed against the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela by the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Manufacturers' Associations (FEDECAMARAS).
.With regard to the allegations of discrimination against the complainant organization by excluding it from the bargaining process initiated by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, without taking into account the former s greater representativeness, the Committee notes, on the one hand, that the Government states that the complainant organization was unable to take part because this process went beyond its area of operation. The Government points out that the complainant organization, according to its own statutes, is a state-level organization (being attached to the State of Carabobo) and that, on the other hand, SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR has a regional scope, meaning that its operations can cover several states. The Government claims that the authorities could not take decisions that were contrary to the statutes of the complainant organization. In this regard, the Committee invites the complainant organization, if it so wishes, to consider amending its statutes, as appropriate, to adjust the area of operations covered by its activities. The Committee notes that the Government further claims that, since a collective agreement was already in force in the State of Carabobo, it was excluded from negotiations and it was therefore unnecessary to look into the issue of which organization was the more representative.
.The Committee also notes that, as claimed by the complainant and not denied by the Government, SUTRABA CARABOBO has numerous members in other states (in addition to the State of Carabobo) and the application of collective agreements concluded by SUTRABA CARABOBO would have been extended to workers in the other states. The Committee also notes that the Government does not contest the data on membership provided by the complainant, which would show its greater representativeness in terms of membership numbers (a criterion laid down in section  of the Organic Labour and Workers Act as a key element in determining the representativeness of an organization in collective bargaining) both in comparison to SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR and SINTRACERLIV. The Committee notes that, as alleged by the complainant and not disputed by the Government, a considerable number of workers affected by the draft collective bargaining agreement, as well as the employer, had reportedly opposed negotiating with SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, providing statements and evidence on numerous occasions to demonstrate that the complainant organization was more representative.
.Furthermore, in reviewing the development of the whole case, the Committee cannot fail to observe, with regard to the arguments on the territorial area that the Government states formed the basis of the decisions taken by the relevant authorities, that: (i) while initially the authorities reduced the territorial scope of negotiations, excluding the State of Carabobo (thus justifying the non-participation of the complainant organization and recognizing the entitlement to negotiate of the trade union organization alleged to be close to the governing party (SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR)); and (ii) once the arbitration award had been adopted, the authorities did not take into account the territorial restriction initially prescribed (thus disregarding the need to examine which organization was the most representative) and instead extended the award to all workers in all states (again without objectively considering the representativeness of the trade union organizations affected by such a decision, to the advantage of one organization (SINTRACERLIV), which the complainant alleges to be allied to the governing party).
.Regretting that, despite the fact that the complainant, employer and the workers concerned have on numerous occasions argued the need to verify the representativeness of the trade union organizations involved, providing specific data and evidence on membership numbers, the authorities failed to take into consideration the issues raised on representativeness ' and referring to its previous conclusions on the issue of SUTRABA CARABOBO s area of operation ' the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that, without any interference, the majority will of the employer s workers with regard to their representation in collective bargaining is respected and, in this connection, of the most representative trade union organization, by carrying out an objective verification of representativeness. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the allegations of violent acts preventing access to the workplace in the context of the work stoppage promoted by SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, the Committee notes that the complainant filed a criminal complaint and that the Government states that, once it has received information from the public prosecutor s office, it will forward this to the Committee. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the criminal complaint and of any proceedings initiated and decisions taken regarding these allegations.
.Concerning the allegations of discrimination against the complainant organization by extending the arbitration award resulting from compulsory arbitration (the complainant argues that the Ministry lacked the necessary authority and that the extension was in favour of a less representative union allied to the governing party (SINTRACERLIV)), the Committee notes that the Government states: (i) that the Organic Labour and Workers Act confers on the Ministry the authority to declare the compulsory extension of a collective agreement concluded in a labour meeting or the resulting arbitration award; and (ii) that in the extension of the arbitration award SINTRACERLIV s petition",1,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
21,"was considered because this trade union organization exercised the right of petition provided for in article  of the Venezuelan Constitution, referring to the right of every person to address petitions to any public authority. With regard to the imposition of arbitration proceedings, the Committee refers to its conclusions in Case No. . As for the decision to extend the resulting award, the Committee considers that the extension of an agreement adopted when the greater representativeness of the organization that had promoted it was in dispute, as well as the legitimacy of the arbitration that had given rise to the award and its proceedings, should have been the subject of a tripartite consultation once the representativeness of the workers' organizations concerned had been objectively determined. The Committee also notes that both the complainant and, as is clear from examination of Case No. , the employer dispute the arbitration proceedings and extension of the arbitration award (alleging discrimination and irregularities ' in particular bias and interference by the authorities). The Committee is compelled to recall in this respect that in mediation and arbitration proceedings it is essential that all the members of the bodies entrusted with such functions should not only be strictly impartial but, if the confidence of both sides, on which the successful outcome even of compulsory arbitration really depends, is to be gained and maintained, they should also appear to be impartial both to the employers and to the workers concerned [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure full respect for voluntary collective bargaining, in conformity with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining, in particular by ensuring that the will of the parties to collective bargaining is respected and that, where arbitration is applicable, the proceedings are impartial and have the confidence of the parties. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.Regarding the allegations of hindering collective bargaining by the authorities using delaying tactics and extending the arbitration award, the Committee notes that the Government merely points out that the Organic Labour and Workers Act recognizes the right to collective bargaining provided that the organizations can justify their representativeness and no peremptory challenges are made, including the existence of a collective agreement already in force. The Committee regrets that, despite the fact that in Case No.  the Government states that the decision extending the arbitration award does not indicate any impediment to concluding new collective agreements, the Government fails to make it explicitly clear whether the arbitration award and its extension have in practice limited the opportunities for the complainant and other trade unions to bargain collectively, or provide its views on the administrative decision referred to by the complainant in this respect (under which the labour inspectorate had reportedly suspended collective bargaining between another union and the employer while the arbitration award extended by the Ministry s decision remained in force). The Committee notes with concern that the extension of the arbitration award appears to have prevented exercise of the right to collective bargaining by the various trade union organizations concerned. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the complainant and other representative organizations are able to freely negotiate with the employer beyond the stipulations under the arbitration award. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the allegations that some provisions of the Organic Labour and Workers Act (sections ' ) would allow the authorities to interfere in collective bargaining, the Committee regrets that the Government has failed to respond to them. The Committee recalls, as does the complainant, that the CEACR has been examining these issues and has requested the Government to: (i) amend section  of the Act (which provides that discussion of proposals for collective bargaining will take place in the presence of a labour official, who will chair the meetings) to bring it into line with the principles of free and voluntary negotiation and autonomy of the parties; and (ii) with a view to finding solutions to the issues raised, to conduct a tripartite dialogue on the question of the application in practice of section  of the Act (concerning the registration of a collective agreement, and which states that the labour inspectorate will verify its conformity with the applicable public order regulations, with a view to granting approval) and section  of the Act (concerning the granting of approval, and which states that, if the labour inspectorate considers it appropriate, it will make the appropriate observations or recommendations to the parties instead of granting approval, to ensure compliance). In view of the fact that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified Convention No. , the Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the CEACR and requests the Government to provide it with any relevant additional information.
.As for the allegations of interference by the authorities to the detriment of the complainant organization and to the advantage of other trade union organizations alleged to be close to the governing party (PSUV), the Committee notes that the Government declines to give its view on the alleged link between SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR and the PSUV because it is a subjective fact that is clearly political in nature and goes beyond the trade union realm and into direct opposition to the Government. It therefore considers that the Committee should not comment on matters that are beyond its remit. In regard to this, the Committee is compelled to recall the importance of non-interference in trade union activities, both by the authorities and the Government s political party, and reiterates that these issues form part of its mandate. In this connection, the Committee recalls that, in the interests of the normal development of the trade union movement, it would be desirable to have regard to the principles enunciated in the resolution on the independence of the trade union movement adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session () that the fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement is the economic and social advancement of the workers and that when trade unions, in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members, decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of the trade union movement or its social or economic functions, irrespective of political changes in the country [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.With this in mind, the Committee notes that the Government does not deny the allegations and information provided by the complainant to substantiate the allegations of government support, through its party, for SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR, which is to the detriment of the complainant organization (for example, the use of PSUV media channels for SINTRATERRICENTROPOLAR press releases or public authority support for this union s actions). In addition, with respect to the decisions of the authorities, whose bias has been alleged, and based on information provided by the complainant, which the Government does not contest, the Committee can only challenge: (i) on the one hand, the failure to include the complainant organization in the decision-making process to extend the arbitration award  which would affect the State of Carabobo as well ' or the arbitration board s use of the rules of the Civil Procedure Code to exclude the opposing party in order to avoid taking into account in proceedings the allegations of its union members, considering them to be interested parties; and (ii) on the other hand, applying the rules to trade union organizations alleged to be close to the governing party to accommodate the claims of these organizations ' for example, to impose compulsory arbitration (the Government, in its reply to Case No. , states that these proceedings were based on the fact that, due to the strike s extent and duration (more than  days), productive employment providing each worker with a decent existence was under threat, despite the fact that, as the Government itself acknowledges, essential services were not affected, or to extend the resulting arbitration award (using as justification for supporting the extension the general right of petition)).
.Noting with concern the numerous detailed allegations of bias and interference by the governing party and the public authorities in the labour dispute, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to prevent any interference in industrial relations between the complainant and the employer. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee invites the complainant organization, if it so wishes, to consider amending its statutes, as appropriate, to adjust the area",-1,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
22,"of operation covered by its activities.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps, in conformity with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining, to: (i) ensure full respect for voluntary collective bargaining, in particular by ensuring that the will of the parties to collective bargaining is respected and that, where arbitration is applicable, the proceedings are impartial and have the confidence of the parties; (ii) ensure respect for the majority will of the employer s workers with regard to their representation in collective bargaining and, in that connection, of the most representative trade union organization, by carrying out an objective verification of representativeness; (iii) ensure that the complainant and other representative organizations are able to freely negotiate with the employer beyond the stipulations under the arbitration award; and (iv) prevent any interference in industrial relations between the complainant and the employer. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any proceedings initiated and decisions taken in relation to allegations of violent acts preventing access to the workplace in the context of a work stoppage, including developments in the criminal complaint referred to by the complainant.(d)	In view of the fact that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified Convention No. , the Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the CEACR and requests the Government to provide it with any relevant additional information regarding the allegations that some provisions of the Organic Labour and Workers Act (sections ' ) would allow the authorities to interfere in collective bargaining.",-1,2015,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
23,".The Committee last examined this case at its May June  session and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent additional observations in communications dated  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case at its May June  session, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure that intervention of the forces of law and order in trade union demonstrations to defend their occupational interests is in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and to bear in mind that governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence and should not resort to arrests in the absence of clear grounds for filing criminal charges against demonstrators. The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for these principles.(b)	The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide additional information on the allegations regarding arbitration and interference by the authorities.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that peaceful protest is a legitimate right enshrined in the country s Constitution and that the State respects the exercise of this right to protest as long as it does not endanger the lives or the physical, psychological and moral integrity of the rest of the population, freedom of movement, public order and the security of the nation. The Government recalls that the exercise of civil, political and labour rights cannot be invoked to commit unlawful acts. It adds that it is the responsibility of the State to protect citizens, property and institutions from unlawful acts committed during violent protests. The Government also maintains that the actions of the police and security forces are in strict conformity with the law and that only in circumstances involving unlawful acts against individuals, properties or institutions are they called upon to fulfil their duty to protect the latter.
.Moreover, the Government emphasizes that the right to strike is also enshrined in the national Constitution, and therefore all workers may exercise this right while fulfilling the requirements of the law. However, no individual, while exercising the right to strike, may commit unlawful acts involving the obstruction of free movement, damage to property, people or institutions, or any other offence or crime. The Government indicates that the security forces intervene only when acts are committed which violate the law currently in force and that the procedures, methods and decisions of the judicial bodies are firmly grounded in the law.
.The Government stresses that there has been no action or omission on the part of the Venezuelan Government which could be presented as a violation of the principles of freedom of association, the right to organize or the right to strike and that the Government is a guardian of these principles. It therefore requests the Committee to stop making unfounded statements to the effect that the Government is not complying with these principles.
.Lastly, the Government requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of the allegations concerning arbitration and interference by the authorities if the complainant organizations have not provided additional information and therefore calls for the case to be closed.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements with regard to recommendation (a) from its previous examination of the case, in which the Committee requested the Government to ensure that intervention of the forces of law and order in trade union demonstrations to defend their occupational interests was in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities were attempting to control and to bear in mind that governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities received adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence and should not resort to arrests in the absence of clear grounds for filing criminal charges against demonstrators. The Committee firmly expects that the Government will ensure that this recommendation is fully implemented.
.Regarding recommendation (b) of its previous examination of the case, the Committee notes that the complainant organizations have not provided the requested additional information on the allegations regarding arbitration and interference by the authorities. Under the circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, and firmly expecting that the Government will ensure the full implementation of its recommendation concerning the intervention of the forces of law and order in trade union demonstrations, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a joint communication dated  June  from the National Union of Workers of Venezuela (UNETE), the Federation of Bolivarian Trade Unions of the State of Carabobo (FUSBEC) and the Single Union of Workers of Galletera Carabobo (SINTRAEGALLETERA).
.The Government sent observations in a communication dated  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  June , UNETE, FUSBEC and SINTRAEGALLETERA allege that on  June , following a breakdown of collective bargaining between the trade union and the enterprise, SINTRAEGALLETERA sent a list of demands to the Labour Inspectorate of Batalla de Vigirima in the state of Carabobo and this led to the initiation of conciliation proceedings. Furthermore in August , the Assembly of Workers rejected a proposal to submit the dispute to arbitration and on  September , the head of the labour inspectorate submitted a final report on the dispute, in which she stated that the workers involved could suspend their activities and operations (a legal strike) whenever they wished, subject to provision of the minimum essential services.
.The complainant organizations allege that, on the morning of  December , the Galletera Carabobo workers blocked the entrance to the Southern Motorway as a protest action in the hope that their demands as employees and workers would be taken into account. During this demonstration, however, Bolivarian National Guard troops appeared on the scene, violently broke up the demonstration and arrested UNETE coordinator Ms Marcela Mspero and four other trade union leaders, injuring Ms Mspero and Mr Julio Polanco. The two leaders, together with Mr Edgar Jimnez, Mr Roberto Ypez and Mr Jos Guilln, were taken to Regional Command No. .
.On  December , the fourth chamber of the judicial district of the state of Carabobo labour court of first instance, located in Valencia, issued a judgment upholding an amparo (protection of constitutional rights) appeal brought by several Galletera Carabobo workers (seeking to exercise their right to work during the strike).
.On  January , the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security issued Decision No. , in which it unilaterally ordered that the collective labour dispute be referred to an arbitration committee. It also ordered the Labour Monitoring Unit to visit the enterprise s Carabobo facility in order to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions necessary for the start-up of production and declared the industrial action closed.
.Thus, according to the complainants, the trade union s right to strike was violated by a Ministry of Labour decision ordering that the dispute be referred to an arbitration committee. These actions constitute a violation not only of constitutional rights, namely, the right to strike, but also of the right to have access to justice free of charge since the arbitrator selected to represent the trade union is charging , Venezuelan Bolivars (VEF) ' the equivalent of  times a worker s monthly wage ' in professional fees, which the trade union cannot afford.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that Galletera Carabobo and its trade union, SINTRAEGALLETERA, found it quite difficult to negotiate the collective agreement owing to disparities between the trade union s demands and the employer s proposals.
.On  June , the union requested the labour inspectorate s authorization to convert the draft collective agreement under negotiation to a list of dispute grievances. The trade union s request was addressed, without halting the collective bargaining, until the end of June, when the employer indicated that it was impossible to reach an agreement.
.Once the collective bargaining had been suspended, the labour inspectorate proposed that the two parties should seek a solution to their dispute through arbitration. On  August , the union reported that, in a general meeting, the workers had rejected the arbitration proposal and reiterated its request to initiate an industrial action. On  August , the legal requirements for the exercise of the right to strike under the Constitution of",0,2014,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
24,"the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela were met. However, despite the work stoppage at Galletera Carabobo, the employer and the union were unable to produce dispute settlement proposals through negotiations.
.On  October , a group of  Galletera Carabobo workers held a general meeting. In light of the continuing stalemate and so-called unconcerted action by the union, a proposal to end the strike was tabled and approved by the workers present. The union opposed this position and maintained that the general meeting was unlawful because it had not been organized by the trade union. Faced with a stand-off, a group of  workers brought amparo (protection of constitutional rights) proceedings before the courts, maintaining that the union was preventing them from exercising their right to work.
.The Government explains that, on the morning of  December , a small group of workers and leaders of the trade union confederation UNETE (some  people) blocked the entrance to the Southern Motorway  as a protest action in the hope that their demands as employees and workers would be taken into account'  as stated in the complaint. This motorway is the primary artery between the population centres and the main industrial areas situated along it; it is also a transport route from the centre of the country. The inexplicable closure of this important artery prevented thousands of workers from reporting to work, night shift workers from returning home and hundreds of tonnes of food from being delivered to and from the centre of the country.
.In the Government s view, a dispute between the employer of an enterprise with fewer than  workers and the union did not justify a protest action that harmed hundreds of thousands of people since the action itself was not remotely related to the employer or the enterprise, which is located several kilometres from the place where it occurred.
.The Government indicates that officers of the Bolivarian National Guard, which is responsible for policing Venezuela s transport arteries, used this argument and others in an effort to convince the small group of people to leave and allow the passage of vehicular traffic. However, all attempts at mediation proved fruitless and when access had been blocked for an hour with the resulting traffic jam several kilometres long, the Bolivarian National Guard was forced to remove these people from the Southern Motorway in order to enforce the constitutional right to free passage. As a result of their obstruction of the action of the Bolivarian National Guard, five people were arrested; they were released that evening.
.Furthermore, on  December , the fourth chamber of the state of Carabobo labour court of first instance, located in Valencia, issued a judgment upholding the amparo appeal brought against the union by  workers. In light of the court s decision, most of the workers returned to work while respecting the right to strike of those who did not wish to return. In addition, on  January , a group of  Galletera Carabobo workers who were still on strike, led by the Secretary of Finance of the union, went to the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security in Caracas to demand the immediate  referral of the case for arbitration because, according to them, employment stability was being threatened by the measures taken and they firmly believed that the State would ensure that the workers' demands were met since the equitable distribution of wealth should be the primary goal of a Government that endorsed socialism'  They also called on the then Minister, Ms Mara Cristina Iglesias, to speed up  ...the compulsory arbitration envisaged in article  of the Labour and Workers Organization Act  ? The union posted this document on its website and, in response to the aforementioned petition, the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security issued a decision ordering that the dispute be referred for compulsory arbitration. It is therefore totally untrue that the arbitration was imposed; rather, the request of the union was granted. Only then did the strike end.
.Pursuant to the Labour and Workers Organization Act, in preparation for the arbitration, the parties were invited to select the arbitrators. SINTRAEGALLETERA chose one arbitrator from a list of three submitted by the employer and the employer chose another from a list of three submitted by SINTRAEGALLETERA; however, they were unable to agree on the third arbitrator. By law, the third arbitrator was chosen at random from a list of lawyers in private practice who had volunteered to serve as arbitrators in labour disputes.
.The Government explains that the Venezuelan Government had nothing to do with selecting the arbitrators or with their decisions; thus, each of the arbitrators sets his or her professional fees which the parties must pay.
.In light of the foregoing, the Government concludes that:' At no time was there a violation of the right to strike, which was freely exercised by the union members from October  to January .' As the claimant organizations recognize in their submission, the arrest of five people on  December  was a consequence of the interruption of free movement of traffic on the Southern Motorway. They refer to this action as a strike against the company but have yet to explain how blocking traffic on a motorway several kilometres away from the enterprise was in any way related to the dispute that was ongoing at the time.' The action taken by the Bolivarian National Guard in removing the people who were blocking traffic on the Southern Motorway on  December  in no way violated the right to strike of the workers who were doing so at Galletera Carabobo, several kilometres away; the strike continued unhindered until January .' On  January ,  SINTRAEGALLETERA members submitted a public petition requesting the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security to order compulsory arbitration. This petition was granted, the arbitration was ordered and, in accordance with the law, the strike was ended voluntarily at the request of the union members.' The arbitrators were selected in accordance with the law, are independent of the Government and set the amount of their own professional fees, which must be paid by the parties with no State involvement.' Lastly, the Government maintains that no act or omission by the Venezuelan Government can be portrayed as a violation of the principles of freedom of association, the right to organize or the right to strike. It therefore requests that the present complaint be closed.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege that the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security violated the right to strike of the trade union SINTRAEGALLETERA, following a breakdown of collective bargaining with the enterprise Galletera Carabobo, by unilaterally referring the collective dispute for compulsory arbitration in January  and that the arbitrator selected to represent the trade union is charging VEF, ' the equivalent of  times a worker s monthly wage ' in professional fees.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that: () at no time was the right to strike violated; it was freely exercised without hindrance by the workers from October  to January ; () on  October ,  Galletera Carabobo workers held a general (non-union) meeting and proposed that the strike be ended in light of the continuing stalemate and unconcerted action by SINTRAEGALLETERA. The trade union opposed this position. In response,  workers brought amparo (protection of constitutional rights) proceedings before the courts, requesting to be allowed to exercise their right to work; their appeal was upheld in a judgment dated  December ; () on  January ,  trade union members who were still on strike, led by the trade union s Secretary of Finance, petitioned the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security in writing to request that the case be referred for compulsory arbitration; this petition was also posted on the SINTRAEGALLETERA website and was granted as a request by the trade union; only then did the strike end; and () contrary to the complainants' statements, the arbitrators themselves set their professional fees with no State involvement; the name of the arbitrator selected to represent the trade union was included in a list that the union had submitted.
.The Committee notes that the trade union declared a strike, which began in October  and continued until  January , and observes from the Government s replies that the strike was challenged by many of the enterprise s workers, according to the Government,  of the nearly  workers who, at a non-union meeting, proposed that the strike be ended and/or by  workers who requested and were granted court enforcement of their right to work.
.Concerning the Government s statement regarding the petition for compulsory arbitration that was submitted by  trade union members, led by one of the trade union s leaders, in early January  and was posted on the trade union s website, the Committee is unable to determine whether",0,2014,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
25,"' as the Government maintains ' this was an official trade union petition or whether ' as the complainant organizations maintain in their complaint (signed by the General Secretary of the trade union) ' it was a unilateral action by the Ministry.
.The Committee cannot discount the possibility of a disagreement between the trade union s leaders on the issue of compulsory arbitration. Given the contradictions between the allegation and the Government s reply and the fact that the strike did, in fact, take place from October  to January , the Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide additional information in respect of the allegations regarding arbitration and interference by the authorities.
.With respect to the allegation that, on  December , Bolivarian National Guard troops violently broke up a demonstration by enterprise workers in Carabobo in support of their demands; that five trade union leaders (including UNETE Coordinator Ms Marcela Mspero) were arrested; that Ms Mspero and trade union leader Mr Julio Polanco were injured; and that Ms Mspero, Mr Polanco, Mr Edgar Jimnez, Mr Roberto Ypez and Mr Jos Guilln were taken to Regional Command No. , the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () a group of some  workers blocked the Southern Motorway at Carabobo as a protest action in the hope that their demands in the dispute with the enterprise (situated several kilometres away) would be taken into account, causing harm to hundreds of thousands of people and with a potential loss of hundreds of tonnes of food; () owing to this group s attitude, all mediation attempts by the Bolivarian National Guard using these arguments and others proved fruitless; it was therefore forced to remove the protesters in order to enforce the constitutional right to free passage; as a result of this interruption of the protest action, five people were arrested and released that evening; and that at no time did the National Guard prevent the exercise of the right to strike.
.The Committee observes that the Government has not denied that the demonstration was a peaceful one and notes with regret that it has not replied to the allegation that the Bolivarian National Guard took violent action, injuring union leaders Ms Marcela Mspero and Mr Julio Polanco. The Committee observes that the five trade union leaders and members who were arrested and released on the same day were taken to Regional Command No.  in Carabobo, yet no grounds for filing charges against them were found.
.The Committee regrets the alleged violent action and would like to point out that the intervention of the forces of law and order in trade union demonstrations should be in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and the Government should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence and should not resort to arrests in the absence of clear grounds for filing criminal charges against the demonstrators. Recalling that workers should enjoy the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for these principles.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that intervention of the forces of law and order in trade union demonstrations to defend their occupational interests is in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and to bear in mind that governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence and should not resort to arrests in the absence of clear grounds for filing criminal charges against demonstrators. The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for these principles.(b) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide additional information on the allegations regarding arbitration and interference by the authorities.",0,2014,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
26,".The Committee last examined this case at its May June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent additional observations in communications dated  October  and  September .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, at its May June  session, the Committee made the following recommendations on the questions still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that in future there is no recourse to measures restricting freedom or to injunctions ordering periodic appearances before the judiciary, and banning protests where no grounds have been established for bringing criminal charges against trade unionists who are exercising their right to demonstrate.(b) The Committee requests the Government: () to send a copy of Administrative Decision No. --, whereby the labour inspectorate authorized the dismissal of Mr Ivn Freites, and to specify the offences supposedly committed by this trade union official; and () to indicate whether this trade union official has filed a judicial appeal against his dismissal and, if so, to send a copy of the corresponding ruling.
.In its communications of  October , and  September , the Government sent its observations with regard to the aforementioned recommendations of the Committee.
.Concerning recommendation (a), the Government rejects the allegation that it has banned peaceful protests and demonstrations and has applied judicial measures without clear grounds for doing so. It explains that peaceful protest is a legitimate right enshrined in the country s Constitution and that the State ensures the exercise of this right provided that the protest does not pose a threat to the life or the physical, psychological and emotional safety of the rest of the population or to freedom of movement, public order or national security. The Government recalls that the exercise of civil, political or labour rights cannot be invoked to justify the commission of unlawful acts. It adds that it is the State s responsibility to protect people, property and institutions from unlawful acts committed during violent protests. The Government also states that the police and security forces act in full compliance with the law and that only in the event of unlawful acts against people, offices or property are these forces called upon to fulfil their duty to protect them.
.Concerning recommendation (b), the Government reiterates with regard to the dismissal of the trade union official, Mr Ivn Freites, that the Labour Inspectorate of Punto Fijo, at the request of the enterprise, Petrleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), launched the procedure for establishing misconduct and authorizing his dismissal. The Government again states that the labour inspectorate, in accordance with section  of the Basic Act concerning labour and workers, which specifies various valid reasons for dismissal in the following subsections: (a) lack of integrity or immoral conduct in the workplace; ' (c) serious abuse or lack of respect or consideration due to the employer, his/her representatives or household; ' (i) serious failure to meet the obligations arising from the employment relationship after examining the grounds for dismissal and observing the time frames for bringing evidence in support of the allegations in compliance with the right of defence, decided that the request was admissible and that the enterprise could dismiss Mr Freites. In reply to the Committee s requests, the Government indicates that the offences that prompted the request for authorization to dismiss were: (i) making oral and written statements in the press, on the radio and on television that constituted serious offences and accusations against the self-respect, honour, reputation and decency of the enterprise and its management, thereby impugning their morals, dignity and integrity; and (ii) expressing opinions on technical matters in violation of the enterprise s rules, insulting it and creating turmoil among the people. In that connection, the Government indicates that these acts were verified by the competent bodies and provides the text of Administrative Decision No. --, which authorized the dismissal. The Decision states that Mr Freites' involvement in accusations against his employer and members of its management  without following the usual and proper channels, offending and defaming them by calling them weak, corrupt, murderers and saboteurs' has been demonstrated; it concludes that Mr Freites' actions warrant dismissal pursuant to article (a), (c) and (i) of the Basic Act concerning labour and workers.
.The Government adds that Mr Freites appealed for annulment of the aforementioned Administrative Decision, which was heard by the Fifth Court of First Instance of the Falcn State Labour Circuit Court, and states that it will send the Committee any additional information on the matter that it obtains.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements with regard to recommendation (a) from its previous examination of the case, in which the Committee had requested the Government to ensure that in future there is no recourse to measures restricting freedom or to periodic appearances before the judiciary, or of banning protests where no grounds have been established for bringing criminal charges against trade unionists who are exercising their right to demonstrate. The Committee firmly expects that the Government will ensure that this recommendation is fully implemented.
.The Committee recalls that, in recommendation (b) from its previous examination of the case, it requested the Government to send a copy of the Administrative Decision whereby the labour inspectorate authorized the dismissal of Mr Ivn Freites, to specify the offences supposedly committed by this trade union official, and to send information on any judicial appeal against his dismissal and the outcome thereof. The Committee notes that the Government lists the specific offences of which the trade union leader was accused (serious offences and accusations against self-respect, honour, reputation and decency; and expressing insulting opinions on technical matters in violation of the enterprise s rules) and explains that these offences were verified by the competent bodies. The Committee observes that Administrative Decision No. -- authorized the dismissal of Mr Freites, stating that the trade union leader had been involved in accusations against his employer and members of its management. In that regard, the Committee would like to recall that the full exercise of trade union rights calls for a free flow of information, opinions and ideas, and to this end, workers, employers and their organizations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression at their meetings, in their publications and in the course of other trade union activities. Nevertheless, in expressing their opinions, trade union organizations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee also takes note of the Government s statement that Mr Freites has appealed for annulment of the aforementioned Administrative Decision. The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgment rendered in the appeal.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee firmly expects that the Government will ensure that in future there is no recourse to measures restricting freedom or to injunctions ordering periodic appearances before the judiciary, and banning protests where no grounds have been established for bringing criminal charges against trade unionists who are exercising their right to demonstrate.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the judgment rendered in Mr Freites' appeal for annulment of the Administrative Decision No. --.
.The complaint is contained in two communications dated  February , presented jointly by the following trade union organizations: the National Union of Workers of Venezuela (UNETE), the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CTV), the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), the Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions (CODESA), the Independent Trade Union Alliance (ASI), the Autonomous Front for the Protection of Employment, Wages and Trade Unions (FADESS), the Grassroots Trade Union Movement (MOSBASE) and the Autonomous Revolutionary United Class Movement (C-CURA).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  and  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  February , UNETE, CTV, CGT, CODESA, ASI, FADESS, MOSBASE and C-CURA allege that on  February  a peaceful trade union protest by workers at the Petrleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA) refinery in the city of Puerto La Cruz, state of Anzotegui, was dispersed by the Bolivarian National Guard, who arrested a number of union officials and brought them before the criminal courts.
.According to the allegations, the reasons for the trade union protest were the delay in the conclusion of the new collective labour agreement and the exclusion of the general secretary of the United",0,2014,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
27,"Oil Workers' Federation of Venezuela (FUTPV), Mr Jos Bodas, from the negotiating table. The following nine workers and officials were detained: Mr Endy Alexander Torres Guarema, Mr Moiss Neptali Parica Pinto, Mr Leonardo Rafael Ugarte Rincn, Mr Emiro Jos Milln Gmez, Mr Bladimir Carvajal, Mr Omar David Parica Pinto, Mr Jess Rafael Giraldo Rodrguez, Mr Gustavo Jos Pereira La Rosa and Mr William Eleazar Parica Pinto. All were taken to Regional Command No.  of the Bolivarian National Guard (Regional Command No. ), they were deprived of the use of their mobile phones and were detained until the following day, when they were released, after the Prosecutor-General s Office, through Criminal Prosecutor No.  of the judicial district, charged them, on the basis of sections ,  and  of the Penal Code, with the offences of resisting authority and engaging in coercion to stop work.
.The complainants add that the judicial body handling the case is Criminal Court of Control No. , Criminal Judicial Circuit of the state of Anzotegui, headed by Judge Ydanie Almeida Guevara, who, responding to the request of the Prosecutor-General s Office, ordered the following measures: appearance before the court every  days and a ban on protests, in accordance with section () of the Penal Code.
.The complainants highlight the problem of the criminalization of labour protests in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and point out that the ILO supervisory bodies have repeatedly called for trials against trade union officials to be suspended and for the laws restricting strikes to be repealed.
.In another communication dated  February , the complainants allege that on  November  the dismissal was announced of Mr Ivn Freites, president of the Single Union of Oil, Petrochemical, Gas and Allied Industry Workers of the State of Falcn (SUTPGEF), who brought a complaint before the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association in  against the PDVSA enterprise for violations of Conventions Nos  and  and filed complaints with various national bodies for non-compliance with regulations on working conditions and the working environment. The trade union is basically organized at the Paraguan Refinery Complex (known as the Amuay Refinery, the biggest in the world). More than a year later, the dismissal took place of Mr Ivn Freites, a trade unionist who had denounced the state for failing to honour labour-related commitments, after being excluded from contractual discussions on collective conditions of work by the PDVSA, despite being a member of the executive committee of the FUTPV.
.The complainants indicate that Mr Ivn Freites learned of his dismissal through the publication of a notice by the PDVSA in the local press in the state of Falcn on  December , without having been previously notified by the labour administrative authority. In this way due process was violated in principle and he was unable to avail himself of the administrative and judicial remedies to which he is entitled under national law. On the other hand, the PDVSA arrogated to itself powers which do not belong to it, assuming the role of the labour authority as regards notification, which is totally illegal under Venezuelan law. Furthermore, the action of the labour authority, in clearly favouring the PDVSA by informing it of the content of its decision, shows its lack of independence with respect to the powerful Venezuelan state oil company.
.Moreover, the PDVSA explicitly indicated in the abovementioned notification that it was giving the trade unionist  hours to appear at the Paraguan Refinery Complex for the purpose of implementing the procedures connected with his formal removal from the PDVSA staff payroll. It should be noted that Mr Ivn Freites had completed almost  years of service in the state oil company and that the notification was issued during the period of customary Christmas celebrations that are part of Venezuelan culture, when the PDVSA staff and the general public usually have time off and working hours are reduced. For this reason, it would have been difficult to convene the community of workers to inform them of the arbitrary action that had been committed.
.Lastly, the complainants state that the facts reported in the present complaint constitute a violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.In its communication of  May , the Government states, with regard to the dismissal of trade union official Mr Ivn Freites, that by way of protection of trade union activity in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, no trade union official may be dismissed or transferred without the prior completion of a procedure to verify that there are valid reasons for the dismissal or transfer. The Government indicates that the  Al Primera' Labour Inspectorate of Punto Fijo, at the request of the PDVSA, launched the procedure for establishing misconduct and authorizing the dismissal of Mr Ivn Freites. The labour inspectorate, by Administrative Decision No. -- of  December  and in accordance with section  of the Basic Act concerning labour and workers ' which specifies various valid reasons for dismissal in the following subsections: (a) lack of integrity or immoral conduct in the workplace; (c) serious abuse or lack of respect or consideration due to the employer, his/her representatives or household; ' (i) serious failure to meet the obligations arising from the employment relationship ' after implementing all the corresponding legal procedures, examining the grounds for dismissal and observing the time frames for bringing evidence in support of the allegations in strict compliance with the constitutional right of defence, decided that the request was admissible and that the PDVSA could dismiss the citizen concerned (Mr Ivn Freites) with justification.
.The Government adds that in this decision the Inspectorate of Coro was urged duly to notify Mr Ivn Freites, which was done on  December , as can be seen from the corresponding file. Moreover, the file contains the request for certified copies of the administrative decision and other documents, dated  December  and received by Mr Ivn Freites on  January .
.The Government explains that the decisions of the administrative bodies take effect for the parties once they have been published in the respective file, and it can be seen from this that the enterprise bringing the action was notified of the decision and proceeded to enforce it according to its rights as established by the legislation in force.
.Furthermore, the administrative procedures having been exhausted, the administrative decision indicates that Mr Ivn Freites can appeal to the first-instance labour courts to have this decision declared null and void in the six months following the expiry of the decision deadline in the present proceedings.
.The foregoing shows that neither freedom of association nor due process was violated, since the corresponding legal procedures were followed and the citizen concerned (Mr Ivn Freites) still has the right to avail himself of the legal remedies that he considers relevant.
.In its communication of  October , the Government sent its observations regarding the allegation relating to the exclusion of union official Mr Jos Bodas from the negotiations for the new collective agreement with the PDVSA. The Government states that the negotiations for the collective agreement, which covers more than , workers in the country s main industry, began in November  and were completed in March , proceeding as normal and ending successfully with the signing of the collective agreement. The parties were represented by the PDVSA and the Venezuelan Oil Board for the employers and, for the workers, by the FUTPV, the only representative trade union for the country s oil workers. At the outset of the negotiations, the FUTPV appointed a bargaining committee composed of  persons, which conducted the negotiations on behalf of the FUTPV and the oil workers.
.The Government explains that the composition of the bargaining committee in collective negotiations by the workers is, in accordance with the labour legislation, an autonomous decision of the trade union organizations. Trade union autonomy is protected by the Venezuelan State from any external interference, including from the State itself.
.The complaint expresses the grievance of a member of the FUTPV for not having been appointed to the bargaining committee for the negotiation of the collective agreement for the oil industry. The Government declares that it does not know, and has no wish to know, the reasons why the FUTPV, in full exercise of its trade union autonomy, excluded the citizen concerned (Mr Jos Bodas) from the bargaining committee and included other persons in it.
.The Government adds that Mr Jos Bodas must address these grievances, if they are valid, to the FUTPV and not to the Venezuelan State, which is not and cannot be party to any decisions taken by this or any other trade union organization with respect to the persons due to represent it in collective bargaining.
.The Government reiterates that the negotiations for the oil industry collective agreement went ahead without any delay, dispute or work stoppage.
.However, while the collective bargaining was still in progress, a group of people (some oil industry workers and other individuals involved in local politics) held a  protest' on  February",0,2014,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
28," on the Antonio Jos de Sucre highway, which connects the city of Barcelona and the town of Puerto Piritu in the state of Anzotegui in the east of the country, and in the vicinity of which is located the refinery complex of Jos, one of the biggest in the country.
.The Government adds that the  protest' took place at the right-hand edge of the highway in front of the entrance to the refinery complex without incident until it was time for the change of shifts for the refinery workers. At that moment a group of demonstrators attempted to gain access to the highway to obstruct the free movement of vehicles, including the buses bringing the workers who were due to relieve those finishing their shift at the refinery. This disruption of freedom of movement along one of the main thoroughfares in the east of the country was totally unjustified; it was not called for or supported by the oil workers' unions or by the workers who were working normally at that time or were travelling along the highway to relieve their colleagues.
.In the aforementioned circumstances, the Bolivarian National Guard, being responsible for safeguarding thoroughfares in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, acted promptly to ensure the free movement of vehicles and was obliged to arrest the persons who insisted on obstructing the main road link. The persons arrested were removed from the location and transferred to the nearest Bolivarian National Guard post, before being released the following day. As regards the allegation in writing that the reason for the protest was the delay in concluding the collective agreement and the exclusion of Mr Jos Bodas from the bargaining committee, the Government considers this to be absurd.
.The Government declares that there was never any delay in the collective bargaining (which was completed successfully only weeks later) and that the exclusion of Mr Jos Bodas from the bargaining committee had occurred almost three months earlier and was an internal union matter. Furthermore, in no way could the violent, unilateral closure of a highway used by hundreds of people be considered  peaceful' since it is against the law of Venezuela and many other countries.
.In conclusion, the Government asserts that since this is not a trade union matter, the allegations should be dismissed as ill conceived.
.In its communication of  October , the Government indicates that, according to information sent by the Public Prosecutor s Office dated  October , the case concerning the events that occurred on  February  at the PDVSA refinery headquarters in Puerto La Cruz, state of Anzotegui, relating to trade union officials: Mr Endy Alexander Torres Guarema, Mr Moiss Neptali Parica Pinto, Mr Leonardo Rafael Ugarte Rincn, Mr Emiro Jos Milln Gmez, Mr Bladimir Carvajal, Mr Omar David Parica Pinto, Mr Jess Rafael Giraldo Rodrguez, Mr Gustavo Jos Pereira La Rosa and Mr William Eleazar Parica Pinto, has been concluded and has been ordered to be judicially shelved; accordingly, it was agreed to cancel the related injunction, in accordance with section () of the Basic Code of Criminal Procedure.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the trade union organizations allege the dispersion by the Bolivarian National Guard of a peaceful trade union protest by workers at the PDVSA oil company refinery in the city of Puerto La Cruz on  February , a protest that stemmed from the delay in concluding the new collective agreement and the exclusion of the general secretary of the FUTPV, Mr Jos Bodas, from the negotiating table. The dispersion resulted in the arrest of nine trade union officials or members who were detained until the following day and charged by the Prosecutor General s Office with the criminal offences of resisting authority and engaging in coercion to stop work; according to the allegations, the criminal court adopted injunctions ordering the persons concerned to appear before the court every  days and imposing a ban on protests.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements questioning: () the alleged delay in negotiations (according to the Government, collective bargaining began in November  and went ahead without any delay, dispute or work stoppage and was completed in March  with the signing of the collective agreement between the enterprise and the FUTPV); () the complainants' grievance against the Government concerning the exclusion of the FUTPV general secretary Mr Jos Bodas from the negotiating table (according to the Government, any grievance relating to the exclusion of this trade union official from the bargaining committee should be addressed to the FUTPV, since it is an internal union matter which does not concern the Venezuelan State, which respects this federation s autonomy and is not party to its decisions); () the supposedly peaceful nature of the protest (according to the Government, in no way could the violent, unilateral closure of a highway used by hundreds of people be considered  peaceful' since it is against the law of Venezuela and many other countries). The Committee notes the Government s statement that the  protest'  by a group of oil industry workers and other individuals involved in local politics on the Antonio Jos de Sucre highway in the vicinity of the entrance to the Jos refinery complex, went ahead without incident until it was time for the change of shifts for the refinery workers; at that moment a group of demonstrators attempted to gain access to the highway to obstruct the free movement of vehicles (including the buses bringing the workers who were due to relieve those finishing their shift); this protest and disruption of freedom of movement was not called for or supported by the oil workers' unions. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, when freedom of movement on this highway (one of the main thoroughfares in the east of the country) was disrupted, the Bolivarian National Guard acted to ensure the free movement of vehicles, arrested the persons who insisted on obstructing the highway, and released them the following day ( February ).
.The Committee observes that the Government stated in its last communication that the Public Prosecutor s Office, by an official letter dated  October , approved the lifting of the injunctions and shelved the case concerning the  persons in question.
.In view of the above, since no offence was established on the part of the nine trade unionists who were exercising their right of protest, the Committee is bound to note with regret that they were detained and that injunctions were imposed restricting their trade union rights (ordering their periodic appearance before the judiciary and banning protests) and draws attention to the intimidatory effect of such measures on the exercise of trade union rights. In these circumstances, recalling that workers should enjoy the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ], the Committee requests the Government to ensure that in future there is no recourse to measures restricting freedom or to injunctions ordering periodic appearances before the judiciary and banning protests where no grounds have been established for bringing criminal charges against trade unionists who are exercising their right to demonstrate.
.The Committee notes that, according to the allegations, this trade union official was dismissed after  years of service at the Amuay Refinery on account of his trade union activities, including bringing a complaint before the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association in  relating to violations by the PDVSA enterprise and filing complaints with the national authorities against PDVSA for non-compliance with labour legislation, and denouncing the state for failing to honour labour related commitments, as well as the enterprise s decision to exclude him from the bargaining committee for the collective agreement (despite the fact that he was a member of the executive committee of the oil industry federation that was negotiating). Moreover, according to the complaint, the dismissal was based on a procedure that did not respect due process and involved a lack of independence on the part of the labour administrative authority, including leaving him unable to avail himself of administrative and judicial remedies.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () the enterprise launched the procedure with the labour inspectorate for establishing misconduct and authorizing the dismissal of Mr Ivn Freites and, after following all the legal procedures (including with regard to notification), examining the grounds for dismissal and observing the relevant time frames in strict compliance with the constitutional right of defence, authorized the enterprise to dismiss Mr Ivn Freites on the following legal grounds: (a) lack of integrity or immoral conduct in the workplace; and (b) serious abuse or lack of respect or consideration due to the employer, his/her representatives or household and serious failure to meet the obligations arising from the employment relationship; and () Mr Ivn Freites has the right to appeal to the courts within six months if he considers that his rights have been violated.
.The Committee observes that there",0,2014,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
29,"are contradictions in the versions of the alleged events presented by the complainant and the Government (which denies any violation of due process and the anti-union nature of the dismissal). The Committee notes with regret that the Government has merely referred to the generic grounds for dismissal cited by the enterprise without specifying the offences supposedly committed by this trade union official. Recalling that in a case in which trade union leaders could be dismissed without an indication of the motive, the Committee requested the Government to take steps with a view to punishing acts of anti-union discrimination and to making appeal procedures available to the victims of such acts [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], the Committee, in order to have sufficient information to be able to examine this allegation, requests the Government: () to send a copy of Administrative Decision No. --, whereby the labour inspectorate authorized the dismissal of Mr Ivn Freites, and to specify the offences supposedly committed by this trade union official; and () to indicate whether this trade union official has filed a judicial appeal against his dismissal and, if so, to send a copy of the corresponding ruling.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that in future there is no recourse to measures restricting freedom or to injunctions ordering periodic appearances before the judiciary, and banning protests where no grounds have been established for bringing criminal charges against trade unionists who are exercising their right to demonstrate.(b) The Committee requests the Government: () to send a copy of Administrative Decision No. --, whereby the labour inspectorate authorized the dismissal of Mr Ivn Freites, and to specify the offences supposedly committed by this trade union official; and () to indicate whether this trade union official has filed a judicial appeal against his dismissal and, if so, to send a copy of the corresponding ruling.",1,2014,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
30,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  April  presented by the Union of Workers of Hydrocarbon Derivatives and Related Petrochemicals and Allied Workers in the State of Carabobo (S.T.H.P.C.S.E.C.). The complaint was supported by the Federation of Bolivarian Trade Unions of the State of Carabobo (FUSBEC) in a communication of  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  April , the S.T.H.P.C.S.E.C. alleges that, having obtained registration as a trade union organization on  August , it submitted a draft collective agreement to the labour inspectorate on  January  to be negotiated with the public enterprise, PETROCASA, so that the economic and budgetary study provided for in legislation could be carried out. Since then, the collective bargaining process has not been launched. Since  May , the pretext given by the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour (the complainant trade union attaches a communication with that date) is that  the Commander and President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has intervened so that no ministry, institute, enterprise or foundation of the National Executive is authorized to sign collective agreements'  this  must be dealt with directly with the Commander and President or through the Executive Vice-President of the Republic for approval' 
.The complainant organization also alleges that, as a result of intimidation by the administration, workers have given up their membership, and it attaches a list of workers that appears in a ministry communication dated  August , relating to eight resignations of membership in January . The complainant adds that there were further resignations of members for the same reason in the second half of .
.The complainant also alleges that on  July  it organized a peaceful protest on the company s premises concerning various labour-related irregularities, including the need for wage improvements in the context of a collective agreement, and the suspension of two trade union delegates who cannot perform their duties although they continue to receive their wages.
.The complainant adds that the National Guard attacked the workers during this protest, inflicting blows and broken bones, for which reason criminal proceedings have been brought before the Office of the Public Prosecutor. Since then, entry into the enterprise has been prohibited for numerous workers (a list of  names was sent; the total number of workers in the company is , according to the allegations).
.In a communication dated  May , the Government states, in relation to the commencement of negotiations on the collective labour agreement presented by the complainants, that the draft was accepted and is pending receipt of the mandatory report from the competent authority, so as to meet the economic requirement, in accordance with the Basic Labour Act, so that the commitments made during the negotiation can be honoured. The Government adds that the labour inspectorate of Guacara, State of Carabobo, nevertheless reported that at the many meetings it has held with the workers from the enterprise, they have made no reference to the collective agreement in question.
.With regard to the protection of the suspended workers, the Government reports the decision that they should be reinstated in their posts, without payment of the wages due, as it was clear that the workers had continued to receive their wages.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organization alleges difficulties and delays over a number of years in the collective bargaining process with the enterprise PETROCASA; workers giving up their union membership as a result of intimidation by the enterprise management; the suspension from duty of two workers who were trade union delegates, although they continue to receive their wages; and attacks by the National Guard against workers during a peaceful trade union protest on the premises of the enterprise.
.With regard to the alleged difficulties and excessive delays over a number of years in the collective bargaining process with the enterprise, the Committee notes that the Government states that the draft collective agreement was approved and is pending receipt of the mandatory economic report by the competent authority provided for in the legislation, and also that the local labour inspectorate has reported that the workers have not referred to the collective agreement in the numerous meetings it has held with them.
.The Committee regrets to observe that, according to the allegations, the draft collective agreement was submitted to the labour authorities on  January  precisely so that the corresponding economic report could be prepared and that the process has stalled since then due to instructions making it compulsory for the President or Vice-President of the Republic to give their approval. The Committee observes from the allegations and the information provided by the Government that more than five years later the economic study in question has still not been completed and that collective bargaining has not taken place. The Committee reminds the Government that under Article  of Convention No. , it is under the obligation to promote collective bargaining and firmly requests it to take the necessary measures without delay so that the parties can begin negotiating a collective agreement and to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the allegation relating to workers giving up their trade union membership as a result of intimidation by the management, the Committee notes that the complainant union has presented a list of eight workers that appears in a communication by the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour, dated  August , relating to eight resignations of membership in January , and also that, according to the trade union, there were further resignations of membership for the same reason in the second half of . The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on these allegations. It emphasizes the seriousness of the allegations and requests the Government to conduct an investigation and to keep it informed of the outcome.
.With reference to the allegations relating to the suspension of two trade union delegates who are unable to perform their professional duties, although they continue to receive their wages, the Committee notes the Government s indication that their reinstatement was ordered, and its confirmation, as indicated in the allegations, that they have continued to receive their wages.
.Finally, with regard to the alleged acts of violence by the National Guard (inflicting blows and broken bones) against workers who, according to the complainant union, participated on  July  in a peaceful trade union protest on the premises of the enterprise, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent any information on these allegations. The Committee regrets any acts of violence that may have been committed and observes the indication by the complainant organization that it submitted a criminal complaint to the Office of the Public Prosecutor. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the complaint.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets the excessive delay of more than five years in the collective bargaining process between the complainant trade union and the enterprise due to the failure of the authorities to carry out the economic budgetary study. The Committee reminds the Government that it is under the obligation to promote collective bargaining and firmly requests it to take the necessary measures without delay so that the parties can begin negotiating a collective agreement, and to keep it informed in that regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the criminal complaint presented to the Office of the Public Prosecutor relating to the alleged acts of violence by the National Guard against workers who, according to the complainant trade union, participated on  July  in a peaceful trade union protest on the premises of the enterprise against a number of labour-related irregularities.",0,2013,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
31,".The Committee last examined this case at its October November  meeting, where it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting in October November , the Committee made the following interim recommendations on the allegations presented by the complainant organizations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee urges the Government to promote collective bargaining without delay in the enterprise CEMEX de Venezuela CA.(b)	The Committee urges the Government to take measures to ensure the implementation of the wage clauses of the collective agreement in the enterprise Venezolana de Cementos SACA.(c)	The Committee invites the complainants to indicate whether, after the strike referred to in the allegations, agreements were signed regarding the violations of the collective agreement in the enterprise CA Vencemos.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure full compliance with the collective agreements in the public enterprises in the cement sector.(e)	As regards the union member Mr Manuel Rodriguez (whose wages were allegedly cut in violation of the collective agreement), the union member Mr Alexander Santos (who, according to the allegations, was subjected to a wage cut and harassment), and the union official Mr Ulice Rodrguez (suspension of wages and benefits, on a decision of the enterprise Venezolana de Cementos SACA and the arbitrary reduction of his wages by  per cent in violation of the collective agreement), the Committee regrets that the Government has not informed it of whether the three union members in question did actually file judicial proceedings or of the possible outcomes of any such proceedings. The Committee invites the Government and the complainant organizations to keep it informed in this regard.(f)	Observing that the union organization the UNETE submitted allegations and documents in June and July , according to which Mr Orlando Chirinos was dismissed (following further dismissal proceedings) and the dismissal proceedings against Mr Ulice Rodrguez have been maintained in retaliation for the complaints filed with the ILO high-level tripartite mission in January , the Committee requests the Government to provide, as a matter of urgency, additional information on these allegations and on the grounds for dismissal given in the proceedings under examination concerning the union members Mr Ulice Rodrguez, Mr Jos Vale, Mr Adrin Zerpa and Mr Waldemar Pastor Crawther Snchez, and to keep it informed of the progress of the different proceedings.(g)	The Committee requests the Government to submit these problems to tripartite dialogue with trade union organizations and employers in the cement sector with a view to expediting the identification of effective solutions to the various problems raised in the complaint, and to keep it informed in this regard.
.In its communication of  September , the Government provides its observations on the Committee s recommendations.
.Regarding recommendation (a) (to promote collective bargaining without delay in the enterprise CEMEX de Venezuela CA), the Government informs the Committee that the enterprise changed its name to Venezolana de Cementos SA (hereinafter  cement enterprise No. '  and that there are currently  collective agreements in the cement industry. The Government requests the Committee to ask the complainants for more information regarding the trade unions and enterprises concerned, while reiterating that the Government promotes and guarantees collective bargaining in the cement industry, as in all other sectors.
.Regarding recommendation (b) (measures to ensure the implementation of the wage clauses of the collective agreement in the enterprise Venezolana de Cementos SACA (hereinafter  cement enterprise No. ' , the Government reports that this enterprise informed the Government that it complies with wage clauses and upholds workers' other labour rights. The Government adds that, should there be a violation of collective agreements, the workers can file a complaint with the labour inspectorates, as provided for in law.
.Regarding recommendation (d) (to ensure full compliance with the collective agreements in the public enterprises in the cement sector), the Government states that, in general, it guarantees and monitors compliance with collective agreements in the cement industry, as in all other sectors. The Government adds that all workers in the country have the right to collective bargaining and that legislation provides for mechanisms to settle through conciliation any disputes arising in relation to compliance with collective agreements.
.Regarding recommendation (e) (complaints and judicial proceedings filed by three trade union members), the Government provides the following information:(i)	Mr Ulice Rodrguez referred his case to the labour inspectorate, which decided that the issue should be resolved by judicial process. In the course of these proceedings, the worker alleged that the enterprise had failed to make payments correctly on a number of items, estimating the amount owing to be ,. Venezuelan bolivars (US$, according to the official exchange rate). The Government reports that, on  November , the Eighth High Court of the District Labour Tribunal of the Caracas metropolitan area issued a ruling partially in favour of the complainant and ordered the enterprise to pay the outstanding amounts specified in the ruling.(ii)	With regard to Mr Alexander Santos, the Trujillo State Inspectorate was responsible for handling the procedure for reinstatement and payment of wages due. In , the Inspectorate, in an administrative decision, ruled in favour of the worker. However, the enterprise failed to comply with the decision. With regard to the judicial proceedings, the Government states that there was no way of verifying whether any legal action had been taken by the worker, and therefore asks the Committee to request more information from the complainants.(iii)	With regard to Mr Manuel Rodrguez, no information was received, and the Government therefore requests the Committee to seek more detailed information from the complainants.
.Regarding recommendation (f) (allegations of anti-union dismissal proceedings), the Government denies that trade unions or workers who have lodged complaints with the ILO have been subject to reprisals or any other measures, and states that it respects the free exercise of democracy and freedom of expression. The Government informs the Committee that: (i) with regard to Mr Orlando Chirinos, a ruling was made in favour of the dismissal proceedings on  June , but the worker may appeal against this decision in the courts; (ii) with regard to Mr Pastor Crawther, the charges of misconduct invoked as a reason to authorize his dismissal were declared inadmissible and the dismissal was therefore not authorized; (iii) with regard to Mr Adrin Zerpa, the proceedings were withdrawn by the enterprise, closing the case in question; (iv) with regard to Mr Ulice Rodrguez, the labour inspectorates reported that there were currently no active dismissal proceedings; and (v) with regard to Mr Jos Vale, following an exhaustive review of inspectorate records, no proceedings against him were found.
.Regarding recommendation (g) (to submit these problems to tripartite dialogue in the cement sector), the Government indicates that, as is the customary practice in the country, labour inspectorates have set up round tables for bargaining, dialogue and conciliation between trade union organizations and enterprises in the cement industry and other sectors. The Government, for example, refers to a dialogue round table set up in the offices of the Lara State Labour Inspectorate, Pio Tamayo, between cement enterprise No.  (Planta Lara) and the Union of Cement Workers in Lara State (SINTRACEL).
.Lastly, the Government draws attention to the complainants' failure to provide the information requested on several occasions, as well as the lack of willingness by the complainants to move forward with the complaint, and asks that the case be closed.
.The Committee observes that, concerning recommendations (a), (b),( d) and (g) regarding the promotion of collective bargaining, tripartite dialogue and respect for collective agreements in the cement industry, the Government provides general information. In particular, regarding the promotion of collective bargaining without delay in cement enterprise No. , the Government reiterates its commitment to collective bargaining and requests more details from the complainants to enable it to reply ' without providing further information on any negotiating tables set up and agreements concluded. In addition, regarding the recommendation to take measures to ensure that the clauses of the collective agreements, particularly the wage clauses of the collective agreement with cement enterprise No. , are implemented, the Government reports that the enterprise concerned claims that it is complying with wage clauses and upholds other labour rights and recalls that the workers can file complaints about non-compliance with collective agreements. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the complainants have not provided any additional information for more than three years. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to provide more detailed information concerning recommendations (a), (b),(d) and (g) of its previous examination of the case, regarding the promotion of collective bargaining, tripartite dialogue and respect for collective agreements in the cement industry. Furthermore, it invites the Government to address all outstanding matters relating to these issues by setting up a dialogue round table with",0,2013,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
32,"the interested organizations, and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard, as well as of the number and coverage of agreements concluded in the enterprises concerned.
.Regarding recommendation (c), the Committee observes that the complainants have failed to provide the information requested of them and, given the time that has elapsed, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this aspect of the case.
.Regarding recommendation (e), in which the Committee had requested the Government and the complainants to provide information on the complaints and judicial proceedings filed by the three trade union members, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government: a legal ruling partially in favour of Mr Ulice Rodrguez in his complaints relating to incorrect amounts paid by the enterprise; and an administrative decision in favour of Mr Alexander Santos regarding reinstatement and payment of wages due. However, as the enterprise failed to comply with the decision, there is no way of verifying whether any subsequent legal action had been taken, and it has not been possible to obtain any information relating to Mr Manuel Rodrguez. As no additional information has been received from the complainants, the Committee once again invites them to provide any detailed information at their disposal and requests the Government, on the basis of that information, to state whether Mr Alexander Santos and Mr Manuel Rodrguez did actually file judicial proceedings and to provide information on the outcome of such proceedings, and to provide a copy of the court decision ruling partially in favour of Mr Ulice Rodrguez.
.Regarding recommendation (f) (allegations of anti-union dismissal proceedings), the Committee observes that the Government reports that, in four of the five alleged cases, the dismissal proceedings were unsuccessful or did not take place. With regard to the only case in which dismissal was authorized (Mr Orlando Chirinos), the Committee observes that the application for dismissal was declared admissible, given the prior authorization by the labour inspectorate on the grounds of an allegation (dereliction of duty) that is unchallenged by the complainants. As no additional information has been received from the complainants in this regard, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee urges the Government to provide more detailed information concerning recommendations (a), (b),(d) and (g) of its previous examination of the case, regarding the promotion of collective bargaining, tripartite dialogue and respect for collective agreements in the cement industry. Furthermore, it invites the Government to address all outstanding matters relating to these issues by setting up a dialogue round table with the interested organizations, and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard, as well as of the number and coverage of agreements concluded in the enterprises concerned.(b)	The Committee once again invites the complainant organizations to provide any detailed information at their disposal and requests the Government, on the basis of that information, to state whether Mr Alexander Santos and Mr Manuel Rodrguez did actually file judicial proceedings and to provide information on the outcome of such proceedings, and to provide a copy of the court decision ruling partially in favour of Mr Ulice Rodrguez.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see st Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th meeting (March )].
.Previously, the National Union of Workers of Venezuela (UNETE) sent communications dated  June and  July , related to the questions raised by this case.
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  May and  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the pending issues [see st Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to take measures in consultation with the most representative trade unions and employers' organizations to promote collective bargaining in the cement sector (according to the allegations,  collective agreements have expired and have not been renegotiated) and, in view of the excessive delays that it has found, to expedite disciplinary administrative proceedings in the event of repeated non-compliance with collective agreements, and it requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to send a detailed reply without delay on the allegations referred to in the conclusions.
.As regards recommendation (b), the Committee referred to the following allegations [see st Report, para. ]:?the allegation presented by SITRAMCT regarding its Secretary-General, Mr Jess Eliecer Martnez Surez, reporting that the Ministry of Science and Technology had not paid his evaluation-based wage increase and bonus, in violation of the collective agreement in force; non-compliance with clauses in collective agreements in the following cases: () as regards a number of clauses in the collective agreement between the enterprise CA Vencemos in Catia La Mar and SINTUECAV; and () the collective labour agreement of the ready-mix sector enterprise Cemex Venezuela, SACA, in the capital district, and SINTUECAV, for the period  May  to  May  (currently in force as no other collective agreement has been discussed) as regards union dues and allowances;?the suspension of part of the wages and benefits of the Secretary-General of SINTUECAV, Mr Ulice Rodrguez, which had been paid from  to , on a decision of the public management of Venezolana de Cementos SACA, which, in May , arbitrarily cut his wages by nearly  per cent, in violation of the collective agreement (according to the allegations, the executive committees of SINTUECAV, ANTRACEM and UNETE have submitted complaints to the enterprise through the labour inspectorate, the labour courts and other institutions, without securing the restoration of the union official s rights on the pretext that SINTUECAV s executive committee was allegedly in a situation of electoral default);?charges for misconduct were brought against the union official, Mr Jos Vale, the records and correspondence secretary, on  February  (on  January  an extraordinary assembly had been held to discuss the enterprise s violation of the collective labour agreement and its failure to provide a reply after the four meetings held between October  and January ; the assembly decided that it would remain in statutory assembly until the enterprise resolved the dispute);?the wages of Mr Manuel Rodrguez were also cut on  November , in violation of clause No.  of the collective labour agreement (basic wage or daily rate increases), and having declared itself incompetent to hear the claims the labour inspectorate invited the worker to file his claim before the courts;?in Lara State, on  April , the enterprise filed charges for misconduct before the labour inspectorate against the union official Mr Orlando Chirinos, organization secretary of SINTRACEL and leading member of ANTRACEM, in violation of the collective labour agreement. It also filed charges for misconduct against the workers Mr Waldemar Pastor Crawther Snchez and Mr Eduardo Adrin Zerpa, both members of SINTRACEL and ANTRACEM, violating the collective labour agreement and dated  May  and  February , respectively;?in Trujillo State, Mr Alexander Enrique Santos Mendoza was subjected to degradation of his employment conditions, persecution and harassment, and the ruling in his favour by the labour inspectorate of Valera in Trujillo State, was held in contempt by the management of Cemento Andino and Corporacin Socialista de Cemento.
.In its previous report, the Committee observed that the picture that emerges from the allegations and from the Government s reply ' which only addresses some of those allegations ' is that administrative proceedings are very slow; they are at times blocked in institutions such as the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic; and many of them affect union officials. It observes, moreover, that no evidence is provided of sanctions for failure to comply with collective agreements [see st Report, para. ].
.In communications dated  June and  July , the UNETE alleges that the enterprise Venezolana de Cementos SACA: () has continued its dismissal procedure against the union official Ulice Rodrguez, threatening him with imprisonment; () has dismissed union official Orlando Chirinos; and () refuses to register a list of claims for non-compliance with the collective agreement. The UNETE associates these actions with the complaints filed by the aforementioned officials and notified to the high-level tripartite mission in January . Furthermore, the UNETE reports new instances of non-compliance with collective agreements.
.In its communication of  May , the Government indicates that, with regard to collective bargaining in the cement sector (according to the complainants' allegations,  collective agreements in that sector have expired and have not been renegotiated), a review found that only nine draft collective agreements have been submitted by the various trade union organizations before the corresponding administrative body. Of these, three were duly dismissed on the grounds that they did not meet the",1,2013,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
33,"legal requirements; the others are pending the completion of the nationalization process for the enterprise CEMEX de Venezuela CA, which will be integrated into the consortium Cementos Mexicanos SBD. However, in order to avoid delays in collective bargaining due to the legal status of the enterprise, in November  a round table was organized with trade union representatives in order to review the benefits of the collective agreement, which remains in force in all the cement production plants of this enterprise. Accordingly, until the legal and administrative conditions of the purchase are established with regard to the transition of an enterprise in the private sector to the public sector, which is governed by different procedures, the State cannot begin discussions of the aforementioned draft collective labour agreements. However, the Government has organized several round tables and the parties have proposed some agreements. The Government indicates that ANTRACEM is not a legitimate trade union organization, but a political organization, according to the principle of freedom of association established by the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and that some of its members are also members of the executive committees of trade union organizations. As officials of those trade union organizations, ANTRACEM members participate in collective bargaining, but as an organization, ANTRACEM cannot put forward draft collective agreements or act in representation of cement factory workers.
.Regarding the allegation concerning the Secretary-General of SITRAMCT, Mr Jess Eliecer Martnez Surez, reporting that the Ministry of Science and Technology had not paid his evaluation-based wage increase and bonus, in violation of the collective agreement in force, the Government indicates that the Labour Act establishes the mechanism and procedures of the administrative labour bodies, allowing workers to submit claims when they consider that their rights have been violated. A review indicated that the complainants filed the corresponding proceedings (collective claim) with the labour inspectorate, and that this was duly registered. The last recorded action was taken on  November , when the parties failed to attend a scheduled conciliation meeting, despite due notification, and an appropriate report was filed. The complainants, on whom it was incumbent, have to date not sent a new invitation to the defendant, and so this failure to attend has been taken as an indication of lack of interest in the reactivation of the respective proceedings.
.As regards the Single Union of United Workers of the Company CA Vencemos (SINTUECAV), the Government reports that, on  October , a request for collective conciliation proceedings was filed with the labour inspectorate of Miranda-Este by SINTUECAV, which represented a group of  workers, for five alleged violations of the law. The inspectorate registered the claims on  October  and meetings began on  November, with more than  conciliation meetings being held between the employer representatives and the workers. On  October , a meeting was held between the parties to the conciliation proceedings at which the employer representative indicated that the points set out in the workers' claims had been addressed and that the collective labour agreement was in turn being applied. However, at that same meeting, the workers indicated that they were not in agreement and that they therefore wished to file a list of claims and exercise the right to strike. Consequently, the trade union confirmed in writing its request to change their claims under the collective conciliation procedure to a list of grievances. Given that full conciliation had not been achieved and in view of the trade union s request to present a list of grievances, once it had examined the case, the labour inspectorate closed the proceedings on the grounds that conciliatory proceedings cannot be changed to a grievance procedure, notifying the union in this regard on  January .
.As regards the Secretary-General of SINTUECAV, Mr Ulice Rodrguez, on  August  a complaint was filed with the labour inspectorate of the State of Vargas and it was registered on  August . The administrative proceedings were closed and, on  November , the workers (including Mr Ulice Rodrguez) decided to file their complaint before the labour courts, exhausting the administrative channels and receiving the relevant ruling. The records of the labour inspectorate contain no further information relating to this person.
.As regards the charges for misconduct brought against the union official Mr Jos Vale, the Government indicates that Venezuelan legislation guarantees comprehensive protection for the employment stability and against the dismissal of union officials under trade union immunity.
.Section  of the Labour Act lays down the procedure for the authorization of justified dismissals, transfers and modifications to the working conditions of workers entitled to trade union immunity:  Where an employer seeks to dismiss for good reason a worker enjoying trade union immunity, transfer him or her from their post or modify their conditions of work, it must request the corresponding authorization from the labour inspector, within  days following the date on which the worker committed the act of misconduct given as the grounds for dismissal, or the reason for transfer or the modification to the conditions of work under the procedure in question.' Accordingly, initiating proceedings does not alone constitute a violation of the collective agreement referred to by the complainant, since the proceedings indicate the steps which an employer seeking to dismiss a worker must take to apply to the administrative authorities. Furthermore, once due process and the equality of the parties have been guaranteed, a decision is to be taken on the basis of the allegations and evidence, in accordance with the labour legislation in force.
.Regarding the complaint filed by Mr Manuel Rodrguez, it was examined and ruled upon by the corresponding administrative authority, which declared itself incompetent to hear claims relating to a point of law and indicated that the complaint should be brought before and ruled on by the courts. Accordingly, the Government urges the Committee on Freedom of Association to advise the complainant to file its complaint through the corresponding channel.
.As regards the grounds for the dismissal of Mr Orlando Chirinos, Secretary of SINTRACEL, Mr Waldemar Pastor Crawther Snchez, member of SINTRACEL, and Mr Eduardo Adrin Zerpa, member of SINTRACEL, the Government reiterates that Venezuelan legislation provides comprehensive protection for employment stability and against the dismissal of trade union officials under trade union jurisdiction.
.Section  of the Labour Act establishes the procedure for authorization of the justified dismissal, transfer and modification to working conditions of workers entitled to trade union immunity. The Government refers in this regard to the information concerning the case of the union official Mr Jos Vale.
.As regards the case of the worker Mr Alexander Santos, the Government reports that all administrative channels have been exhausted, as a result of a decision in favour of this worker. The complainant may file judicial proceedings, which is the channel available once all administrative remedies have been exhausted.
.Lastly, in its communication of  October , the Government indicates its willingness to send additional information, if necessary, regarding the allegations made by the UNETE, considering that it already sent information in its previous communication.
.The Committee observes that the allegations still pending refer to difficulties in collective bargaining on various collective agreements in the cement sector or in their application, as well as the initiation of proceedings for the dismissal of trade union officials.
.As regards the allegations according to which more than  collective agreements in the cement sector had expired and had not been renegotiated, the Committee takes note of the observations made by the Government, according to which only nine new draft collective agreements have been submitted by trade union organizations. Of these, three were duly dismissed on the grounds that they did not meet the legal requirements (the Government does not, however, indicate which ones). As regards the six remaining draft collective agreements, the Committee notes that the Government reports that the negotiation of these collective agreements cannot be carried out because it is pending the transfer of a private enterprise into the public domain. These two sectors have different processing procedures and the legal and administrative conditions of nationalization also need to be established. The Government adds that, notwithstanding the above, in  a round table was organized with the trade unions in order to review the benefits of the collective agreement in force, and that round tables have achieved some agreements between the parties.
.The Committee highlights the vagueness of the expression  some agreements' used by the Government and considers that the situation described by the Government impinges upon the exercise of collective bargaining in the enterprise CEMEX de Venezuela CA. It cannot but express concern at the Government s line of argument, which makes the negotiation of six draft collective agreements in this sector conditional on the establishment of the legal and administrative conditions for the acquisition of the enterprise Cementos Mexicanos SBD by CEMEX de Venezuela CA, a process that has been delayed for a number of years. The Committee urges the Government to promote collective bargaining without delay in the latter enterprise.
.On the other hand,",0,2013,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
34,"the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that the public management of the enterprise Venezolana de Cementos SACA arbitrarily decreased the wages of workers by  per cent in violation of the collective agreement. The Committee considers that the unilateral decrease of the wages of workers by  per cent in violation of the collective agreement constitutes a serious infringement of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. In these conditions, the Committee urges the Government to take measures to ensure the implementation of the wage clauses of the collective agreement in the enterprise.
.As regards the alleged non-compliance with the collective agreement by the enterprise CA Vencemos, the Committee notes that the Government declares that the trade union representing  workers reported the violation of the collective agreement; that  conciliation meetings were held in Catia La Mar and in the capital district before the labour authorities; and that, on  October , the trade union decided to resort to strike action, whereby the administrative proceedings were concluded. The Committee invites the complainants to indicate whether, after the strike, agreements were signed in respect of the violations of the collective agreement in this enterprise.
.In general, taking into account the conclusions in the paragraphs above, the Committee draws to the attention of the Government the principle whereby mutual respect of the commitment undertaken is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ] and that agreements should be binding on the parties [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure full compliance with the collective agreements in the public enterprises in the cement sector.
.As regards the union member Mr Manuel Rodrguez, whose wages were, according to the allegations, cut in violation of the collective agreement, the Committee observes that in its previous reply, the Government reported that the labour authorities disqualified themselves and that its last reply suggested that this occurred because the case concerned a point of law, whereby the trade union member was invited to initiate judicial proceedings. As regards the union member Mr Alexander Santos, who according to the allegations was subjected to a wage cut and harassment and had obtained a ruling in his favour from the labour inspectorate, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that, having exhausted the administrative channels, the complainant may file judicial proceedings. As regards the allegations concerning the union official Mr Ulice Rodrguez (suspension of wages and benefits, on a decision of the public management of Venezolana de Cementos SACA, and the arbitrary reduction of his wages by  per cent in violation of the collective agreement), the Committee notes that the Government reports that, after various cases of arbitrary proceedings were brought before the labour inspectorate in the State of Vargas, on  November , the complainant decided to file the complaint before the courts. The Committee regrets that the Government has not informed it of whether the three union members in question did actually file judicial proceedings or of the possible outcome of any such proceedings. The Committee invites the Government and the complainant organizations to keep it informed in this regard.
.As regards the alleged charges for misconduct brought against the union officials Mr Jos Vale and Mr Orlando Chirinos, and the union members Mr Adrin Zerpa and Mr Waldemar Pastor Crawther Snchez, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the legislation provides comprehensive protection of employment stability and trade union immunity, requiring a justified reason for dismissal. Accordingly, authorization for dismissal requires an authorization by the labour inspector, whereby initiating the procedure to request an authorization to dismiss does not, alone, constitute a violation of the collective agreement. The Committee notes that the union organization UNETE submitted allegations and documents in June and July , according to which Mr Orlando Chirinos was dismissed (following further proceedings on charges of misconduct) and the dismissal proceedings against Mr Ulice Rodrguez have been maintained in retaliation for the complaints filed with the ILO high-level tripartite mission in January . The Committee recalls that no one should be subjected to discrimination or prejudice with regard to employment because of legitimate trade union activities or membership, and the persons responsible for such acts should be punished [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to provide, as a matter of urgency, observations on these allegations and on the grounds for dismissal given in the proceedings under examination concerning the aforementioned union members, and to keep it informed of the progress of the proceedings.
.In general, the Committee reiterates and highlights that the picture that emerges is that administrative proceedings for non-compliance with collective agreements, including in the case of clauses protecting union members and workers against dismissal, are slow and ineffective and that the Government has provided no information regarding any administrative sanctions for non-compliance with the clauses of collective agreements, and simply points to the right of the interested parties to file judicial proceedings. This is, in the Committee s opinion, highly unsatisfactory given that the original complaint was filed in .
.The Committee requests the Government to submit these problems to tripartite dialogue with trade union organizations and employers in the cement sector with a view to expediting the identification of effective solutions to the various problems raised in the complaint, and to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee urges the Government to promote collective bargaining without delay in the enterprise CEMEX de Venezuela CA.(b)	The Committee urges the Government to take measures to ensure the implementation of the wage clauses of the collective agreement in the enterprise Venezolana de Cementos SACA.(c)	The Committee invites the complainants to indicate whether, after the strike referred to in the allegations, agreements were signed regarding the violations of the collective agreement in the enterprise CA Vencemos.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure full compliance with the collective agreements in the public enterprises in the cement sector.(e)	As regards the union member Mr Manuel Rodriguez (whose wages were allegedly cut in violation of the collective agreement), the union member Mr Alexander Santos (who, according to the allegations, was subjected to a wage cut and harassment), and the union official Mr Ulice Rodrguez (suspension of wages and benefits, on a decision of the enterprise Venezolana de Cementos SACA and the arbitrary reduction of his wages by  per cent in violation of the collective agreement), the Committee regrets that the Government has not informed it of whether the three union members in question did actually file judicial proceedings or of the possible outcomes of any such proceedings. The Committee invites the Government and the complainant organizations to keep it informed in this regard.(f)	Observing that the union organization the UNETE submitted allegations and documents in June and July , according to which Mr Orlando Chirinos was dismissed (following further dismissal proceedings) and the dismissal proceedings against Mr Ulice Rodrguez have been maintained in retaliation for the complaints filed with the ILO high-level tripartite mission in January , the Committee requests the Government to provide, as a matter of urgency, additional information on these allegations and on the grounds for dismissal given in the proceedings under examination concerning the union members Mr Ulice Rodrguez, Mr Jos Vale, Mr Adrin Zerpa and Mr Waldemar Pastor Crawther Snchez, and to keep it informed of the progress of the different proceedings.(g)	The Committee requests the Government to submit these problems to tripartite dialogue with trade union organizations and employers in the cement sector with a view to expediting the identification of effective solutions to the various problems raised in the complaint, and to keep it informed in this regard.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  March  and in another communication of March  presented by the Union of Workers of the Ministry of Science and Technology (SITRAMCT) and by the National Alliance of Cement Workers (ANTRACEM), respectively.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  March , SITRAMCT alleges that its Secretary General, Mr Jess Elicer Martnez Surez, is being subjected to persecution, degraded employment conditions and harassment, and that complaints in this regard have been filed with the labour inspectorate of the municipality of Libertador, northern sector, and with the different bodies of the Ministry of Science and Technology itself, without eliciting a response. According to the allegations, this comes as a result of industrial action to counteract moves to deprive workers of rights acquired under collective agreements.
.This complainant organization alleges non-compliance with clauses in",-1,2013,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
35,"the agreements of  October  as regards performance and productivity evaluations and corresponding evaluation-based wage increases or bonuses, to the detriment of the abovementioned Secretary-General. This has occurred after  years of continuous evaluation in which no objections have been made against him. Likewise, the evaluation-based wage increase, regulated by the framework agreement for public workers, ' , and by the worker productivity evaluation manual (to be allocated according to the following scale:  per cent for workers with two consecutive excellent evaluations,  per cent for workers with a very good evaluation, and  per cent for workers with a good evaluation), was progressively curtailed until it was annulled. The employer claimed that this degradation in employment conditions resulted from the implementation of regulations issued by the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Labour.
.In its communication of March , ANTRACEM explains that the Venezuelan cement industry was nationalized in , guaranteeing job security for all workers currently in employment and compliance with collective agreements. However, the organization indicates that some  different collective agreements expired more than four years ago. Nationalization has given rise to contractual, labour and even human rights violations, which have been reported to the Venezuelan authorities, through different State bodies (Ministry of Labour, the inspectorate, etc.) and courts, without eliciting a response.
.More specifically, ANTRACEM mentions the situation of the United Workers Union of the enterprise C.A. Vencemos in the metropolitan district (SINTUECAV), and alleges non compliance with provisions of collective agreements in the following cases:. the collective agreement signed between the enterprise C.A. Vencemos in Catia La Mar and SINTUECAV, for the period  December  to  December  (currently still in force as no other collective agreement has been discussed). There is failure to comply with the provisions regarding monthly union contributions; union fee deductions; meals; expenses; work on public holidays and rest days; cargo transport workers' day; backhaul trips; detours; tank offloading assistance; delay compensation paid by the enterprise to drivers when, for reasons outside their control, they are obliged to wait at the off-loading site for more than three hours; holidays; grants for workers' children; wage increases for stationary staff; overtime and night pay for stationary staff; school materials; and childbirth bonus and leave; and. the collective labour agreement (for the period ' , currently still in force as no other agreement has been signed) between the ready-mix enterprise CEMEX Venezuela S.A.C.A. capital district, and SINTUECAV, as regards the clauses relating to trade union dues, Sunday or compulsory weekly rest-day pay, productivity bonuses (concrete plants), the Araguita sand quarry productivity bonus, meals, travel planning, basic wage or daily rate increases and holidays.
.ANTRACEM highlights that its complaints have been submitted to the administrative and judicial authorities and to conciliation, without eliciting any reply. A collective claim was filed on  October  before the labour inspectorate of capital district, eastern sector, and eight meetings were held to discuss the claim. In the records of those meetings, dates were mentioned for future meetings only between the parties, but the enterprise decided not to hold these.
.In the meeting of  June , a decision was taken by mutual accord ' as stated in the record ' to cancel outstanding payments and the enterprise indicated that it would pay all its debts on  August , requesting  days to ensure full adherence to the agreements. On that occasion, the enterprise alluded to another meeting between the parties outside the labour inspectorate ten days later, but this never took place. There was no subsequent change in the enterprise s attitude and the union went on strike.
.ANTRACEM also alleges a violation of freedom of association affecting the Secretary General of SINTUECAV, Mr Ulice Rodrguez, part of whose wages and benefits (paid from  to ) were suspended on the decision of the public management of Venezolana de Cementos S.A.C.A. which, in May , arbitrarily cut his wages by nearly  per cent, in violation of the collective agreement. The executive committees of SINTUECAV, ANTRACEM and the National Union of Workers of Venezuela (UNETE) filed complaints against the enterprise, through the labour inspectorate, labour courts and other institutions, without the union official s rights being restored on the pretext that SINTUECAV s executive committee was allegedly in electoral default.
.Furthermore, charges for misconduct were brought against the union official, Mr Jos Vale, the records and correspondence secretary, on  February . ANTRACEM explains that an extraordinary assembly was held on  January  to discuss the enterprise s violation of the collective labour agreement, even after the four meetings held between October  and January . The assembly decided that it would remain in statutory assembly until the enterprise resolved the dispute.
.In addition, on  November , Mr Manuel Rodrguez was given a pay cut, which violated clause No.  of the collective agreement (basic wage or daily rate increases). The labour inspectorate ruled itself incompetent to hear the claim and invited the worker to file his claim before the courts.
.As regards the Union of Cement Workers of Anzotegui State (SINTRACEA), which brings together the enterprise s workers in the production, transport and concrete sector of the States of Anzotegui, Monagas, Sucre and Nueva Esparta, ANTRACEM alleges that the State bodies responsible for protecting labour rights, such as the Health Directorate for Workers in the States of Anzotegui, Sucre and Nueva Esparta, attached to the National Institute for Occupational Prevention, Health and Safety (INPSASEL), and to the labour inspectorate, have ignored the complaints submitted for violations of safety and environmental regulations, which have opened the door to occupational accidents and diseases; it has repeatedly disregarded the union s executive committee, in open violation of freedom of association, and has demonstrated ongoing contempt of the decisions issued by the labour inspectorate despite its position as the State authority on labour issues. Moreover, workers have been transferred arbitrarily and illegally to positions that they did not previously occupy, in violation of the collective agreement, and other workers have suffered unjustified dismissals. Fifteen claims presented by SINTRACEA and the workers for the violation of the collective agreement are currently being examined by the labour inspectorate of Puerto la Cruz, in Anzotegui State.
.As regards the Union of Lara State Cement Workers (SINTRACEL) (a trade union for the enterprise s workers in production, transport and concrete centres in the States of Lara and Portuguesa), this Venezuelan enterprise filed charges for misconduct before the labour inspectorate against the union official, Mr Orlando Chirinos, union secretary and leading member of ANTRACEM, dated  April , in violation of the collective labour agreement. It also filed charges for misconduct against Mr Waldemar Pastor Crawther Snchez and Mr Eduardo Adrin Zerpa, both members of SINTRACEL and ANTRACEM, violating the collective labour agreement and dated  May  and  February , respectively.
.In Trujillo State, Mr Alexander Santos was subjected to degradation of his employment conditions, persecution and harassment, and the ruling in his favour by the labour inspectorate of Valera in Trujillo State was held in contempt by the management of Cemento Andino and Corporacin Socialista de Cemento.
.In its communication of  October , the Government addresses the allegations presented by ANTRACEM and SITRAMCT, regarding the alleged violation of clauses in the collective agreement for the cement industry; violation of constitutional and labour regulations, the public service collective framework agreement and contractual benefits of a number of workers listed therein. As regards Case No. --- of  November , submitted by SINTUECAV to the labour inspectorate of the capital district, eastern sector, alleging the violation of clauses in the collective agreement, the Government reports that a collective claim was submitted on  October  against what is now Venezolana de Cementos SACA. by a group of  workers for different alleged violations by the employer. It should be noted that the complaints were not submitted in a list of claims, but as collective claims clearly within the definition of conciliation proceedings established in the Labour Act that has now been repealed. As such, meetings were held between the parties on  November ,  December ,  January ,  February ,  March ,  April ,  May ,  June ,  June  and  October , given that, as previously indicated, the aforementioned complaints were not submitted as a list of claims, but as a collective claim under conciliation.
.Having failed to achieve full conciliation in relation to the claims submitted, and considering that, at the last meeting, the union representation submitted a written document indicating that it would draw up a list of claims in accordance with sections , , , , ,  and  of the Labour Act, and would exercise its right to strike, the labour inspectorate, under a ruling of  October , in view of the failure to achieve conciliation, closed and filed the case in terms of the conciliation procedure. It should also be noted that during the conciliation meetings, the initial grounds for",0,2013,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
36,"the claim were modified, thereafter constituting grounds which should be dealt with under a list of claims rather than as a collective claim.
.The Government adds that an examination of the registry of submissions to the Chamber of Collective Rights of the abovementioned inspectorate found that from  October  to date, the trade union has neither submitted a request for conciliation proceedings nor has it filed a list of claims to notify the employer of its failure to comply with the collective agreement.
.As regards the charges for misconduct under Cases Nos --- and ---, filed before the Pio Tamayo Labour Inspectorate, mid-western sector, the Government indicates that the enterprise filed the charges against Mr Eduardo Zerpa and Mr Waldemar Pastor Crawther Snchez.

.As regards the complaint for degraded employment conditions presented by Mr Alexander Enrique Santos Mendoza against the enterprise Cemento Andino, SA, Case No.  --, before the labour inspectorate of Trujillo State, at its Trujillo office, the Government states that the worker submitted the complaint on  November , requesting that his working hours be restored (in rotating shifts), as they had been changed. This claim of degraded employment conditions was duly substantiated and endorsed by the inspectorate on  February , and an administrative ruling upheld the proceedings and ordered the reinstatement of the worker to his previous position. The administrative ruling was implemented on  May . The inspectorate indicates that there are no further actions pending.
.As regards the following cases: Mr Juan Manosalva, Case No. ---; Mr Henry Cardozo, Case No. --; Mr Manuel Rivas, Case No. ---; Mr Hctor Puesme, Case No. ---; Mr Miguel Gutirrez, Case No. ---; Mr Belmar Andarcia, Case No. ---; Mr scar Rivero, Case No. ---; Mr Diego Tadeo, Case No. ---; Mr Jos Gmez, Case No. ---; Mr Gregory Vallenilla, Case No. ---; Mr Jos Rivas, Case No. ---; and Mr Orlando Prez, Case No. ---, requesting the restoration of their infringed (in terms of degraded conditions) legal position, before the  Alberto Lovera' labour inspectorate, at its Barcelona office, the Government indicates that this case concerns a complaint requesting the restoration of infringed legal conditions against the employer Venezolana de Cementos S.A.C.A. This case was received by the corresponding inspectorate on  September . The Chief Labour Inspector heard the case and submitted a report to the administration of the north-eastern sector and to the Office of the Prosecutor for Labour, in order to address some of the omissions in the workers' complaints, to enable the corresponding admission procedure, in conformity with the provisions of section  of the LOTT. On  September , the workers from that enterprise, clearly identified above, appeared before the inspectorate and engaged in dialogue, during which the corrections that needed to be made to the complaints for their admission and continuation of the proceedings were explained to them. The corrections included providing the correct name of the enterprise in which they provide their services, indicating that they had been transferred, and giving details of their place of transfer.
.As regards Case No. ---, in relation to clauses in the collective agreement, submitted by Mr Luis Alfredo Chaparro Bello before the labour inspectorate of Puerto la Cruz, the Government states that the proceedings began on  March  on a request by Mr Luis Chaparro, in his capacity as the Secretary-General of SINTRACEA, against the aforementioned enterprise (on  December , SINTRACEA had signed a collective agreement with the enterprise to regulate labour relations between the employer and its employees, for a period of three years, until  December ). After the start of these proceedings, the case was referred to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on  July , and is currently pending a decision on its admissibility, before proceeding to the corresponding grievance hearing.
.As regards Case No. ---, in relation to non-compliance with contractual clauses, submitted by Mr Luis Alfredo Chaparro Bello and Mr Luis Jos Guerra Martnez, before the labour inspectorate of Puerto la Cruz, the Government states that the proceedings began on  January  on a request by the aforementioned individuals, in their respective capacities as Secretary-General and correspondence secretary of SINTRACEA, against the employer Venezolana de Cementos S.A.C.A. (on  December , SINTRACEA signed a collective agreement with the enterprise to regulate labour relations between the employer and its employees, for a period of three years, until  December ). After the case was accepted by the inspectorate on  January , it was referred to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on  February , and is currently pending a decision on its admissibility, before proceeding to the corresponding grievance hearing.
.As regards Case No. ---, in relation to clauses in the collective agreement, presented by Mr Luis Alfredo Chaparro Bello, before the labour inspectorate of Puerto la Cruz, the Government states that the proceedings began on  March  on a request by Mr Luis Chaparro Bello, in his capacity as Secretary General of SINTRACEA, against the enterprise (on  December , SINTRACEA signed a collective agreement with the enterprise to regulate labour relations between the employer and its employees, for a period of three years, until  December ). After the case was accepted by the inspectorate on  July , it was referred to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and is currently pending a decision on its admissibility, before proceeding to the corresponding grievance hearing.
.The Government states that, as indicated above, the respective labour inspectorates, in keeping with their functions, have performed all the transactions and provided the protection required of them by law.
.Lastly, the Government calls on the Committee on Freedom of Association to urge trade union organizations and complainants presenting cases before the Committee, to exhaust all internal remedies before the national authorities, in order to avoid Committee spending time on cases such as this that are being examined by the relevant authorities and which are subject to the corresponding proceedings.
.The Committee observes that in this case the allegations mainly refer to general non compliance with clauses in the collective agreements for the cement industry, either in relation to union officials or members, or to workers, who are accused of (having committed) offences or who are individually being deprived of agreed benefits; and to the fact that  collective agreements expired over four years ago.
.The Committee wishes to point out that allegations of non-compliance with collective agreements fall into the category of rights issues that must be dealt with by the parties and, in the event of dispute, by the administrative or judicial authorities, and that the Committee s remit is to determine whether the mechanisms are expeditious and have the trust of the parties.
.As regards the alleged violation of a number of clauses contained in the collective agreement signed by the enterprise Venezolana de Cementos S.A.C.A., the Committee notes that the Government declares that: in October ,  workers in SINTUECAV submitted a complaint before the labour inspectorate of the capital district, eastern sector, against the enterprise under conciliation proceedings; ten meetings with the labour inspectorate had been turned down prior to  October ; full conciliation was not achieved; and the conciliation proceedings were closed following the trade union s announcement that it would file a list of claims and would exercise its right to strike (according to the complainant ANTRACEM, on  June  the union came to an agreement with the enterprise for the payment of outstanding benefits and the enterprise announced the payment but continued to fail to meet its obligations). The Committee requests the Government to guarantee compliance with agreements that have been concluded and refers it to the last conclusion in this report.
.As regards the alleged non-compliance with clauses in the collective agreement reported by the Secretary-General of SINTRACEA in March , the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the complaint was submitted to the labour inspectorate of Puerto la Cruz and that once the proceedings were initiated, the case was referred to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on  July , and is currently pending a decision on its admissibility, before proceeding to the corresponding grievance hearing. As regards the enterprise s alleged non-compliance, reported in January  by the Secretary-General and the correspondence secretary of SINTRACEA, the Government also indicates that the case is still pending a decision on its admissibility before the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic, prior to holding the corresponding grievance hearing; the same is true of the claim submitted by SINTRACEA in Anzotegui on  March .
.The Committee regrets to find an excessive delay in the administration s processing of these cases, expects that they will be concluded in the near future and refers to its general conclusions at the end",1,2013,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
37,"of this report. The Committee emphasizes that justice delayed is justice denied [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para.].
.As regards the alleged cases of non-compliance with collective agreements reported by  workers (Juan Manosalva and others) against the same enterprise, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that they submitted their complaint for the restoration of the legal conditions breached in September , which led to a meeting with the labour inspectorate on  September , which explained the corrections that were required to ensure the admissibility and the continuation of the proceedings (such as indicating where they were transferred to).
.As regards the allegations in relation to the charges for misconduct brought against Mr Eduardo Adrin Zerpa and Mr Waldemar Pastor Crawther Snchez, the Committee takes due note that the Government indicates that the first complaint was withdrawn and that the labour inspectorate declared the second case inadmissible.
.The Committee observes that the Government has not sent specific information regarding some of the allegations and therefore requests it to send a detailed reply to the following allegations:?the allegation presented by SITRAMCT regarding its Secretary-General, Mr Jess Eliecer Martnez Surez, reporting that the Ministry of Science and Technology had not paid his evaluation-based wage increase and bonus, in violation of the collective agreement in force; non-compliance with clauses in collective agreements in the following cases: () as regards a number of clauses in the collective agreement between the enterprise C.A. Vencemos in Catia La Mar and SINTUECAV; and () the collective labour agreement of the ready-mix sector enterprise Cemex Venezuela, S.A.C.A., in the capital district, and SINTUECAV, for the period  May  to  May  (currently in force as no other collective agreement has been discussed) as regards union dues and allowances;?the suspension of part of the wages and benefits of the Secretary-General of SINTUECAV, Mr Ulice Rodrguez, which had been paid from  to , on a decision of the public management of Venezolana de Cementos S.A.C.A., which, in May , arbitrarily cut his wages by nearly  per cent, in violation of the collective agreement (according to the allegations, the executive committees of SINTUECAV, ANTRACEM and UNETE have submitted complaints to the enterprise through the labour inspectorate, the labour courts and other institutions, without securing the restoration of the union official s rights on the pretext that SINTUECAV s executive committee was allegedly in a situation of electoral default);?charges for misconduct were brought against the union official, Mr Jos Vale, the records and correspondence secretary, on  February  (on  January  an extraordinary assembly had been held to discuss the enterprise s violation of the collective labour agreement and its failure to provide a reply after the four meetings held between October  and January ; the assembly decided that it would remain in statutory assembly until the enterprise resolved the dispute);?the wages of Mr Manuel Rodrguez were also cut on  November , in violation of clause No.  of the collective labour agreement (basic wage or daily rate increases), and having declared itself incompetent to hear the claims the labour inspectorate invited the worker to file his claim before the courts;?in Lara State, on  April , the enterprise filed charges for misconduct before the labour inspectorate against the union official Mr Orlando Chirinos, organization secretary of SINTRACEL and leading member of ANTRACEM, in violation of the collective labour agreement. It also filed charges for misconduct against the workers Mr Waldemar Pastor Crawther Snchez and Mr Eduardo Adrin Zerpa, both members of SINTRACEL and ANTRACEM, violating the collective labour agreement and dated  May  and  February , respectively;?in Trujillo State, Mr Alexander Enrique Santos Mendoza was subjected to degradation of his employment conditions, persecution and harassment, and the ruling in his favour by the labour inspectorate of Valera in Trujillo State, was held in contempt by the management of Cemento Andino and Corporacin Socialista de Cemento.
.In general, the Committee observes that the picture that emerges from the allegations and from the Government s reply ' which only addresses some of those allegations ' is that administrative proceedings are very slow; they are at times blocked in institutions such as the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic; and many of them affect union officials. It observes, moreover, that no evidence is provided of sanctions for failure to comply with collective agreements. The Committee also observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that  collective agreements in the cement sector have expired and have not been renegotiated. The Committee requests the Government to take measures in consultation with the most representative trade unions and employers' organizations to promote collective bargaining in this sector and, in view of the excessive delays that it has found, to expedite disciplinary administrative proceedings in the event of repeated non compliance with collective agreements, and it requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures in consultation with the most representative trade unions and employers' organizations to promote collective bargaining in the cement sector (according to the allegations,  collective agreements have expired and have not been renegotiated) and, in view of the excessive delays that it has found, to expedite disciplinary administrative proceedings in the event of repeated non-compliance with collective agreements, and it requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send a detailed reply without delay on the allegations referred to in the conclusions.",1,2013,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
38,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Union of Press Workers (SNTP) dated  December .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  December .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  December , the SNTP alleges that two enterprises, Visin de Hoy Comunicaciones C.A. and C.A. Editorial Diario Vea, committed serious and repeated violations of Convention No.  by dismissing  of its workers on  October  because of their membership of the Unitary Trade Union of Graphic Arts and Similar and Connected Workers of the Federal District and Miranda State (SUTAGSC), and that the failure of the  Pedro Ortega Daz' labour inspectorate, which is attached to the People s Ministry for Labour and Social Security, to take action has rendered the application of the provisions of Convention No.  null and void.
.The complainant states that both enterprises operate from the same building; both develop, print and distribute publishing products; and the dismissed workers worked in both enterprises. The employees who were later dismissed had on  August  notified the Trade Union Department of the Labour Inspectorate of Libertador Municipality, Capital District, of the appointment of two SUTAGSC delegates. On  September , they submitted the forms authorizing the deduction of union dues, and on  October  they sent a communication to the president of Visin de Hoy Comunicaciones C.A. stating that they wished to continue their union membership. On  October , the workers sent a written communication to the Labour Inspectorate of Libertador Municipality, Capital District, in which they stated that the two enterprises would not recognize SUTAGSC union membership or the appointment of union delegates.
.On  October , both enterprises unjustly terminated the employment of  employees; on  November , the dismissed workers submitted an application to the  Pedro Ortega Daz' labour inspectorate for reinstatement and payment of lost wages. On  November , the Labour Inspectorate ordered the dismissed workers' reinstatement and payment of the lost wages as a  preventive measure'  with a view to reaching an agreement or acknowledgement of fault through conciliation. However, when visiting the premises of Visin de Hoy Comunicaciones C.A on  November  and C.A. Editorial Diario Vea on  November , the Special Commissioner of the Labour Inspectorate noted that the two enterprises had failed to comply with the preventive measure. The employers' non-compliance should have triggered administrative proceedings culminating in the issuance of an administrative ruling by the labour inspector; however, more than two years have passed and no ruling has been issued.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that the  Pedro Ortega Daz' labour inspectorate, which is attached to the People s Ministry for Labour and Social Security, complied fully with Convention No.  by issuing the corresponding administrative decisions ordering the reinstatement of the following citizens and payment of lost wages and other benefits which they had stopped receiving: Any del Carmen Charama Panacual, Jorge Gerardo Sanz, Robert Jose Migua Vargas, Wandit Rafael Charaya Panacual, Jorge Gerardo Marrero, Jess Francisco Rodrguez Bustamante, Csar Augusto Charama Pascual, Edgar Alberto Rastran Snchez, Rudy Marcano, Alexander Rafael Guete Hernndez, Jose Antonio Aguilera and Alberto Jos Rodrguez Ynez, and also Henry Landaeta Freddy Gmez, Jess Alberto Prez, Pablo Csar Gamboa Castellano, Jose Ricardo Moreno, Juan Carlos Gamboa, Gerardo Cerone Ruvo, Jose Vidal Vsquez, Carlos Roman Corro, Henry Gonzlez Quintero, Jean Carlos Vega, Adelso Vegas, Ernesto-Jos Rodrguez Rodrguez and Adolfo Antonio Castaeda Gonzlez.
.The Government adds that the administrative rulings which were executed by the aforementioned inspectorate were not observed by Visin de Hoy Comunicaciones C.A. and C.A. Editorial Diario Vea, whose legal representative stated that the workers would not be reinstated, since negotiations were under way before the Ombudsman concerning the payment of social benefits. In view of the aforementioned enterprises' refusal to reinstate the workers, the  Pedro Ortega Daz' labour inspectorate proceeded, in accordance with the provisions of articles  and  of the Organic Labour Act, to initiate the corresponding sanctions proceedings. The administrative channels are thereby exhausted; however, the workers who consider themselves affected may seek recourse through the labour courts.
.The Committee notes that this case concerns allegations of the anti-union dismissal of  workers by the enterprises Visin de Hoy Comunicaciones C.A. and C.A. Editorial Diario Vea as a result of the workers' membership of the complainant trade union; the appointment of two trade union delegates in October ; and the labour inspectorate s lack of action by having failed at the time of the complaint (almost two years after the fact) to issue the administrative decisions provided for under the law.
.The Committee notes that the Government states in its reply of  December  that the  Pedro Ortega Daz' labour inspectorate, which is attached to the People s Ministry for Labour and Social Security, issued, in strict compliance with Convention No. , the corresponding administrative decisions ordering that the  citizens to which the complainant refers be reinstated and paid for lost wages and other benefits which they had stopped receiving.
.The Committee further notes that the Government states that the two enterprises failed to comply with the administrative decisions and that their legal representative stated that the workers would not be reinstated, since negotiations were under way before the Ombudsman concerning the payment of social benefits. The Government adds that in view of the enterprises' refusal to reinstate the workers, the  Pedro Ortega Daz' labour inspectorate initiated the corresponding sanctions proceedings; and that workers who consider themselves affected may seek recourse through the labour courts.
.The Committee recalls that no person shall be prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ] and, since the labour inspectorate found the dismissals in this case to be unlawful, requests the Government to take the steps within its power to ensure compliance with the labour laws and in particular the reinstatement of the dismissed workers which was ordered by the inspectors. At the same time, the Committee requests the Government to advise whether the dismissed workers have taken legal action and to inform it of the outcome of the administrative sanctions proceedings.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the complainant trade union draws its attention to delays in the authorities' handling of its case. The Committee notes that the dismissals occurred in October  and that it appears in any event that the administrative sanctions proceedings have not yet been concluded. The Committee regrets this delay and requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the proceedings in question are concluded more expeditiously.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Since the labour inspectorate found the dismissals to be unlawful, the Committee requests it to take the steps within its power to ensure compliance with the labour laws and in particular the reinstatement of the  workers which was ordered by the labour inspectorate.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to advise whether the dismissed workers have taken legal action in the labour courts and to inform it of the outcome of the administrative sanctions proceedings.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to solicit information from the relevant national employers' organization, with a view to having at its disposal the views of the enterprises concerned.",0,2012,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
39,".The Committee examined this case at its June  and October November  meetings and, on the latter occasion, presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (November )].
.The Government sent additional observations in a communication dated  February .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, at its October November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the issues that remained pending [see rd Report, para. ]:(a) Underlining that the allegations refer to serious issues related to the freedom of trade unionists, the Committee firmly expects that the Government will send without delay the information that it has received from the Office of the Attorney-General on the situation concerning the five trade unionists in the construction sector mentioned in the allegations who were first detained and then brought before the military judicial authorities and required as an interim measure to report every week to the tribunal.(b) The Committee also invites the complainant organization to supply the names and union positions of the one hundred or so trade unionists who have reportedly faced criminal charges for having carried out union activities and, in the case that this is not possible, to indicate any eventual impediments to providing such information.
.With regard to recommendation (a), the complainant organization had stated that the alleged acts, involving the detention of, and bringing of charges against, trade unionists in the State of Tchira, occurred as from  August , noting that the trade unionists in question were Hictler Torres, Luis Arturo Gonzlez, Jos Martn Mora, Wilander Operaza and Ramiro Parada. According to the allegations, they were detained for having protested to demand the payment of their social benefits by the private enterprise Xocobeo CA, under contract with the Ministry of Housing and Environment for the construction of housing units in a military zone, Murach Fort. According to the allegations, the crimes with which they were charged were: failure to respect a sentry and failure to respect the armed forces, sections  and  of the Basic Code of Military Justice; and violation of the security zone, established by section  of the Basic Act on the Security of the Nation [see th Report, para. , and rd Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  February , the Government stated, with regard to recommendation (a) made by the Committee, that the Office of the Attorney-General has reported that there are no reports, nor do its records show, that any worker or executive of the private enterprise Xocobeo CA has been detained or that any of the individuals mentioned has been brought before  military judicial authorities'  The Government added that none of the  trade union organizations of construction workers that exist in the country have trade union officials or representatives registered by the names of Hictler Torres, Luis Arturo Gonzlez, Jos Martn Mora, Wilander Operaza and Ramiro Parada.
.In the light of the foregoing and, in particular, given that none of the workers mentioned by the complainant organization are being prosecuted or detained, the Government requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of the allegations.
.With regard to the complainant s allegations that more than one hundred workers have reportedly faced criminal charges for having exercised their trade union rights, the Government urges the Committee to decide, as it has done on other occasions, not to pursue the examination of this allegation in the absence of the specific information requested from the complainant.
.Lastly, the Government reiterates the comments that it presented during the previous examination of the case.
.With regard to recommendation (a) made during its previous examination of the case, the Committee takes due note of the statement by the Office of the Attorney-General, communicated by the Government, that the five workers mentioned by the complainant organizations are not being detained or prosecuted and have not been brought before a military tribunal. Under the circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.With regard to recommendation (b), the Committee notes with regret that the complainant organization has ignored the Committee s request that it supply the names of the one hundred or so trade unionists who have faced criminal charges for having carried out union activities. Consequently, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, paras ' ], approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ).
.The Government sent additional observations in a communication dated  May .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendation on the issues that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:' b) The Committee emphasizes the gravity of the allegations relating to the criminalization of trade union activities through military tribunals, and in particular the detention and referral to military tribunals, and the imposition of the requirement to report periodically every week to the military judicial authorities, of five trade unionists in the construction sector (for having demanded the payment of social benefits by a private enterprise Xocobeo CA, working under contract for the Ministry of Housing and Environment), in addition, according to the allegations, to the hundred or so workers who have faced criminal charges for exercising their trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to reply to these allegations without delay.
.The complainant organization had stated that the alleged acts, involving the detention of, and bringing of charges against, trade unionists in the State of Tchira, occurred as from  August , noting that the trade unionists in question were Hictler Torres, Luis Arturo Gonzlez, Jos Martn Mora, Wilander Operaza and Ramiro Parada. According to the allegations, they were detained for having protested to demand the payment of their social benefits by the private enterprise Xocobeo CA, under contract with the Ministry of Housing and Environment for the construction of housing units in a military zone, Murach Fort. According to the allegations, the crimes with which they were charged were: failure to respect a sentry and failure to respect the armed forces, sections  and  of the Basic Code of Military Justice; and violation of the security zone, established by section  of the Basic Act on the Security of the Nation [see th Report, para. ].
.With regard to the allegations concerning the so-called criminalization through military tribunals of the trade union activities of five trade unionists in the construction sector, the Government reports that there are three federations of trade unions for construction sector workers in the country: the National Federation of Professional Workers, Technical Workers and Labourers in the Construction, Timber, Heavy Machinery and Roads Industry and Allied Workers of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (FENACTS), which is affiliated to the Bolivarian Socialist Workers' Confederation of Venezuela (CBST); the Single National Federation of Bolivarian Construction Workers and Allied and Similar Workers (FUNTBCAC), previously affiliated to the National Union of Workers of Venezuela (UNETE) and currently to the CBST; and the Federation of Workers in the Construction and Timber Industries and Allied and Similar Workers of Venezuela (FETRACONSTRUCCION), affiliated to the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CTV).
.The Government notes that it is extremely odd that none of the three trade union federations mentioned above have approached any of the country s labour inspectorates or the Office of the Ombudsperson to report the detention by civilian or military authorities of union officials from the construction sector, as referred to in the communication.
.The Government adds that it is clear from the trade union registries that none of the  trade union organizations of construction workers that exist in the country have trade union officials or representatives registered by the names of Hictler Torres, Luis Arturo Gonzlez, Jos Martn Mora, Wilander Operaza and Ramiro Parada. The Government indicates that it finds it odd that a civil association of university teachers, whose activity is far removed from the world of housing construction, and not an organization of construction workers, should be presenting this complaint, which in principle means that it does not meet the receivability requirements. Nevertheless, the Government indicates that it has asked the Office of the Attorney-General to report on the alleged referral to military tribunals of any workers, whether trade union officials or not, from the enterprise Xocobeo CA, in . The Government states that it",0,2012,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
40,"will inform the Committee on Freedom of Association as soon as it receives a reply.
.With regard to the reference by the Committee to the complainant s allegations that more than one hundred workers have reportedly faced criminal charges for having exercised their trade union rights, the Government, with due respect, asks the members of the Committee to request the complainant to provide a list of the one hundred workers who have allegedly faced criminal charges with an indication of the trade union organization to which they belong and the trade union activity for which they are facing charges. Until this information is provided, the Government requests the Committee to refrain from announcing, as if there were some truth in the statement, that in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  more than a hundred workers are facing criminal charges for having exercised their trade union rights' 
.The Committee observes that the pending issue in this case relates to the detention of, and bringing of charges, in August , against five trade unionists in the construction sector for having protested to demand the payment of their social benefits by the private enterprise Xocobeo CA, under contract with the Ministry of Housing and Environment for the construction of housing units in a military zone (Murach Fort). According to the allegations, these trade unionists, charged with the crimes of failure to respect a sentry and failure to respect the armed forces (sections  and  of the Basic Code of Military Justice), and violation of the security zone (section  of the Basic Act on the Security of the Nation), were referred to military tribunals and required to report to the military judicial authorities every week, which, in the opinion of the complainant, amounts to the criminalization of trade union activities.
.According to the complainant organization, one hundred or so people have allegedly faced criminal charges for having exercised their trade union rights. The Committee notes that the Government contests the receivability of the complaint, pointing out that the complainant organization is a civil association of teachers, and not for the cement sector, and is not a registered trade union organization. The Committee wishes to note that, in its initial reply in the context of the previous examination of the case, in June , the Government did not present this objection with regard to receivability, and highlights that the allegations presented concern serious issues relating to the freedom of trade unionists.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: (i) it is odd that none of the three construction federations that exist have reported the alleged detentions to the labour inspectorate or to the Office of the Ombudsperson; (ii) the five trade unionists mentioned by the complainant organization are not registered as being union officials or representatives of any of the  trade union organizations that exist in the construction sector; and (iii) the complainant organization should be invited to provide the names and union positions of the one hundred or so workers who are allegedly facing criminal charges for having exercised their trade union rights.
.The Committee notes that, notwithstanding the above, the Government has requested information from the Office of the Attorney-General concerning the alleged detention of five trade unionists and will send this information to the Committee when it is received. The Committee emphasizes once again the seriousness of the allegations, which relate to the detention of five trade unionists who, according to the allegations, were brought before the military judicial authorities for having demanded the payment of their social benefits and were required, as an interim measure, to report every week to the judicial authorities. The Committee also highlights that these interim measures imposed by the military judicial authorities can only have an intimidating effect with regard to the exercise of trade union rights and that, depending on the location of the tribunal, may be extremely burdensome.
.The Committee is awaiting receipt of the information that the Government has requested from the Office of the Attorney-General and regrets that it is not yet able to benefit from this information, given that the allegations date back to August . The Committee, in order to be able to examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts, firmly expects that the Government will send, without delay, the information that it has received from the Office of the Attorney-General on the situation concerning these five trade unionists.
.Furthermore, taking into account the other statements made by the Government, the Committee invites the complainant organization to supply the names and union positions of the one hundred or so trade unionists who, according to the allegations, have faced criminal charges for having carried out union activities and, in the case that this is not possible, to indicate any eventual impediments to providing such information.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Underlining that the allegations refer to serious issues related to the freedom of trade unionists, the Committee firmly expects that the Government will send without delay the information that it has received from the Office of the Attorney-General on the situation concerning the five trade unionists in the construction sector mentioned in the allegations who were first detained and then brought before the military judicial authorities and required as an interim measure to report every week to the tribunal.(b) The Committee also invites the complainant organization to supply the names and union positions of the one hundred or so trade unionists who have reportedly faced criminal charges for having carried out union activities and, in the case that this is not possible, to indicate any eventual impediments to providing such information.
.The complaint relating to Case No.  was made by the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CTV) in a communication dated  January  and the complaint relating to Case No.  by the Association of Teachers of the Central University of Venezuela (APUCV); the latter organization transmitted additional information and further allegations in a communication dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October  and  February .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January , the CTV alleges that Decree No. , dated  December , was published in Official Gazette No.  of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, of  December , which created the  Presidential Commission for the Creation and Drafting of the new Basic Labour Act'  This Commission, in addition to being exclusive and closed, failed to include the CTV, the most representative trade union organization of Venezuelan workers. All of the members of the Commission (section  of the Decree) are representatives or persons tied to official circles in one way or another (ministers, the Attorney-General of the Republic, the President of a Bolivarian Socialist Central Organization of City, Rural and Maritime Workers, appointed personally and without election and who is part of a trade union bureaucracy designated by the President of the Republic, the President of a federation of employers (FEDEINDUSTRIA), magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice, certain labour experts, deputies in the National Assembly, and representatives of official circles). However, there was no representation of the real social partners who, in a democratic society, should be included, particularly when a new Basic Labour Act is to be discussed and drawn up to regulate labour relations in the country.
.The CTV, nevertheless, observes that articles () and () of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela provide for the prohibition of any type of discrimination on grounds of politics, age, race, sex, belief or any other condition. Furthermore, recognition of the principle of tripartite consultation set out in ILO Convention No.  requires the Venezuelan State, in accordance with Article (),  to operate procedures which ensure effective consultations ' between representatives of the government, of employers and of workers'  The CTV suffered discrimination by not being represented on the Presidential Commission for the drafting of the new Basic Labour Act. There was also discrimination against other pluralist and democratic trade union confederations in the country. All of this is in violation of Conventions Nos  and , particularly taking into account that under the terms of section () of the Decree, the Presidential Commission for the Creation and Drafting of the new Basic Labour Act shall include in its functions:  reviewing the current situation with regard to social benefits, rest periods, the working day, stability and the trial period, subcontracting, trade union membership and collective agreements, as well as any other area of labour regulation that it is necessary to adapt to the paradigms of a social State of law and justice, as well as proposing the establishment of new social institutions which dignify the condition of labour as an element of society' 
.Furthermore, in the third",0,2012,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
41,"and fourth preambular paragraphs of the Decree, reference is made to the construction of a socialist foundation and a workers' socialist government, which is in violation of article  of the Constitution respecting economic freedom and the role of the State. Finally, it was decided that the new Act would not be adopted through the ordinary legislative procedures, but through an enabling act of the Legislative Assembly in favour of the President of the Republic.
.In its communications dated  May  and  November , the APUCV alleges that the new Basic Act on Labour and Workers (LOTTT) is in violation of freedom of association. The Act was adopted by a Decree of the President of the Republic without any dialogue being held with the representative organizations of workers and employers, with the exception of the recently created and official  Socialist Central Organization of City, Rural and Maritime Workers'  In the end, a legal text was imposed in which the exclusive ideological position of the governing party is visible to the detriment of the plurality of ideas existing among Venezuelan workers.
.Moreover, in the Decree, the Government has ignored the recommendations made by the supervisory bodies of the ILO, which urged it to amend the legislation to bring it into line with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and , on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, in consultation with the representative organizations of workers and employers. The reports of the Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference record the repeated occasions on which the National Government has undertaken to comply with these recommendations. Nevertheless: () it failed to hold consultations and dialogue with the representative trade union organizations of Venezuelan workers, which are distinct from official organizations; () in open violation of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, it refused to allow the LOTTT to be discussed and approved by the National Assembly, which is the competent body for the adoption of laws; and () a brief review of the content of the chapter of the LOTTT on freedom of association shows that its rules are incompatible with Convention No.  on freedom of association.
.In this respect, the APUCV alleges that in the regulations set out in the LOTTT, the ideological aspects of certain rules give rise to serious uncertainties concerning trade union activity, since trade unions are assigned responsibilities which are those of the State. By way of example, section () and () respecting the attributions and objectives of trade unions, reads as follows:Section . Trade union organizations of workers shall have the following attributions and objectives:.	[ .	Contributing to the production and distribution of goods and services for the satisfaction of the needs of the people..	Exercising control and vigilance over costs and earnings, so that the prices of the goods and services produced are just for the people.
.In the view of the APUCV, such obligations are completely inconsistent with ILO Convention No. , which provides that trade union organizations shall be free to determine their programmes of action and the State shall refrain from any interference which limits this right. Furthermore, it is also the case that if a trade union does not fulfil the mandate set out in section , the Government will refuse to register it, as indicated in section () of the LOTTT:Section . The National Registrar of Trade Union Organizations may refuse to register a trade union in the following cases:.	If the trade union does not have as its objective the attributions and objectives envisaged in this Act.
.With regard to the right of organizations to draw up their rules and to elect their representatives in full freedom, the APUCV alleges that: () trade unions are required to set out in their by-laws the  replacement' of the members of their executive boards (sections  and  of the LOTTT) and  a system of balloting which includes the election of the executive board by a single vote and the proportional representation of minorities' (section (e)); () despite the reduction in the powers of the National Electoral Council (CNE) in trade union elections, there remain serious doubts concerning the purpose of the notification that has to be made by trade unions to the CNE when they decide to hold elections (section  of the LOTTT); () in clear contravention of the rights envisaged in Convention No. , trade union leaders are required to submit a  sworn declaration of property' to a state body, the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic. This requirement, which exists in the country only for persons who are public officials or who administer public property, undermines the private nature of trade union organizations and their assets: in other words, the basis is being established to qualify trade unions as legal persons in public law, subject to the control of the State; moreover the possibility for the controller to carry out audits of trade union accounts is also envisaged (sections ' ); and () section  of the transitional provision of the LOTTT requires trade union organizations to  adapt their by-laws' to the Act  before  December ' 
.In its communication of  November , the APUCV indicates that the Presidential Decree approved the provisions that are in violation of freedom of association which had been noted with concern for years by the supervisory bodies, and particularly the Committee on Freedom of Association, and set out new rules which may also be contrary to freedom of association, as described below.
.The Legislative Decree explicitly lays down, in contradiction with the recommendations of the ILO supervisory bodies:(a)	The  electoral abeyance' of trade unions, and particularly their leaders (sections , , , , () and ()). In accordance with these sections, the members of the executive board of a trade union have to be elected for a maximum period of three years (for unions and federations) or five years (confederations and central organizations). If this period elapses without new elections being held, the leaders automatically remain  in abeyance' and, as a result, can only carry out simple acts of administration and, accordingly, cannot represent the union in collective bargaining. This means that once abeyance has been declared, the leaders are incapacitated to act for the benefit of the union and the workers, and from joining within one year the provisional leadership of a new organization (section ()). The trade union is therefore left a rudderless ship. Moreover, from this moment, a vicious circle arises which makes it difficult to hold new trade union elections.(b)	Inadmissible and interventionist requirements for the registration of trade unions, which is indispensable for them to have legal personality (sections () and ).(c)	Interference in relation to the personal data of members of trade unions, as for each stage of the procedures that have to be undertaken by the trade union it is required to provide a list of its members, with a series of specifications. Moreover, the determination of trade union representative status is based in the first place on the list of members recorded in the National Register of Trade Unions (section ). It should be recalled that these lists have a very unsavoury history in the country, as they have been used in the past for trade union dismissals or can be used to deny employment in the public service or in state enterprises.(d)	As indicated in the previous communication of the APUCV concerning interference by the CNE and the Ministry of Labour in trade union elections, there would appear to be acceptance in the Legislative Decree of the viewpoints of the ILO supervisory bodies, as it is envisaged that the CNE should provide advice and logistical support to trade unions only if they so request (section ). Nevertheless, the CNE maintains its control over trade union elections in a much more subtle but real manner since, in accordance with sections ' , in all cases:?trade unions are required to notify the CNE when they hold elections, so that the CNE can publish the respective call for elections in the Electoral Gazette;?the Legislative Decree creates the requirement to establish a trade union electoral commission, but defines the terms of its action and converts the CNE into the arbitrator of trade union electoral decisions, as it hears appeals made against the decisions of this commission;?the CNE is responsible for  ensuring' observance of the proper procedures, and possibly intervening if so requested by  those concerned' ?the electoral commission has to provide the CNE with documentation of the procedure followed, with a view to the publication of the results. Even when the trade union does not request the  advice and support of the CNE'  the Legislative Decree complicates and renders bureaucratic trade union electoral procedures, especially for small trade unions, which make up the great majority, and particularly those in cities and locations distant from the institutions of the  electoral authority'  Moreover, all trade union electoral processes have to comply with a series",-1,2012,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
42,"of requirements and procedures in relation to the Ministry of Labour, which applies double standards in relation to trade unions, depending on whether they are independent or promoted by the Government;?moreover, the rules of the CNE remain in force to guarantee the human rights of workers in trade union elections (Resolution No. -, of  May ), which have been criticized by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Committee on Freedom of Association, and which have turned out to be an effective instrument for paralysing the electoral procedures of independent trade unions through appeals of all types, and particularly against the decision to call elections;?the vicious circle of interference is completed by obstacles to collective bargaining, particularly in the public sector, with the Government taking advantage of its own negligence (failure to calculate the cost of bargaining, the absence of instructions for negotiations, or the lack of approval by the Council of Ministers, sections , ,  and ) to oppose negotiation, in an approach that it has adopted systematically over the years. And, as if all this were not enough, the administration controls in a discretionary manner the competence of labour inspectors to  approve' collective agreements, without which they are not considered to be in force (sections ' ).
.The APUCV adds that the Legislative Decree refers to workers' councils, which are undefined, but in any case distinct from trade unions, and requires both workers' councils and trade unions to develop initiatives of support, coordination, supplementary action and solidarity in the social process of labour, intended to strengthen awareness and unity (sections ' ). The precise scope of these provisions is not clear although, considering the systematic anti-union attitude of the Government, they give rise to doubts concerning their implications for freedom of association.
.The APUCV alleges that the Legislative Decree has been added to a legal framework which severely restricts the exercise of freedom of association, including the exercise of public freedoms, and which is made up of rules which limit and allow the repression of the exercise of the freedom to demonstrate and call strikes, and the criminalization of trade union activities is now beginning to be carried out by military tribunals. For example, on  August , Hictler William Torres, Luis Arturo Gonzlez, Jos Martn Mora, Wilander Pedro Operaza and Ramiro Parada, trade unionists in the construction sector, were detained and referred to military tribunals, and were required to appear every week before the military penal judicial circuit of the th Supervisory Military Tribunal of the State of Tchira. They have to be added to the hundred or so workers who have faced criminal charges for exercising their trade union rights. In this case, the workers were detained for having protested to demand the payment of their social benefits by the private enterprise Xocobeo CA, under contract with the Ministry of Housing and Environment for the construction of housing units in a military zone, Murach Fort.  The crimes with which they were charged were: failure to respect a sentry and failure to respect the armed forces, sections  and  of the Basic Code of Military Justice, and violation of the security zone established by section  of the Basic Act on the Security of the Nation.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.With reference to the high-level mission that is to visit the country soon, the APUCV indicates that, with the new LOTTT, the Government is not only failing to take steps to resolve the problems that gave rise to the decision to send the mission, but has aggravated them.
.Finally, it indicates that, on the one hand, independent trade unions are being asphyxiated and, on the other, parallel trade unions are being promoted and workers are coming under pressure to migrate to these new trade unions, and that a new confederation has been created under the title of the  Socialist Central Organization of City, Rural and Maritime Workers'  under the patronage of the President of the Republic himself.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government sent its observations on the complaint by the CTV, alleging that the  Presidential Commission for the Creation and Drafting of the new Basic Labour Act' is exclusive, closed and in addition did not include the CTV, the trade union organization which, according to the CTV, is the most representative of Venezuelan workers.
.In this respect, the Government indicates that the citizen President, through Decree No. , published in Official Gazette No. , of  December , established a Commission for the Creation and Drafting of the new Basic Labour Act, with a view to adapting, balancing and redefining labour relations existing in the jurisdiction of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in accordance with a social State of law and justice, in which workers are in a situation of balance in relation to employers.
.On  May , the modern and revolutionary LOTTT was adopted; a commission composed of representatives of all sectors ' workers, rural workers, employers, the Government, the judicial and legislative authorities ' participated in its drafting, with a single objective: to put forward a bill reflecting the view of the people and which expressed collective interests and respected the inviolability and progressive nature of the rights of workers as set out in the Constitution.
.The Government indicates that ten years of meetings held in the National Assembly with various sectors were synthesized, and that during the last six months prior to the adoption of the Act, over , proposals were transmitted directly to the Commission, which were examined and publicly debated. A national and constructive debate gave rise to the Labour Act.
.The Government adds that the new Act demonstrates that only through social dialogue is it possible to build the laws and labour relations that are needed urgently by countries, with full respect for human rights. A direct dialogue with workers and their employers meant that an Act which was welcomed by all even before being adopted and which has been key to the sustained economic growth experienced by the country and an unemployment rate below  per cent, proved wrong those doubters who had warned of the closure of enterprises and unemployment, and demonstrated that the guarantee and protection of labour rights is a basic condition for the economic stability of a country.
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is an example of the consolidation of labour laws, the protection of freedom of association, collective bargaining and the right to strike. Protection is afforded to the family, extending the right to post-natal leave for women to six months and establishing the employment security of the father and the mother until the child has reached two years of age.
.The Government adds that the Act eradicates child labour, prohibits subcontracting, reduces working hours to  a week, guarantees the employment security of all workers, grants equal labour rights to domestic workers and consolidates a system of social security which includes self-employed workers and recognizes the work of women as housewives. In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the social protection system provides that the pension received shall be equal to the minimum wage. The requirement is placed on enterprises to allow traineeships and apprenticeships to stimulate youth employment. The Act recognizes fundamental rights and the historical struggle of the working class in the face of capitalism and savage globalization.
.There is a clear difference, not only with the repealed Act imposed by a closed and exclusive tripartism in , but also in relation to the economic models throughout the world which are today giving rise to structural crises with a substantial regression in the conquests of the working class.
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is the illustration that social dialogue has to be held directly with the social actors, avoiding the blackmail of underhand and group interests, that the collective interest has to be placed above the manipulations of groups, that the progressive nature of workers' rights has to be our objective, as work is a fundamental process in achieving a peace-loving society.
.As indicated by the Vice-Minister of Labour during the plenary of the st Session of the International Labour Conference,  there was a positive and constructive national debate, which gave rise to this revolutionary Labour Act written by the workers themselves and signed by our President, Hugo Chvez. Those who excluded themselves from this public debate remained on the sidelines: supporters of the old tripartite system who claim a representativeness they no longer enjoy and a voice to which they are no longer entitled  ?
.Taking into account the fundamental aspects and great progress of the new Basic Act on LOTTT, the Government indicates that the reasons for which this complaint was admitted have to be set aside, as the Act was discussed and adopted in the country, for which reason it calls on the Committee to close the present complaint as it now lacks any basis or validity.
.In reply to the complaint of the APUCV alleging violations of freedom of association in relation to the adoption of",1,2012,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
43,"the LOTTT, the Government reiterates in its communication of  February  the declarations made in its previous communication and emphasizes that all the points and considerations made by ILO bodies with regard to the previous legislation were considered in the new Basic Labour Act, which is in conformity with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  on freedom of association and collective bargaining. In view of the above, the Government rejects and is unable to understand the arguments of the APUCV, which are so blasphemous against the Act, and it rebuts each and every issue raised by the complainant as the new LOTTT guarantees and broadly protects freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.The Committee observes that in this complaint the complainant organizations object to the procedure followed by the authorities for the adoption of the new LOTTT, and more specifically the use of the mechanism of an enabling law by the Legislative Assembly to empower the President of the Republic to legislate, and the lack of consultation with the most representative trade union organizations, in violation of Convention No.  on tripartite consultations. One of the complainant organizations, which presented its complaint after the adoption of the LOTTT, also alleges that its content is in violation of Conventions Nos  and  and that it retains the legal provisions that are contrary to freedom of association as indicated by the ILO supervisory bodies, as well as provides for new provisions which are also contrary to those Conventions.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements according to which: () the citizen President, by means of Decree No. , published on  December , established a Commission for the Creation and Drafting of a new Basic Labour Act, composed of representatives of all sectors (workers, rural workers, employers, the Government, the judicial and legislative authorities); () ten years of meetings with the various sectors in the National Assembly were synthesized and, during the six months prior to the adoption of the Act (the LOTTT), over , proposals were transmitted to the Commission which were examined and discussed in a constructive national debate; () all the issues raised and considerations put forward by the ILO supervisory bodies in relation to the previous legislation were considered in the new Act which, in the view of the Government, is in accordance with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  on freedom of association and collective bargaining; the Government denies and rebuts each and every issue raised by the complainant organization APUCV and emphasizes that the new Act respects the inviolability and progressive nature of the rights of workers as set out in the Constitution; and () in contrast with what happened with the former Basic Labour Act, which was imposed by a closed and exclusive tripartism, in the process followed in relation to the LOTTT those who excluded themselves from the public debate remained on the sidelines, namely the proponents of an old tripartism who claim a representativeness that they no longer enjoy and a voice to which they are not entitled.
.The Committee notes that the Government refers to a series of achievements and progressive steps contained in the LOTTT in various areas, but recalls that its competence is confined to issues relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and it examines below the issues raised by the complainant organizations.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that, in its observations on the application of Conventions Nos  and , the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations made the following comments in relation to the new LOTTT:Convention No.  he Committee notes the Government s indications concerning the enactment of the Basic Act on labour and [men and women] workers (LOTTT) of  April . The Committee welcomes the fact that the new Act takes into account a number of the observations made during the technical assistance provided by the ILO and as requested by the Committee. For example, foreign nationals are no longer required to be resident for ten years to hold trade union office, the functions of the CNE are limited in relation to the previous situation, and the number of workers required to establish a union is reduced.However, the Committee notes that the minimum number of employers (ten) required to establish an employers' organization (section ) has not been reduced, the enumeration of the objectives of trade unions and employers' organizations continues to be too extensive (sections  and ), including for example the objectives according to which organizations need to guarantee the production and distribution of goods and services at the correct price in accordance with the law, undertaking studies on the characteristics of the respective industrial branch, providing reports as requested by the authorities in conformity with the law, conducting campaigns to combat corruption actively, etc.The Committee observes that the new Act provides, as indicated above, that the logistical support of the CNE for the organization of elections is only provided at the request of the trade union executive boards. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that the CNE (which is not a judicial body) continues to be competent to examine any complaints which may be made by members. Furthermore, in breach of the principle of trade union independence, the text of the Act also maintains the principle that delays in the electoral process (including when complaints are lodged with the CNE) prevent the trade unions concerned from engaging in collective bargaining. The Act also imposes a system of ballots which includes the election of the executive board by single vote and proportional representation (section ), while the Act continues to require trade unions to provide to the authorities the complete list of their members, and to supply the competent officials with the information that they request on their statutory obligations (section ). The Act also interferes in numerous matters that should be regulated by union statutes, for example, by indicating that the purpose of collective bargaining is to achieve the objectives of the State (section ), the eligibility of trade union leaders is subject to them having called trade union elections within the time limits when they were leaders of other organizations (section ), and a referendum is required to be held to revoke those holding trade union office (section ).The Committee further notes that, in the event of a strike, it is the competence of the People s Minister responsible for Labour (and not the judicial authorities or an independent body, particularly in the case of strikes in public enterprises or institutions) to determine the areas or activities which cannot be paralyzed during the strike on the grounds that they would affect the production of goods or essential services, the stoppage of which would harm the population (section ). The Committee notes the Government s statement that referring this to the judicial authorities would delay the right to strike. The Committee emphasizes that in the public sector the administrative authorities are an interested party in relation to the determination of minimum services. Furthermore, the system for the appointment of the members of arbitration boards in the event of strikes in essential services does not guarantee the confidence of the parties in the system since, where agreement is not reached by the parties, they are appointed by the labour inspector (section ). The Act also recognizes workers' councils, although their functions are not determined clearly, even though it is provided in the Act that they may not encroach upon the functions of trade unions. The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on this subject.Convention No. The Committee notes the adoption of new Basic Labour Act No.  of  May  concerning labour and [men and women] workers (LOTTT), which contains provisions providing full protection for workers against acts of anti-union discrimination and interference, with sufficiently dissuasive sanctions.Article  of the Convention. Pree and voluntary negotiation. The Committee observes that section  of the LOTTT provides that  discussion of proposals for collective bargaining shall take place in the presence of a labour official, who shall chair the meetings'  The Committee considers that this amounts to interference in the negotiations between the parties and is therefore contrary to the principles of free and voluntary negotiation and the autonomy of the parties. The Committee emphasizes the importance of amending this provision to bring it into full conformity with the abovementioned principles and requests the Government to indicate the measures taken or contemplated in this respect.Moreover, the Committee notes that section  concerning the registration of collective agreements states that  the labour inspector shall verify its conformity with the applicable public order regulations, with a view to granting approval'  Section  concerning the granting of approval states that  if the labour inspector considers it appropriate, he or she shall make the appropriate observations or recommendations to the parties instead of granting approval, and such observations and recommendations must be complied with within the next  working days'  The Committee recalls that,",-1,2012,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
44,"in general terms, making the entry into force of collective agreements concluded by the parties dependent on their approval by the authorities is contrary to the principles of collective bargaining established by Convention No. . The Committee considers that provisions of this sort are compatible with the Convention on condition that refusal of approval is restricted to cases in which the collective agreement contains flaws regarding its form or does not comply with the minimum standards laid down by the general labour legislation. The Committee requests the Government to provide further information on the scope of sections  and .Furthermore, the Committee notes that section  concerning mediation and arbitration states, with regard to bargaining by branch of activity, that  if conciliation is not possible, the labour official, at the request of the parties or on his or her own initiative, shall submit the dispute to arbitration unless the participating trade union organizations state their intention to exercise the right to strike'  The Committee further notes that section  states that  should a dispute be submitted to arbitration, an arbitration board composed of three members shall be established. One member shall be chosen by the employers from a list submitted by the workers; another shall be chosen by the workers from a list submitted by the employers; and the third member shall be chosen by mutual agreement. If no agreement is reached on nominations at the end of five successive days, the labour inspector shall designate the representatives'  The Committee recalls that arbitration ordered by the authorities should be restricted to essential services in the strict sense of the term and cases involving public servants exercising authority in the name of the State and considers that the designation of members by the labour inspector does not ensure that the parties will have confidence in the board that is established. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the measures contemplated to abolish arbitration ordered on the initiative of the authorities (except in the abovementioned cases) and to ensure that the composition of the arbitration board enjoys the confidence of the parties.
.The Committee considers it indispensable that the Government submit the legal provisions criticized above to tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of workers and employers with a view to bringing those provisions of the LOTTT into full conformity with Conventions Nos  and . The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures in this respect.
.The Committee wishes to emphasize that over the years when examining various complaints relating to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela it has noted the use in many cases of enabling legislation by the Legislative Assembly empowering the President of the Republic to adopt many decrees and laws which affect the interests of workers' and employers' organizations without a parliamentary debate being held. In the present case, through the enabling Act, the President of the Republic established a special Commission to draft the new LOTTT, however, alongside the various representatives of the state authorities it only included one representative of a workers' central organization (the representativeness and independence of which is questioned by the complainant organization APUCV) and a representative of an employers' federation (when there exists a more representative federation (FEDECAMARAS) in the country), with the result that the most representative organizations did not participate in the Commission. The Committee deeply deplores the situation so described and expects that, in future, in-depth consultations will be held with the most representative organizations of workers and employers on draft legislation covering labour or social matters which affect their interests and those of their members, prior to the drafting of the legislation, and that it is the Legislative Assembly, in the context of parliamentary debate, which adopts labour and social legislation.
.Under these conditions, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the principle that tripartite consultation should take place before the Government submits a draft to the Legislative Assembly or establishes a labour, social or economic policy, and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation on labour matters should be preceded by consultations with organizations of workers and employers [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee recalls that such consultations should be full, frank and detailed [see Digest, op. cit., paras ' ], and that the process of consultation on labour and minimum wages helps to give laws, programmes and measures adopted or applied by public authorities a firmer justification and helps to ensure that they are well respected and successfully applied. The Government should seek general consensus as much as possible, given that employers' and workers' organizations should be able to share in the responsibility of securing the well-being and prosperity of the community as a whole. This is particularly important given the growing complexity of the problems faced by societies. No public authority can claim to have all the answers, nor assume that all its proposals will naturally achieve all of their objectives [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to respect these principles in full in the future.
.Furthermore, although the Committee notes that the Government rejects all the allegations made by the complainant organization APUCV, it wishes to emphasize the gravity of the allegations relating to the criminalization of trade union activities through military tribunals, and in particular the detention and referral to military courts, including the requirement to report every week to the judicial military authorities, of five trade unionists in the construction sector (for having called for the payment of social benefits by a private enterprise Xocobeo CA, working under contract for the Ministry of Housing and the Environment), in addition, according to the allegations, to the hundred or so workers facing criminal charges for exercising their trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to reply to these allegations without delay.
.In light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Regretting that the Commission entrusted with drafting the new LOTTT excluded the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, the Committee requests the Government to submit to tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of workers and employers the provisions of the LOTTT respecting freedom of association and collective bargaining criticized by the Committee of Experts with a view to bringing those provisions into full conformity with ILO Conventions Nos  and  and to keep it informed of developments in this respect. The Committee requests the Government to comply in future with the principles relating to consultation and social dialogue set out in its conclusions.(b)	The Committee emphasizes the gravity of the allegations relating to the criminalization of trade union activities through military tribunals, and in particular the detention and referral to military tribunals, and the imposition of the requirement to report periodically every week to the military judicial authorities, of five trade unionists in the construction sector (for having demanded the payment of social benefits by a private enterprise Xocobeo CA, working under contract for the Ministry of Housing and Environment), in addition, according to the allegations, to the hundred or so workers who have faced criminal charges for exercising their trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to reply to these allegations without delay.",-1,2012,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
45,".At its November  meeting, the Committee, underlining the importance of the principles relating to consultation and social dialogue, reiterated its earlier recommendation [see rd Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (October November )]:' Regretting that the Commission entrusted with drafting the new Basic Act on Labour and Workers (LOTTT) excluded the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, the Committee requests the Government to submit to tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of workers and employers the provisions of the LOTTT respecting freedom of association and collective bargaining criticized by the Committee of Experts with a view to bringing those provisions into full conformity with ILO Conventions Nos  and  and to keep it informed of developments in this respect. The Committee requests the Government to comply in future with the principles relating to consultation and social dialogue set out in its conclusions.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government indicates that the assertion that it had excluded the most representative workers' and employers' organizations from the commission entrusted with drafting the Basic Act on Labour and Workers (LOTTT) is false. The Government reiterates that the worker members on that commission were nominated by the Bolivarian Socialist Workers' Confederation (CBST), as the largest and most representative workers' organization. Moreover, with regard to the employers, the Government reports that the president of FEDEINDUSTRIA had participated in the commission, and that FEDECAMARAS had declined to participate in commissions established by the then President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Finally, the Government affirms that all the provisions of the LOTTT, including those referring to freedom of association and collective bargaining, are the subject of constant review through continuous dialogue with all trade union organizations. In addition, the Government emphasizes that the provisions of the LOTTT introduced very few substantive changes in respect of previous laws' content, including the Labour Law of , which was drafted with technical assistance from the ILO.
.The Committee takes note of the information from the Government. While noting that the Government affirms that the provisions of the LOTTT relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining are the subject of constant review through continuous dialogue with all trade union organizations, the Committee observes that the Government provides no details about the dialogue and the constant review to which it refers, nor does it clarify who participated nor the results. The Committee also regrets that the Government does not indicate that it has taken any actions to follow up on its previous recommendation through tripartite dialogue. The Committee urges the Government to set up without delay a mechanism to engage in a tripartite dialogue with all of the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, the provisions of the LOTTT in relation to freedom of association and collective bargaining in the light of comments made by the ILO s supervisory bodies. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard ' detailing the dialogue mechanisms, the participating organizations and the results.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Governments and/or complainants concerned to keep it informed of any developments relating to the following cases.CaseLast examination on the meritsLast follow-up examination (Colombia)March November  (Republic of Korea)March June  (Paraguay)June March  (Pakistan)March November  (Colombia)March November  (Colombia)March November  (Philippines)June November  (Argentina)November November  (Malaysia)March November  (Philippines)March November  (Ecuador)June June  (Guatemala)March March  (Colombia)November June  (Democratic Republic of the Congo)November June  (Fiji)June March  (Argentina)March November  (France)November March  (Ecuador)June March  (Democratic Republic of the Congo)March '  (Malaysia)March June  (Peru)March November  (El Salvador)June June  (Bahrain)October November  (Pakistan)March '  (Nicaragua)June November  (Democratic Republic of the Congo)March March  (Colombia)March '  (Jordan)March November  (Qatar)March June  (Tunisia)June '  (Canada)March '  (Turkey)June November  (Paraguay)March '  (Colombia)November '  (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela)November '  (Denmark)November June  (Guatemala)November November  (Cameroon)November '  (Argentina)November '  (Republic of Korea)March '  (El Salvador)June '  (Panama)November '  (Argentina)November '  (Tunisia)November '  (India)March '  (Colombia)November '  (Panama)November '  (Canada)March '  (Paraguay)June '  (Cambodia)November '  (Paraguay)June '  (Malaysia)November '  (Colombia)June '  (Paraguay)June '  (Philippines)June '  (Costa Rica)June '  (Thailand)November '  (El Salvador)November '  (Guinea)June '  (Romania)November '  (Republic of Korea)November '

.At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )]:' Regretting that the Commission entrusted with drafting the new Basic Act on Labour and Workers (LOTTT) excluded the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, the Committee requests the Government to submit to tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of workers and employers the provisions of the LOTTT respecting freedom of association and collective bargaining criticized by the Committee of Experts with a view to bringing those provisions into full conformity with ILO Conventions Nos  and  and to keep it informed of developments in this respect. The Committee requests the Government to comply in future with the principles relating to consultation and social dialogue set out in its conclusions.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that the complainant organization, the Confederation of Workers of Venezuelan (CTV), does not have the status of a majority trade union confederation and consequently did not participate in the Presidential Commission for the Elaboration and Drafting of the LOTTT (unlike ' it says ' the Bolivarian Socialist Workers' Confederation of Venezuela (CBST)). The Government adds that in the framework of the consultations conducted at the National Assembly with all the sectors over a period of  years, the CTV participated on a number of occasions; the Presidential Commission noted all the proposals submitted to the General Assembly and conducted broad consultations with the trade union organizations (in particular through the Tripartite Commission of ); the observations of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) and the Committee on Freedom of Association were taken into account. For these reasons, the Government questions the criticisms of the CEACR regarding specific provisions and the request that the points in question be submitted to tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of workers and employers.
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government. The Committee stresses the importance of the LOTTT provisions relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining being accepted to the maximum extent possible by the most representative organizations of employers and workers and being in full conformity with ILO Conventions Nos  and . The Committee therefore reiterates its earlier recommendation in which it emphasized the importance of the principles governing consultation and social dialogue and requested social dialogue on the LOTTT provisions criticized by the Committee of Experts in its examination of the application of Conventions Nos  and  [see th Report, para. ].
.The complaint relating to Case No.  was made by the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CTV) in a communication dated  January  and the complaint relating to Case No.  by the Association of Teachers of the Central University of Venezuela (APUCV); the latter organization transmitted additional information and further allegations in a communication dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October  and  February .
.The Bolivarian Republic",-1,2011,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
46,"of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January , the CTV alleges that Decree No. , dated  December , was published in Official Gazette No.  of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, of  December , which created the  Presidential Commission for the Creation and Drafting of the new Basic Labour Act'  This Commission, in addition to being exclusive and closed, failed to include the CTV, the most representative trade union organization of Venezuelan workers. All of the members of the Commission (section  of the Decree) are representatives or persons tied to official circles in one way or another (ministers, the Attorney-General of the Republic, the President of a Bolivarian Socialist Central Organization of City, Rural and Maritime Workers, appointed personally and without election and who is part of a trade union bureaucracy designated by the President of the Republic, the President of a federation of employers (FEDEINDUSTRIA), magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice, certain labour experts, deputies in the National Assembly, and representatives of official circles). However, there was no representation of the real social partners who, in a democratic society, should be included, particularly when a new Basic Labour Act is to be discussed and drawn up to regulate labour relations in the country.
.The CTV, nevertheless, observes that articles () and () of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela provide for the prohibition of any type of discrimination on grounds of politics, age, race, sex, belief or any other condition. Furthermore, recognition of the principle of tripartite consultation set out in ILO Convention No.  requires the Venezuelan State, in accordance with Article (),  to operate procedures which ensure effective consultations ' between representatives of the government, of employers and of workers'  The CTV suffered discrimination by not being represented on the Presidential Commission for the drafting of the new Basic Labour Act. There was also discrimination against other pluralist and democratic trade union confederations in the country. All of this is in violation of Conventions Nos  and , particularly taking into account that under the terms of section () of the Decree, the Presidential Commission for the Creation and Drafting of the new Basic Labour Act shall include in its functions:  reviewing the current situation with regard to social benefits, rest periods, the working day, stability and the trial period, subcontracting, trade union membership and collective agreements, as well as any other area of labour regulation that it is necessary to adapt to the paradigms of a social State of law and justice, as well as proposing the establishment of new social institutions which dignify the condition of labour as an element of society' 
.Furthermore, in the third and fourth preambular paragraphs of the Decree, reference is made to the construction of a socialist foundation and a workers' socialist government, which is in violation of article  of the Constitution respecting economic freedom and the role of the State. Finally, it was decided that the new Act would not be adopted through the ordinary legislative procedures, but through an enabling act of the Legislative Assembly in favour of the President of the Republic.
.In its communications dated  May  and  November , the APUCV alleges that the new Basic Act on Labour and Workers (LOTTT) is in violation of freedom of association. The Act was adopted by a Decree of the President of the Republic without any dialogue being held with the representative organizations of workers and employers, with the exception of the recently created and official  Socialist Central Organization of City, Rural and Maritime Workers'  In the end, a legal text was imposed in which the exclusive ideological position of the governing party is visible to the detriment of the plurality of ideas existing among Venezuelan workers.
.Moreover, in the Decree, the Government has ignored the recommendations made by the supervisory bodies of the ILO, which urged it to amend the legislation to bring it into line with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and , on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, in consultation with the representative organizations of workers and employers. The reports of the Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference record the repeated occasions on which the National Government has undertaken to comply with these recommendations. Nevertheless: () it failed to hold consultations and dialogue with the representative trade union organizations of Venezuelan workers, which are distinct from official organizations; () in open violation of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, it refused to allow the LOTTT to be discussed and approved by the National Assembly, which is the competent body for the adoption of laws; and () a brief review of the content of the chapter of the LOTTT on freedom of association shows that its rules are incompatible with Convention No.  on freedom of association.
.In this respect, the APUCV alleges that in the regulations set out in the LOTTT, the ideological aspects of certain rules give rise to serious uncertainties concerning trade union activity, since trade unions are assigned responsibilities which are those of the State. By way of example, section () and () respecting the attributions and objectives of trade unions, reads as follows:Section . Trade union organizations of workers shall have the following attributions and objectives:.	[ .	Contributing to the production and distribution of goods and services for the satisfaction of the needs of the people..	Exercising control and vigilance over costs and earnings, so that the prices of the goods and services produced are just for the people.
.In the view of the APUCV, such obligations are completely inconsistent with ILO Convention No. , which provides that trade union organizations shall be free to determine their programmes of action and the State shall refrain from any interference which limits this right. Furthermore, it is also the case that if a trade union does not fulfil the mandate set out in section , the Government will refuse to register it, as indicated in section () of the LOTTT:Section . The National Registrar of Trade Union Organizations may refuse to register a trade union in the following cases:.	If the trade union does not have as its objective the attributions and objectives envisaged in this Act.
.With regard to the right of organizations to draw up their rules and to elect their representatives in full freedom, the APUCV alleges that: () trade unions are required to set out in their by-laws the  replacement' of the members of their executive boards (sections  and  of the LOTTT) and  a system of balloting which includes the election of the executive board by a single vote and the proportional representation of minorities' (section (e)); () despite the reduction in the powers of the National Electoral Council (CNE) in trade union elections, there remain serious doubts concerning the purpose of the notification that has to be made by trade unions to the CNE when they decide to hold elections (section  of the LOTTT); () in clear contravention of the rights envisaged in Convention No. , trade union leaders are required to submit a  sworn declaration of property' to a state body, the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic. This requirement, which exists in the country only for persons who are public officials or who administer public property, undermines the private nature of trade union organizations and their assets: in other words, the basis is being established to qualify trade unions as legal persons in public law, subject to the control of the State; moreover the possibility for the controller to carry out audits of trade union accounts is also envisaged (sections ' ); and () section  of the transitional provision of the LOTTT requires trade union organizations to  adapt their by-laws' to the Act  before  December ' 
.In its communication of  November , the APUCV indicates that the Presidential Decree approved the provisions that are in violation of freedom of association which had been noted with concern for years by the supervisory bodies, and particularly the Committee on Freedom of Association, and set out new rules which may also be contrary to freedom of association, as described below.
.The Legislative Decree explicitly lays down, in contradiction with the recommendations of the ILO supervisory bodies:(a)	The  electoral abeyance' of trade unions, and particularly their leaders (sections , , , , () and ()). In accordance with these sections, the members of the executive board of a trade union have to be elected for a maximum period of three years (for unions and federations) or five years (confederations and central organizations). If this period elapses without new elections being held, the leaders automatically remain  in abeyance' and, as a result, can only carry out simple acts of administration",-1,2011,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
47,"and, accordingly, cannot represent the union in collective bargaining. This means that once abeyance has been declared, the leaders are incapacitated to act for the benefit of the union and the workers, and from joining within one year the provisional leadership of a new organization (section ()). The trade union is therefore left a rudderless ship. Moreover, from this moment, a vicious circle arises which makes it difficult to hold new trade union elections.(b)	Inadmissible and interventionist requirements for the registration of trade unions, which is indispensable for them to have legal personality (sections () and ).(c)	Interference in relation to the personal data of members of trade unions, as for each stage of the procedures that have to be undertaken by the trade union it is required to provide a list of its members, with a series of specifications. Moreover, the determination of trade union representative status is based in the first place on the list of members recorded in the National Register of Trade Unions (section ). It should be recalled that these lists have a very unsavoury history in the country, as they have been used in the past for trade union dismissals or can be used to deny employment in the public service or in state enterprises.(d)	As indicated in the previous communication of the APUCV concerning interference by the CNE and the Ministry of Labour in trade union elections, there would appear to be acceptance in the Legislative Decree of the viewpoints of the ILO supervisory bodies, as it is envisaged that the CNE should provide advice and logistical support to trade unions only if they so request (section ). Nevertheless, the CNE maintains its control over trade union elections in a much more subtle but real manner since, in accordance with sections ' , in all cases:?trade unions are required to notify the CNE when they hold elections, so that the CNE can publish the respective call for elections in the Electoral Gazette;?the Legislative Decree creates the requirement to establish a trade union electoral commission, but defines the terms of its action and converts the CNE into the arbitrator of trade union electoral decisions, as it hears appeals made against the decisions of this commission;?the CNE is responsible for  ensuring' observance of the proper procedures, and possibly intervening if so requested by  those concerned' ?the electoral commission has to provide the CNE with documentation of the procedure followed, with a view to the publication of the results. Even when the trade union does not request the  advice and support of the CNE'  the Legislative Decree complicates and renders bureaucratic trade union electoral procedures, especially for small trade unions, which make up the great majority, and particularly those in cities and locations distant from the institutions of the  electoral authority'  Moreover, all trade union electoral processes have to comply with a series of requirements and procedures in relation to the Ministry of Labour, which applies double standards in relation to trade unions, depending on whether they are independent or promoted by the Government;?moreover, the rules of the CNE remain in force to guarantee the human rights of workers in trade union elections (Resolution No. -, of  May ), which have been criticized by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Committee on Freedom of Association, and which have turned out to be an effective instrument for paralysing the electoral procedures of independent trade unions through appeals of all types, and particularly against the decision to call elections;?the vicious circle of interference is completed by obstacles to collective bargaining, particularly in the public sector, with the Government taking advantage of its own negligence (failure to calculate the cost of bargaining, the absence of instructions for negotiations, or the lack of approval by the Council of Ministers, sections , ,  and ) to oppose negotiation, in an approach that it has adopted systematically over the years. And, as if all this were not enough, the administration controls in a discretionary manner the competence of labour inspectors to  approve' collective agreements, without which they are not considered to be in force (sections ' ).
.The APUCV adds that the Legislative Decree refers to workers' councils, which are undefined, but in any case distinct from trade unions, and requires both workers' councils and trade unions to develop initiatives of support, coordination, supplementary action and solidarity in the social process of labour, intended to strengthen awareness and unity (sections ' ). The precise scope of these provisions is not clear although, considering the systematic anti-union attitude of the Government, they give rise to doubts concerning their implications for freedom of association.
.The APUCV alleges that the Legislative Decree has been added to a legal framework which severely restricts the exercise of freedom of association, including the exercise of public freedoms, and which is made up of rules which limit and allow the repression of the exercise of the freedom to demonstrate and call strikes, and the criminalization of trade union activities is now beginning to be carried out by military tribunals. For example, on  August , Hictler William Torres, Luis Arturo Gonzlez, Jos Martn Mora, Wilander Pedro Operaza and Ramiro Parada, trade unionists in the construction sector, were detained and referred to military tribunals, and were required to appear every week before the military penal judicial circuit of the th Supervisory Military Tribunal of the State of Tchira. They have to be added to the hundred or so workers who have faced criminal charges for exercising their trade union rights. In this case, the workers were detained for having protested to demand the payment of their social benefits by the private enterprise Xocobeo CA, under contract with the Ministry of Housing and Environment for the construction of housing units in a military zone, Murach Fort.  The crimes with which they were charged were: failure to respect a sentry and failure to respect the armed forces, sections  and  of the Basic Code of Military Justice, and violation of the security zone established by section  of the Basic Act on the Security of the Nation.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.With reference to the high-level mission that is to visit the country soon, the APUCV indicates that, with the new LOTTT, the Government is not only failing to take steps to resolve the problems that gave rise to the decision to send the mission, but has aggravated them.
.Finally, it indicates that, on the one hand, independent trade unions are being asphyxiated and, on the other, parallel trade unions are being promoted and workers are coming under pressure to migrate to these new trade unions, and that a new confederation has been created under the title of the  Socialist Central Organization of City, Rural and Maritime Workers'  under the patronage of the President of the Republic himself.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government sent its observations on the complaint by the CTV, alleging that the  Presidential Commission for the Creation and Drafting of the new Basic Labour Act' is exclusive, closed and in addition did not include the CTV, the trade union organization which, according to the CTV, is the most representative of Venezuelan workers.
.In this respect, the Government indicates that the citizen President, through Decree No. , published in Official Gazette No. , of  December , established a Commission for the Creation and Drafting of the new Basic Labour Act, with a view to adapting, balancing and redefining labour relations existing in the jurisdiction of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in accordance with a social State of law and justice, in which workers are in a situation of balance in relation to employers.
.On  May , the modern and revolutionary LOTTT was adopted; a commission composed of representatives of all sectors ' workers, rural workers, employers, the Government, the judicial and legislative authorities ' participated in its drafting, with a single objective: to put forward a bill reflecting the view of the people and which expressed collective interests and respected the inviolability and progressive nature of the rights of workers as set out in the Constitution.
.The Government indicates that ten years of meetings held in the National Assembly with various sectors were synthesized, and that during the last six months prior to the adoption of the Act, over , proposals were transmitted directly to the Commission, which were examined and publicly debated. A national and constructive debate gave rise to the Labour Act.
.The Government adds that the new Act demonstrates that only through social dialogue is it possible to build the laws and labour relations that are needed urgently by countries, with full respect for human rights. A direct dialogue with workers and their employers meant that an Act which was welcomed by all even before being adopted and which has been key to the sustained economic growth experienced by the country and an unemployment rate below  per cent, proved wrong those doubters who",1,2011,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
48,"had warned of the closure of enterprises and unemployment, and demonstrated that the guarantee and protection of labour rights is a basic condition for the economic stability of a country.
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is an example of the consolidation of labour laws, the protection of freedom of association, collective bargaining and the right to strike. Protection is afforded to the family, extending the right to post-natal leave for women to six months and establishing the employment security of the father and the mother until the child has reached two years of age.
.The Government adds that the Act eradicates child labour, prohibits subcontracting, reduces working hours to  a week, guarantees the employment security of all workers, grants equal labour rights to domestic workers and consolidates a system of social security which includes self-employed workers and recognizes the work of women as housewives. In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the social protection system provides that the pension received shall be equal to the minimum wage. The requirement is placed on enterprises to allow traineeships and apprenticeships to stimulate youth employment. The Act recognizes fundamental rights and the historical struggle of the working class in the face of capitalism and savage globalization.
.There is a clear difference, not only with the repealed Act imposed by a closed and exclusive tripartism in , but also in relation to the economic models throughout the world which are today giving rise to structural crises with a substantial regression in the conquests of the working class.
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is the illustration that social dialogue has to be held directly with the social actors, avoiding the blackmail of underhand and group interests, that the collective interest has to be placed above the manipulations of groups, that the progressive nature of workers' rights has to be our objective, as work is a fundamental process in achieving a peace-loving society.
.As indicated by the Vice-Minister of Labour during the plenary of the st Session of the International Labour Conference,  there was a positive and constructive national debate, which gave rise to this revolutionary Labour Act written by the workers themselves and signed by our President, Hugo Chvez. Those who excluded themselves from this public debate remained on the sidelines: supporters of the old tripartite system who claim a representativeness they no longer enjoy and a voice to which they are no longer entitled  ?
.Taking into account the fundamental aspects and great progress of the new Basic Act on LOTTT, the Government indicates that the reasons for which this complaint was admitted have to be set aside, as the Act was discussed and adopted in the country, for which reason it calls on the Committee to close the present complaint as it now lacks any basis or validity.
.In reply to the complaint of the APUCV alleging violations of freedom of association in relation to the adoption of the LOTTT, the Government reiterates in its communication of  February  the declarations made in its previous communication and emphasizes that all the points and considerations made by ILO bodies with regard to the previous legislation were considered in the new Basic Labour Act, which is in conformity with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  on freedom of association and collective bargaining. In view of the above, the Government rejects and is unable to understand the arguments of the APUCV, which are so blasphemous against the Act, and it rebuts each and every issue raised by the complainant as the new LOTTT guarantees and broadly protects freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.The Committee observes that in this complaint the complainant organizations object to the procedure followed by the authorities for the adoption of the new LOTTT, and more specifically the use of the mechanism of an enabling law by the Legislative Assembly to empower the President of the Republic to legislate, and the lack of consultation with the most representative trade union organizations, in violation of Convention No.  on tripartite consultations. One of the complainant organizations, which presented its complaint after the adoption of the LOTTT, also alleges that its content is in violation of Conventions Nos  and  and that it retains the legal provisions that are contrary to freedom of association as indicated by the ILO supervisory bodies, as well as provides for new provisions which are also contrary to those Conventions.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements according to which: () the citizen President, by means of Decree No. , published on  December , established a Commission for the Creation and Drafting of a new Basic Labour Act, composed of representatives of all sectors (workers, rural workers, employers, the Government, the judicial and legislative authorities); () ten years of meetings with the various sectors in the National Assembly were synthesized and, during the six months prior to the adoption of the Act (the LOTTT), over , proposals were transmitted to the Commission which were examined and discussed in a constructive national debate; () all the issues raised and considerations put forward by the ILO supervisory bodies in relation to the previous legislation were considered in the new Act which, in the view of the Government, is in accordance with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  on freedom of association and collective bargaining; the Government denies and rebuts each and every issue raised by the complainant organization APUCV and emphasizes that the new Act respects the inviolability and progressive nature of the rights of workers as set out in the Constitution; and () in contrast with what happened with the former Basic Labour Act, which was imposed by a closed and exclusive tripartism, in the process followed in relation to the LOTTT those who excluded themselves from the public debate remained on the sidelines, namely the proponents of an old tripartism who claim a representativeness that they no longer enjoy and a voice to which they are not entitled.
.The Committee notes that the Government refers to a series of achievements and progressive steps contained in the LOTTT in various areas, but recalls that its competence is confined to issues relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and it examines below the issues raised by the complainant organizations.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that, in its observations on the application of Conventions Nos  and , the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations made the following comments in relation to the new LOTTT:Convention No.  he Committee notes the Government s indications concerning the enactment of the Basic Act on labour and [men and women] workers (LOTTT) of  April . The Committee welcomes the fact that the new Act takes into account a number of the observations made during the technical assistance provided by the ILO and as requested by the Committee. For example, foreign nationals are no longer required to be resident for ten years to hold trade union office, the functions of the CNE are limited in relation to the previous situation, and the number of workers required to establish a union is reduced.However, the Committee notes that the minimum number of employers (ten) required to establish an employers' organization (section ) has not been reduced, the enumeration of the objectives of trade unions and employers' organizations continues to be too extensive (sections  and ), including for example the objectives according to which organizations need to guarantee the production and distribution of goods and services at the correct price in accordance with the law, undertaking studies on the characteristics of the respective industrial branch, providing reports as requested by the authorities in conformity with the law, conducting campaigns to combat corruption actively, etc.The Committee observes that the new Act provides, as indicated above, that the logistical support of the CNE for the organization of elections is only provided at the request of the trade union executive boards. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that the CNE (which is not a judicial body) continues to be competent to examine any complaints which may be made by members. Furthermore, in breach of the principle of trade union independence, the text of the Act also maintains the principle that delays in the electoral process (including when complaints are lodged with the CNE) prevent the trade unions concerned from engaging in collective bargaining. The Act also imposes a system of ballots which includes the election of the executive board by single vote and proportional representation (section ), while the Act continues to require trade unions to provide to the authorities the complete list of their members, and to supply the competent officials with the information that they request on their statutory obligations (section ). The Act also interferes in numerous matters that should be regulated by union statutes, for example, by indicating that the purpose of collective bargaining is to achieve the objectives of the State (section ), the eligibility of trade union leaders is subject to them having called trade union elections within the time limits when",0,2011,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
49,"they were leaders of other organizations (section ), and a referendum is required to be held to revoke those holding trade union office (section ).The Committee further notes that, in the event of a strike, it is the competence of the People s Minister responsible for Labour (and not the judicial authorities or an independent body, particularly in the case of strikes in public enterprises or institutions) to determine the areas or activities which cannot be paralyzed during the strike on the grounds that they would affect the production of goods or essential services, the stoppage of which would harm the population (section ). The Committee notes the Government s statement that referring this to the judicial authorities would delay the right to strike. The Committee emphasizes that in the public sector the administrative authorities are an interested party in relation to the determination of minimum services. Furthermore, the system for the appointment of the members of arbitration boards in the event of strikes in essential services does not guarantee the confidence of the parties in the system since, where agreement is not reached by the parties, they are appointed by the labour inspector (section ). The Act also recognizes workers' councils, although their functions are not determined clearly, even though it is provided in the Act that they may not encroach upon the functions of trade unions. The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on this subject.Convention No. The Committee notes the adoption of new Basic Labour Act No.  of  May  concerning labour and [men and women] workers (LOTTT), which contains provisions providing full protection for workers against acts of anti-union discrimination and interference, with sufficiently dissuasive sanctions.Article  of the Convention. Pree and voluntary negotiation. The Committee observes that section  of the LOTTT provides that  discussion of proposals for collective bargaining shall take place in the presence of a labour official, who shall chair the meetings'  The Committee considers that this amounts to interference in the negotiations between the parties and is therefore contrary to the principles of free and voluntary negotiation and the autonomy of the parties. The Committee emphasizes the importance of amending this provision to bring it into full conformity with the abovementioned principles and requests the Government to indicate the measures taken or contemplated in this respect.Moreover, the Committee notes that section  concerning the registration of collective agreements states that  the labour inspector shall verify its conformity with the applicable public order regulations, with a view to granting approval'  Section  concerning the granting of approval states that  if the labour inspector considers it appropriate, he or she shall make the appropriate observations or recommendations to the parties instead of granting approval, and such observations and recommendations must be complied with within the next  working days'  The Committee recalls that, in general terms, making the entry into force of collective agreements concluded by the parties dependent on their approval by the authorities is contrary to the principles of collective bargaining established by Convention No. . The Committee considers that provisions of this sort are compatible with the Convention on condition that refusal of approval is restricted to cases in which the collective agreement contains flaws regarding its form or does not comply with the minimum standards laid down by the general labour legislation. The Committee requests the Government to provide further information on the scope of sections  and .Furthermore, the Committee notes that section  concerning mediation and arbitration states, with regard to bargaining by branch of activity, that  if conciliation is not possible, the labour official, at the request of the parties or on his or her own initiative, shall submit the dispute to arbitration unless the participating trade union organizations state their intention to exercise the right to strike'  The Committee further notes that section  states that  should a dispute be submitted to arbitration, an arbitration board composed of three members shall be established. One member shall be chosen by the employers from a list submitted by the workers; another shall be chosen by the workers from a list submitted by the employers; and the third member shall be chosen by mutual agreement. If no agreement is reached on nominations at the end of five successive days, the labour inspector shall designate the representatives'  The Committee recalls that arbitration ordered by the authorities should be restricted to essential services in the strict sense of the term and cases involving public servants exercising authority in the name of the State and considers that the designation of members by the labour inspector does not ensure that the parties will have confidence in the board that is established. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the measures contemplated to abolish arbitration ordered on the initiative of the authorities (except in the abovementioned cases) and to ensure that the composition of the arbitration board enjoys the confidence of the parties.
.The Committee considers it indispensable that the Government submit the legal provisions criticized above to tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of workers and employers with a view to bringing those provisions of the LOTTT into full conformity with Conventions Nos  and . The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures in this respect.
.The Committee wishes to emphasize that over the years when examining various complaints relating to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela it has noted the use in many cases of enabling legislation by the Legislative Assembly empowering the President of the Republic to adopt many decrees and laws which affect the interests of workers' and employers' organizations without a parliamentary debate being held. In the present case, through the enabling Act, the President of the Republic established a special Commission to draft the new LOTTT, however, alongside the various representatives of the state authorities it only included one representative of a workers' central organization (the representativeness and independence of which is questioned by the complainant organization APUCV) and a representative of an employers' federation (when there exists a more representative federation (FEDECAMARAS) in the country), with the result that the most representative organizations did not participate in the Commission. The Committee deeply deplores the situation so described and expects that, in future, in-depth consultations will be held with the most representative organizations of workers and employers on draft legislation covering labour or social matters which affect their interests and those of their members, prior to the drafting of the legislation, and that it is the Legislative Assembly, in the context of parliamentary debate, which adopts labour and social legislation.
.Under these conditions, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the principle that tripartite consultation should take place before the Government submits a draft to the Legislative Assembly or establishes a labour, social or economic policy, and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation on labour matters should be preceded by consultations with organizations of workers and employers [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee recalls that such consultations should be full, frank and detailed [see Digest, op. cit., paras ' ], and that the process of consultation on labour and minimum wages helps to give laws, programmes and measures adopted or applied by public authorities a firmer justification and helps to ensure that they are well respected and successfully applied. The Government should seek general consensus as much as possible, given that employers' and workers' organizations should be able to share in the responsibility of securing the well-being and prosperity of the community as a whole. This is particularly important given the growing complexity of the problems faced by societies. No public authority can claim to have all the answers, nor assume that all its proposals will naturally achieve all of their objectives [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to respect these principles in full in the future.
.Furthermore, although the Committee notes that the Government rejects all the allegations made by the complainant organization APUCV, it wishes to emphasize the gravity of the allegations relating to the criminalization of trade union activities through military tribunals, and in particular the detention and referral to military courts, including the requirement to report every week to the judicial military authorities, of five trade unionists in the construction sector (for having called for the payment of social benefits by a private enterprise Xocobeo CA, working under contract for the Ministry of Housing and the Environment), in addition, according to the allegations, to the hundred or so workers facing criminal charges for exercising their trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to reply to these allegations without delay.
.In light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Regretting that the Commission entrusted with drafting the new LOTTT excluded the most representative workers' and employers' organizations,",-1,2011,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
50,"the Committee requests the Government to submit to tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations of workers and employers the provisions of the LOTTT respecting freedom of association and collective bargaining criticized by the Committee of Experts with a view to bringing those provisions into full conformity with ILO Conventions Nos  and  and to keep it informed of developments in this respect. The Committee requests the Government to comply in future with the principles relating to consultation and social dialogue set out in its conclusions.(b)	The Committee emphasizes the gravity of the allegations relating to the criminalization of trade union activities through military tribunals, and in particular the detention and referral to military tribunals, and the imposition of the requirement to report periodically every week to the military judicial authorities, of five trade unionists in the construction sector (for having demanded the payment of social benefits by a private enterprise Xocobeo CA, working under contract for the Ministry of Housing and Environment), in addition, according to the allegations, to the hundred or so workers who have faced criminal charges for exercising their trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to reply to these allegations without delay.",1,2011,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
51,".At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. , adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )]:(a)	With regard to the allegations that, on  June , in Gurico State, a group led by the regional manager of INCES and various bosses travelling with him forced the national executive board of SINTRAINCES to move out of the INCES Gurico Socialist Training Centre that they had been visiting on that day for the purpose of hearing complaints from workers in the region, the Committee considers that, with the information provided by the complainant trade union, which indicates that the regional manager of INCES Gurico is responsible for the alleged incidents and the date, the Government should be able to get in touch with this manager and send his observations, and requests it to do so without delay.(b)	With regard to the allegation that the complainant trade union was given permission to hold an assembly of workers on  June , but that on that day the workers were prevented from entering the auditorium and were subsequently told to refrain from attending another assembly on  June  away from INCES premises, or face sanctions, the Committee, taking into account the request of the Government, requests the complainant trade union to provide additional information so that the Government can respond to the allegations, and in particular to indicate whether the alleged incidents were reported to the national authorities.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision that is handed down in the disciplinary proceedings against union officials Jos Alexander Meza and David Gregorio Duarte and underlines the importance of taking due account of the principle whereby no worker or union official should be the target of sanctions or prejudicial measures as a result of their participation in legitimate trade union activities.
.In its communications dated  June  and  January , the National Union of Workers of the National Institute for Socialist Training and Education (SINTRAINCES) (the complainant trade union in this case): (i) provides the additional information requested to support the allegation of the prohibition against participation in the assemblies of  and  June , including the circular of  June  from INCES indicating that the workers were not authorized to participate in the trade union meeting, with a warning of possible sanctions; (ii) alleges that, since the submission of the complaint in  and in relation with its activities, INCES has been engaging in anti-trade union practices, referring in particular to a campaign to disqualify the leaders and members of SINTRAINCES (including harassment through messages on social networks inciting hatred against the president of SINTRAINCES and the occupation of its building headquarters on  August  by workers apparently prompted by the president of INCES) and the establishment of a parallel trade union with close ties to the employing institution (SINCONTRAS-INCES); and (iii) indicates that although discussions to negotiate collectively were initiated in January , the INCES authorities made the discussion of the collective agreement conditional on the participation of the other trade union promoted and financed by the employing institution. Due to the pressure placed on it, SINTRAINCES had to accept the participation of this other trade union (despite the fact that the vast majority of the workers had objected to this dual participation), which had a negative effect on securing improvements to the clauses as the parallel trade union backed all the objections raised by the employing institution.
.The Government provides its observations in communications dated  May and  October  and  October .
.With regard to the allegation of the illegal removal of leaders and the failure to authorize assemblies, the Government indicates that it met with the INCES authorities, indicating to them that they should authorize the access of the trade union leaders to the facilities and the participation of workers in the assemblies organized by the trade unions as long as they do not affect the normal functioning of the institution. The Government specifies that it has no information that a similar situation has since occurred.
.With regard to the allegations of interference through another trade union, the Government maintains that it does not intervene in, or give its views on, the mutual accusations of both organizations and that it is a matter of an inter-union dispute. The Government recalls that the previous collective agreement was negotiated jointly by SINTRAINCES and SINCONTRAS-INCES and that this was made possible owing to an agreement between them (as there are no legal mechanisms to impose bargaining by two or more organizations).
.With regard to the disciplinary proceedings brought against the union officials Jos Alexander Meza and David Gregorio Duarte, the Government states that INCES launched an inquiry to determine the nature of a labour offence regarding activities unrelated to freedom of association. The Government indicates in this respect that: (i) the proceedings brought against Jos Alexander Meza were dismissed; and (ii) with regard to David Gregorio Duarte, INCES dropped the proceedings and the worker therefore remains active in his post.
.In its last communication, the Government underlines that in , SINTRAINCES proposed a collective agreement to be discussed with INCES. This proposal was accepted by the Labour Inspectorate and, following appropriate discussions, negotiations were completed on  September.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government: (i) the alleged disciplinary proceedings did not result in any measure being taken against the trade union leaders; (ii) measures were taken to ensure that the INCES authorities authorized the access of the trade union leaders to the facilities and the holding of assemblies by the institution s trade unions; and (iii) in , the complainant organization negotiated a new collective agreement with the employing institution. In these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this case.
.The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting and presented an interim report [see th Report of the Committee, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  October .
.In its previous examination of the case, in June , the Committee made the following recommendations on the issues that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:...(b)	The Committee requests the Government to respond to the allegations concerning the expulsion of the national executive board of the complainant trade union from the INCES Gurico Socialist Training Centre, as well as impediments to a trade union assembly and to the right to hold trade union meetings in Caracas.(c)	The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied concrete information on the events that might have led to disciplinary proceedings against two officials or trade union members and requests the Government to provide detailed observations on the dismissal procedure followed in the case of those two officials, and the events that might have led to the initiation of that procedure. The Committee recalls the principle whereby no worker or union official should be the target of sanctions or prejudicial measures as a result of their participation in legitimate trade union activities.(d)	The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that INCES initiates collective bargaining without delay with the complainant trade union....
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October , the Government reports that, on  August , a collective labour agreement concluded between the trade union organizations SINTRAINCES (the complainant organization in the present case) and the National Union of the Council of Socialist Workers of the National Institute for Socialist Training and Education (SINCONTRAS-INCES), and the employer, the National Institute for Socialist Training and Education (INCES), was approved.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the expulsion of the national executive board of the complainant trade union from the INCES Gurico Socialist Training Centre and the alleged impediments to holding a trade union assembly and trade union meetings in Caracas, the Government states that the Directorate of National Inspection and Other Collective Labour Issues in the Public Sector of the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour and Social Security reported that the files corresponding to the (complainant) organization SINTRAINCES contain no information on these matters. The Government asks the Committee on Freedom of Association to request the complainants to provide more detailed information in this regard, so that the Government can duly respond, since there is no evidence whatsoever of these alleged infringements with the competent State authorities.
.With regard to the allegation of the disciplinary proceedings taken against two officials and the events that might have led to them, the Government states that, according to the Directorate of Labour Relations of the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour and Social Security, as part of the procedure followed by INCES to determine misconduct, the employer alleged that the worker Jos Alexander Meza breached the rules of the",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
52,"institution and his obligations under existing labour laws, failing to fulfil his labour obligations, because in the course of the morning he suddenly and without justification left the workplace, without the prior authorization of his employer or the representative thereof; the employer also alleges that he stormed into the institute holding a placard that undermined its interests and had an impact on its organizational culture and institutional image, and that he disobeyed the orders and instructions issued by his supervisors by ignoring a memorandum stating that he could not leave the workplace during working hours. The Government states that the case is pending the outcome of two reports so that the appropriate administrative steps can be taken and the corresponding decision handed down.
.With regard to the dismissal procedure initiated by the representatives of INCES against David Gregorio Duarte, the Government states that the grounds for his dismissal fall under sections (b) and (c) of the former Organic Labour Act (repealed) and relate to dismissal for alleged libel against the institution and serious misconduct. The Government adds that the appropriate procedure was followed, the evidence was duly presented and the case was referred to the labour inspectorate for the corresponding decision, which is expected to be made at the end of October .
.With regard to recommendation (c), the Committee notes with interest that the complainant organization (SINTRAINCES) and the trade union SINCONTRAS-INCES concluded a collective agreement with INCES, which was approved on  August .
.With regard to the recommendation in which the Government is requested to respond to the allegations concerning the expulsion of the national executive board of the complainant trade union from the INCES Gurico Socialist Training Centre and the impediments to the right to hold trade union meetings in Caracas, the Committee takes note of the statements by the Government to the effect that the Directorate of National Inspection and Other Collective Labour Issues of the Public Sector of the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour and Social Security reported that the files corresponding to the (complainant) organization SINTRAINCES contain no information about these matters. The Government asks the Committee on Freedom of Association to request the complainants to provide more detailed information in this regard, so that the Government can duly respond, since there is no evidence of these alleged infringements with the competent State authorities.
.The Committee recalls that, according to the allegations in question [see th Report, para. ], on  June  in Gurico State, a group led by the regional manager of INCES and various bosses travelling with him forced the national executive board of SINTRAINCES to move out of the INCES Gurico Socialist Training Centre that they had been visiting on that day for the purpose of hearing complaints from workers in the region (according to these allegations, after an angry exchange, the trade union officials agreed to leave the Centre in order to avoid a violent turn of events).
.The Committee considers that with the information presented by the complainant union which indicates that the regional manager of INCES Gurico is responsible for the alleged incidents and the date, the Government should be able to get in touch with this manager and send his observations, and requests it to do so without delay. With regard to the allegation that the complainant organization was given permission to hold an assembly of workers on  June , but that on the day the workers were prevented from entering the auditorium and were subsequently told to refrain from attending another meeting on  June  away from INCES premises, or face sanctions, the Committee, taking into account the request of the Government, requests the complainant trade union to provide additional information so that the Government can respond to the allegations, and in particular to indicate whether the alleged incidents were reported to the national authorities.
.With regard to the disciplinary proceedings against trade union officials David Gregorio Duarte (Trujillo State) and Jos Alexander Meza (Tchira State) after they allegedly complained to the media or organized peaceful demonstrations in support of violated rights [see th Report, para. ], the Committee notes the statements made by the Government with regard to the procedure followed by INCES to determine misconduct, according to which the employer alleges that the worker Jos Alexander Meza breached the rules of the institution and his obligations under existing labour laws, failing to fulfil his labour obligations, given that in the course of the morning he suddenly and without justification left his workplace, without the prior authorization of his employer or the representative thereof; furthermore, the employer alleges that he stormed into the institute holding a placard that undermined its interests and had an impact on its organizational culture and institutional image, and that he disobeyed the orders and instructions issued by his supervisors by ignoring a memorandum stating that he could not leave the workplace during working hours. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the administrative case is pending the outcome of two reports and that once these are issued the appropriate decision will be handed down. The Committee underlines that the complaint was presented in  and regrets the excessive delay in the proceedings. The Committee requests the Government to send it the decision that is handed down by the administrative authority and expects that it will take into account the principle mentioned in its previous examination of the case, whereby no worker or union official should be the target of sanctions or prejudiced as a result of their participation in legitimate trade union activities.
.With regard to the disciplinary proceedings concerning the trade union official David Gregorio Duarte, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, dismissal proceedings are under way for alleged libel against INCES and serious misconduct, and that the case has been referred to the labour inspectorate for the corresponding decision, which is expected to be made at the end of October . The Committee underlines that the complaint was presented in  and regrets the excessive delay in the proceedings. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the decision that is handed down and stresses the importance of taking due account of the principle mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	With regard to the allegations that, on  June , in Gurico State, a group led by the regional manager of INCES and various bosses travelling with him forced the national executive board of SINTRAINCES to move out of the INCES Gurico Socialist Training Centre that they had been visiting on that day for the purpose of hearing complaints from workers in the region, the Committee considers that, with the information provided by the complainant trade union, which indicates that the regional manager of INCES Gurico is responsible for the alleged incidents and the date, the Government should be able to get in touch with this manager and send his observations, and requests it to do so without delay.(b)	With regard to the allegation that the complainant trade union was given permission to hold an assembly of workers on  June , but that on that day the workers were prevented from entering the auditorium and were subsequently told to refrain from attending another assembly on  June  away from INCES premises, or face sanctions, the Committee, taking into account the request of the Government, requests the complainant trade union to provide additional information so that the Government can respond to the allegations, and in particular to indicate whether the alleged incidents were reported to the national authorities.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision that is handed down in the disciplinary proceedings against union officials Jos Alexander Meza and David Gregorio Duarte and underlines the importance of taking due account of the principle whereby no worker or union official should be the target of sanctions or prejudicial measures as a result of their participation in legitimate trade union activities.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Union of Workers of the National Institute for Socialist Training and Education (SINTRAINCES) dated  December .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  December , SINTRAINCES states that its complaint relates to the National Institute for Socialist Training and Education (INCES), an autonomous institute chaired by the Minister of People s Power for Communes who is, in turn, part of the national Government, and that it is the most representative trade union in INCES since it has the largest membership, namely, , worker members, including civil servants, workers and retirees. The Institute employs over , workers.
.The complainant trade union alleges that, despite the activities and organization of SINTRAINCES in defence of workers' rights, the employer party,",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
53,"acting through its representatives, ignores or selectively recognizes the benefits set forth in the '  collective agreement of which clause  requires INCES to pay  travel allowances to its workers when they are required, in the course of their professional or trade union activities, to travel away from their workplaces'  in practice, INCES does not fully recognize this right when it rejects applications by SINTRAINCES to organize its assemblies and board meetings, or only partially complies on an exceptional basis. INCES also promotes and funds a parallel trade union called SINTRASEP INCES, which was founded later than the complainant trade union in December , and whose executive board is not elected but appointed by the employer party. INCES agreed to allocate resources to cover transfers and travel allowances for members of the parallel trade union. Furthermore, this trade union is, with the permission of the employer party, organizing campaigns to disqualify SINTRAINCES and its members and officials. The campaigns were stepped up in October and November  when libellous and slanderous messages were disseminated in all INCES branches nationwide.
.In this context, INCES is denying SINTRAINCES the spaces that have historically been used by workers and trade unions to organize meetings, workshops, assemblies and the like. Instead, it has worked with SINTRASEP INCES to provide covered facilities with seating for registering new members. INCES representatives have taken various measures to interfere with trade union activities, such as the following:' INCES managers have threatened and punished workers who attended SINTRAINCES meetings, and have therefore impeded the workers' right of assembly and their right to participate. Similarly, it has restricted and prevented travel by regional officials of the trade union, in violation of the clauses in the existing collective agreement that specify the employer party s financial contribution (travel allowance) to the cost of travel and assistance for regional officials attending national meetings;' INCES has banned the use of the meeting facilities (auditoriums, meeting rooms) that always used to be made available to the trade union for the purpose of holding meetings with workers, and even locked members out or forcibly expelled them from workplaces. On  June  in Gurico State, for example, a group led by the regional manager of INCES and various bosses travelling with him forced the national executive board of SINTRAINCES to move out of the INCES Gurico Socialist Training Centre that they had been visiting on that day for the purpose of hearing complaints from workers in the region. After an angry exchange, the trade union officials agreed to leave the Centre in order to avoid a violent turn of events. The trade union also submitted a written application on  May  (i.e. far enough in advance) for the use of the auditorium facilities at INCES headquarters in Caracas for the purpose of holding an assembly of workers on  June , and the application was granted. However, when the day of the assembly came, the workers were prevented from entering the auditorium and in response they held a peaceful demonstration that attracted media coverage. SINTRAINCES subsequently announced that a new assembly would be held on  June  away from INCES premises (in Generalsimo Francisco de Miranda park in Caracas) because of the refusal to allow the use of the Institute s facilities. As confirmed by communications from the human resources management department, the workers were told to refrain from attending or face sanctions. The workers were again invited to assemblies in each of the regional INCES branches on  October at  a.m., and the workers were again informed in writing that they were not permitted to attend.
.INCES has taken a number of measures of reprisal, including the following, against trade union members:' It initiated dismissal proceedings against SINTRAINCES officials (Mr David Duarte of Trujillo State, and Mr Job Alexander Meza of Tchira State) after they complained to the media and organized peaceful demonstrations in defence of labour rights; the proceedings are now at the decision stage in the Ministry of Labour;' it dismissed workers, including some who were entitled to immunity from dismissal (Ms Yesenia Cordero and Ms Desire Mendoza), on the grounds that they had attended SINTRAINCES meetings and supported the trade union (they were subsequently reinstated after their appeals were upheld);' SINTRAINCES officials from Tchira State (Mr Job Alexander Meza and Mr Wolfgang Crespo) were taking part in a peaceful demonstration in defence of labour rights when they were physically assaulted on  May  by a group of persons goaded on by the employer party. A complaint was lodged the same day with the Third Prosecutor s Office of the Public Prosecution Service in Tchira State (there has yet to be any practical follow-up on the complaint).
.Not only has the executive committee of INCES treated its workers, and SINTRAINCES in particular, in a discriminatory, unfair and threatening manner, it has also neglected its obligation as the employer party to deduct union dues and remit them to the trade union, as required by clause  of the existing collective agreement, in compliance with section  of the Labour Act, which is also in force.
.In spite of numerous communications transmitted by SINTRAINCES to the human resources directorate for it to update membership information, the directorate has failed to do so, invoking trivial excuses in the hope of stifling the trade union. On  February , an original document containing membership information on , workers, and indicating the first name and family name, identity card number, personal index code, job title, age, region and recruitment date of each of them, was transmitted to the directorate, which has refused to honour the commitments made in the collective agreement and with which it is legally bound to comply, in this case by deducting the dues of the workers in question. In addition to the update of membership information, SINTRAINCES also took the opportunity to request a change in the trade union dues since they had never been brought into line with the sum specified in the trade union s statutes, but no such change has been forthcoming.
.According to the complainant, the employer party has ordered regional managers to coerce workers into leaving SINTRAINCES and joining the parallel trade union by threatening them with sanctions and political blackmail or non-renewal of their contracts (in the case of workers with contracts). Many workers have been frightened and blackmailed into joining the parallel organization.
.INCES also intends to ignore SINTRAINCES as a legitimate representative of INCES workers in order to avoid discussing the collective labour agreement with representatives of that union. Instead, with a view to preventing discussion, the parallel trade union submitted a draft collective agreement after SINTRAINCES had submitted its own draft.
.According to the complainant, SINTRAINCES submitted the draft collective labour agreement for '  to the Ministry of People s Power for Labour and Social Security (MINPPTRASS) on  November  but it has so far proved impossible to initiate bargaining because of a clear failure by the Institute to comply with its obligation to negotiate, even though the trade union has faithfully adhered to the public sector collective bargaining procedure.
.As a result of the situations described above, that is, the labour breaches and violations, SINTRAINCES decided on  September  to initiate the established legal procedure for organizing a workers' strike by submitting to MINPPTRASS a document known as a  list of grievances'  However, both INCES and the Ministry of Labour have hindered the process by ignoring the principles set forth in the Constitution, the deadlines specified in labour legislation and international conventions.
.Furthermore, the complainant alleges that there has been an at least partial failure to comply with  clauses of the collective labour agreement for ' , which remains in force. The clauses in question are as follows:  (mutual respect);  (replacements);  (performance evaluation);  (industrial safety and health);  (toiletries);  (supply of milk);  (housing plan);  (individual development and training plan);  (vacation plan);  (recreational tourism and sports events);  (end-of-year party);  (recognition of merit);  (canteen services);  (sporting events);  (preparing workers for retirement);  (annual recreation and leisure plan for retirees and pensioners);  (comprehensive medical services at headquarters and in regional INCES branches);  (work involving the use of motor vehicles);  (travel allowances for trade union officials);  (overtime and additional payments);  (tax revenue staff productivity bonus);  (May Day celebration);  (work meetings); and  (trade union dues).
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states, with regard to the complainant s allegation concerning the promotion and funding of a parallel trade union, that the provisions of article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela stipulate that  Workers, without distinction of any kind and without need for authorization in advance, have the right freely to establish such union organizations as they may deem appropriate for the optimum protection of their rights and interests, as well as the right to join",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
54,"or not to join the same, in accordance with law. These organizations are not subject to administrative dissolution, suspension or intervention. Workers are protected against any act of discrimination or interference contrary to the exercise of this right ' ' Therefore, the complaint lodged against the Government by SINTRAINCES is inherently baseless and inconsistent given that the establishment of the collective entity known as the National Union of Public Sector Workers of the National Institute for Educational Cooperation (SINTRASEP INCE NACIONAL), like that of any trade union organization, is merely the result of the workers' desire to set up a new trade union organization for the optimum protection of their labour rights and interests.
.The Government adds that it considers the arguments deployed by SINTRAINCES to be false and baseless, and emphatically states that the employer party, namely, INCES, has respected the rights of the trade union organizations SINTRAINCES and SINTRASEP INCE NACIONAL in a completely impartial manner. Similarly, the Government denies the allegation that INCES does not pay travel allowances to SINTRAINCES officials for them to take part in trade union activities, and likewise denounces the politically motivated attempts by the complainants to blame it for the hostile actions taken by the abovementioned trade unions against one another or against any other trade union organization in the heat of the trade union struggle.
.By the same token, the Government denies that INCES, acting through its directors, threatens and sanctions workers who attend assemblies organized by SINTRAINCES. It also denies that travel by regional trade union officials is restricted or banned, and argues that the claim that they are deprived of any financial assistance on the part of the employer party (travel allowances) is completely without foundation.
.As for the claim that the employer entity does not allow the use of meeting rooms for trade union activities and prevents meetings from taking place, the Government states that, two years ago, SINTRAINCES was given full access by INCES to premises in the Arauca building between Avenue Roosevelt and Nueva Granada in the parish of Santa Rosala, which is part of the Libertador municipality in Caracas, and it has been able to pursue its trade union activities there rather than in many of the rooms and halls located in the various INCES headquarters which were converted into shelters that now house many of the victims made homeless by the heavy rains that have hit the country in . It also notes that it is deliberately misleading of SINTRAINCES to quote a communication from the general manager of human resources, dated  June , addressed to general and regional managers and intended to specify that staff were not permitted to leave their workplaces. The trade union was invited to apply, as usual, for the corresponding authorization at least  hours in advance. Indeed, this is the usual practice for the employer party. The request was denied at the time not only because it came at such short notice but also because it was well known that the abovementioned premises had been available for meetings since .
.The Government also denies the baseless claims of SINTRAINCES to the effect that INCES has taken measures of reprisal against some of its members on the grounds that it was an organization fighting for and defending human labour rights. Any dismissal proceedings affecting a worker must comply with the legislation in force and under no circumstances can they be the result of a reprisal against trade union activities. The corresponding administrative procedures comply in practice with the relevant national legislation.
.The Government emphatically rejects the allegation that the employer party interfered with the operations of the trade union organization because at no time has INCES failed to meet its obligation to deduct ordinary and extraordinary dues, as specified in the union s statutes, from the salaries of workers who are members of SINTRAINCES. On the contrary, INCES is aware of the rights of trade union organizations and has always deducted the trade union dues in question and remitted the corresponding sums not only to SINTRAINCES but also to all the other trade union organizations active within the Institute.
.It should also be noted that the delay in deducting the trade union dues owed to SINTRAINCES, which have now been paid in full, cannot now be and never could have been blamed on the employer party, because the executive committee of that union belatedly provided INCES with incomplete documentation for that purpose, especially in the case of new members and when changes were made to the level of union dues, thereby violating the provisions of clause  of the existing collective labour agreement. The Government states that it denies the inaccurate and utterly baseless allegations that INCES, acting through its managers, coerced workers into leaving SINTRAINCES.
.The Government rejects the false accusation that INCES impeded the right to strike. Indeed, it appears that the executive committee of that union is unaware that labour legislation stipulates that before the right to strike can be exercised, all opportunities for conciliation provided by the law and agreed upon in existing collective labour agreements must first be exhausted. The allegation by SINTRAINCES that its right to strike is being impeded is thus baseless and inconsistent, since that trade union organization has submitted a list of grievances to MINPPTRASS, which accepted and is currently processing the list in compliance with the Labour Act and the corresponding regulations. At its first meeting before the Conciliation Board, the representative of the employer party raised objections and made allegations that were ruled inadmissible in reasoned Order No. - by the competent authority, in accordance with the existing legal procedure in this area. Bargaining was ordered to resume and conciliatory bargaining is ongoing before the Directorate of Mediation, Conciliation and Arbitration of MINPPTRASS.
.Regarding the alleged refusal to negotiate a collective agreement, the Government states that the claim by the trade union organization that the employer party has refused to engage in collective bargaining is completely false. Contrary to the allegations made by SINTRAINCES, three draft collective labour agreements were submitted to MINPPTRASS by various trade union organizations active in INCES, namely, SINTRAINCES, SINTRASEP INCE NACIONAL, and the National Union of the Socialist Workers' Council of the National Institute for Socialist Training and Education (SINCONTRAS INCES), with a view to their being debated with INCES.
.In the light of the above, the Government states that the draft collective labour agreement submitted by SINTRASEP INCE NACIONAL was rejected on the grounds that its supporters did not meet the admissibility requirements. However, the draft collective labour agreements submitted by the other trade union organizations that are active in INCES (SINTRAINCES and SINCONTRAS INCES) were accepted by the Directorate for the National Inspectorate and Other Collective Labour Issues in the Public Sector, which demanded that INCES should commission the corresponding comparative economic studies for submission to the Ministry of People s Power for Planning and Finance (MPPPF) since the collective bargaining in question was taking place in the public sector. That administrative body would then produce the mandatory report required for bargaining to commence in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Labour Act regulations, without prejudice to the start of bargaining with the most representative trade union organization. That being so, it should also be noted that the existence of two draft collective labour agreements submitted by two different trade union organizations for discussion with a single employer (INCES) means that the competent labour inspector is authorized, under article  of the Labour Act regulations, to organize a referendum in order to determine which of the applicant collective entities represents the majority of workers concerned, and thus which one has the legitimacy to discuss the INCES collective labour agreement.
.As for the allegation that there has been a failure to comply with clauses of the '  collective agreement, the Government states that it has repeatedly and consistently complied with the clauses of the collective labour agreement currently in force at INCES, and points out that, in compliance with the law, a conciliatory list of grievances submitted by SINTRAINCES to MINPPTRASS is now being processed, responses have been given to most of the points raised by the applicants regarding the failure to comply with clauses of the collective labour agreement currently in force, and there are now only two aspects that remain to be resolved, namely, the annual recreation and leisure plan for retirees and pensioners, since the retirees and pensioners have not decided which recreation activities are to take place, and the tax revenue staff productivity bonus, since payment of the bonus is dependent on surplus tax revenue.
.The Committee observes that, in its complaint, the complainant trade union (SINTRAINCES) alleges: () a failure to comply with  clauses of the '  collective labour agreement by INCES, with particular reference to impediments to the deduction of trade union dues, and the clause of the collective agreement that relates to the payment of travel allowances to trade union representatives when they are required, in the performance of",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
55,"their duties, to travel away from their workplaces; () the promotion and operation of a parallel trade union that conducts campaigns of defamation against the complainant, and the instruction given by INCES to its regional managers requiring them to coerce workers into leaving the complainant trade union and joining the parallel trade union promoted by the employer; () the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against two officials of the complainant trade union, and the dismissal of two (subsequently reinstated) workers on the grounds that they had supported the complainant trade union; () physical assaults on two officials of the complainant trade union in Tchira State; and () delays and impediments to the exercise of the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike.
.Regarding the alleged total or partial failure to comply with  clauses of the '  collective labour agreement, which remains in force, the Committee notes that the Government states that it has repeatedly and consistently complied with the clauses of the collective labour agreement currently in force at INCES, and points out that, in compliance with the law, a conciliatory list of grievances submitted by SINTRAINCES to MINPPTRASS is now being processed, responses have been given to most of the points raised by the applicants regarding the failure to comply with clauses of the collective labour agreement currently in force, and there are now only two aspects that remain to be resolved, namely, the annual recreation and leisure plan for retirees and pensioners, since the retirees and pensioners have not decided which recreation activities are to take place, and the tax revenue staff productivity bonus, since payment of the bonus is dependent on the surplus tax revenue. Given that the official complaint concerning the failure to comply with clauses of the collective agreement was made by the complainant trade union in September , the Committee emphasizes the importance of prompt examination by the authorities of complaints concerning a failure to comply with collective agreements. The Committee notes that the Government points out that only two of the aspects previously mentioned in connection with the failure to comply with the collective agreement remain to be resolved, and firmly expects that full compliance with the collective agreement will be ensured in the case of those two aspects.
.Regarding the alleged impediments to the deduction of the dues of members of the complainant trade union, in violation of clause  of the collective agreement and article  of the Labour Act, the Committee observes that the complainant trade union denounces not only the refusal by the authorities to update the membership information transmitted by the complainant trade union in spite of having received all the necessary data, but also the refusal by INCES to bring the dues into line with the sum specified in the trade union s statutes. The Committee notes that the Government states that: () at no time has INCES failed to meet its obligation to deduct ordinary and extraordinary dues, as specified in the union s statutes, from the salaries of workers who are members of SINTRAINCES since, on the contrary, it is aware of the rights of trade union organizations and has always deducted the trade union dues in question and remitted the corresponding sums not only to SINTRAINCES but also to all the other trade union organizations active within the Institute; and () the delay in deducting the trade union dues owed to SINTRAINCES, which have now been paid in full, cannot now be and never could have been blamed on the employer party, because the executive committee of that union violated the provisions of clause  of the existing collective labour agreement by belatedly providing INCES with incomplete documentation for that purpose, especially in the case of new members and when changes were made to the level of union dues. The Committee notes that although the complainant trade union and the Government have differing opinions regarding the blame for the delays in deductions, the Government s statements indicate that the former problems with the deduction of trade union dues and the levels of those dues have now been overcome. Consequently, the Committee will not pursue the examination of these issues unless the complainant trade union provides new evidence.
.Regarding the alleged failure to comply with the collective agreement in connection with the payment of travel allowances to enable trade union officials to perform their duties away from their workplaces, the Committee notes that the complainant organization states that INCES has refused to pay travel allowances for the organization of assemblies and board meetings and paid them only partially and on an exceptional basis, and refers to the failure to pay travel allowances to cover the cost of travel and assistance for regional officials attending national meetings. The Committee does, however, note that the Government denies these allegations, states that they are completely without foundation, and rejects the claim that any restrictions have been placed on travel by regional officials. The Committee observes that the attachments transmitted by the complainant trade union do not mention any specific cases but do allude to an INCE memorandum in which it is stated that the trade union organization failed to make arrangements in advance for (trade union) leave with the highest authorities. In these conditions, the Committee concludes that it is not aware of specific examples that might enable it to note violations of the clauses of the collective agreement in the area of trade union leave.
.Regarding the alleged promotion and funding of a parallel trade union (SINTRASEP INCE NACIONAL) whose executive board is allegedly not elected but appointed by INCE, and which is allegedly treated more favourably by INCE, to the detriment of the complainant trade union (when, for example, rooms for trade union assemblies and meetings are made available not to the complainant trade union but to the parallel one), the Committee takes note of the Government s statements to the effect that the alleged parallel trade union (SINTRASEP INCE NACIONAL) was established by workers of their own volition within the context of the right of freedom of association enshrined in the Constitution. Similarly, the Committee notes that the Government: () denies all interference or partiality by INCES, that the complainant trade union is denied access to rooms in which to carry out trade union activities, that its meetings are prevented, or that workers who attend assemblies of the complainant trade union are threatened or sanctioned; and () states that two years ago INCES gave SINTRAINCES full access to premises in the Arauca building between Avenue Roosevelt and Nueva Granada in the parish of Santa Rosala, which is part of the Libertador municipality in Caracas, and that it has been able to pursue its trade union activities there, bearing in mind that many of the rooms and halls located in the various INCES headquarters were converted into shelters that now house many of the victims made homeless by the heavy rains that have hit the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in . The Committee stresses that SINTRAINCES should be treated on an equal footing with the other unions of JNCE in terms of use of rooms for trade union activities.
.Regarding the alleged prevention of board meetings and trade union assemblies, the Committee takes note that the Government highlights the need for the trade union to submit its application for the organization of meetings at least  hours in advance, and further states that the trade union has had access to a meeting room since . However, the Committee observes that the Government has not responded to the specific allegations according to which: () the executive board of the parallel trade union was not elected but appointed by INCE; () on  June , in Gurico State, a group led by the regional manager of INCES and various bosses travelling with him forced the national executive board of SINTRAINCES to move out of the INCES Gurico Socialist Training Centre that they had been visiting on that day for the purpose of hearing complaints from workers in the region; after an angry exchange of words, the trade union officials agreed to leave the Centre in order to avoid a violent situation; and () the complainant trade union submitted a written application on  May  (i.e. far enough in advance) for the use of the auditorium facilities at INCES headquarters in Caracas for the purpose of holding an assembly of workers on  June , and the application was granted. However, when the day of the assembly came, the workers were prevented from entering the auditorium and in response they held a peaceful demonstration that attracted media coverage; SINTRAINCES subsequently announced that a fresh assembly would be held on  June  away from INCES premises (in Generalsimo Francisco de Miranda park in Caracas) because of the refusal to allow the use of the Institute s facilities, and the fact that the workers were told to refrain from attending or face sanctions; the workers were again invited to assemblies in",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
56,"each of the regional INCES branches on  October at  a.m., and the workers were again informed in writing that they were not permitted to attend. The Committee recalls that Article  of Convention No.  enshrines the principle of non-interference by the authorities with the activities of trade union organizations and requests the Government to respond to these allegations.
.Regarding the alleged anti-union reprisals against officials and members of the complainant trade union (dismissal of Ms Yesenia Cordero and Ms Desire Mendoza on the grounds that they had attended union meetings and supported the trade union, although they were subsequently reinstated after their appeals were upheld, and dismissal proceedings initiated against trade union officials Mr David Duarte of Trujillo State and Mr Job Alexander Meza of Tchira State after they complained to the media or organized peaceful demonstrations in support of labour rights), the Committee notes that the Government denies the accusations made by the trade union organization known as SINTRAINCES and claiming that INCES took measures of reprisal against some of its members on the grounds that it was an organization fighting for and defending human labour rights, meaning that any dismissal proceedings affecting a worker must comply with the legislation in force and under no circumstances can they be the result of a reprisal against trade union activities; the corresponding administrative procedures comply in practice with relevant national legislation.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information on the events that might have led to the dismissals of two (subsequently reinstated) trade union members, or on disciplinary proceedings against two other officials or trade union members. The Committee recalls the principle whereby no worker or union official should be the target of sanctions or prejudiced as a result of their participation in legitimate trade union activities, and requests the Government to provide detailed observations on the dismissal procedure followed in the case of those two trade union officials, and the events that might have led to the initiation of that procedure.
.Regarding the alleged refusal to negotiate a collective agreement, the Committee takes note of the fact that the Government states that the claim by the trade union organization that the employer party has refused to engage in collective bargaining is completely false; contrary to the allegations made by SINTRAINCES, three draft collective labour agreements were submitted to MINPPTRASS by various trade union organizations active in INCES, namely, SINTRAINCES, SINTRASEP INCE NACIONAL, and SINCONTRAS INCES, with a view to their being debated with INCES. Similarly, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the draft collective labour agreement submitted by SINTRASEP INCE NACIONAL (which is considered to be a parallel trade union by the complainant organization) was rejected on the grounds that its supporters did not meet the admissibility requirements, whereas the draft collective labour agreements submitted by the other trade union organizations that are active in INCES (SINTRAINCES and SINCONTRAS INCES) were accepted by the Directorate for the National Inspectorate and Other Collective Labour Issues in the Public Sector, which demanded that INCES should commission the corresponding comparative economic studies for submission to MPPPF since the collective bargaining in question was taking place in the public sector, so that that administrative body could then produce the mandatory report required for bargaining to commence in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Labour Act regulations, without prejudice to the start of bargaining with the most representative trade union organization. The Committee also notes that the Government points out that the existence of two draft collective labour agreements submitted by two different trade union organizations for discussion with a single employer (INCES) means that the competent labour inspector is authorized, under article  of the Labour Act regulations, to organize a referendum in order to determine which of the applicant collective entities represents the majority of workers concerned, and thus which one has the legitimacy to discuss the INCES collective labour agreement.
.The Committee wishes to emphasize that, as is made clear by the complaint of the complainant organization and the documentation provided, the complainant trade union submitted a draft collective labour agreement for '  in November , and notes that, as mentioned by the complainant trade union, negotiations have yet to begin. The Committee wishes to stress that neither the Government s argument that economic studies need to be carried out by MPPPF nor the argument that a referendum needs to be organized in order to determine which of the trade union organizations represents the majority of workers can justify a delayed start to negotiations. The Committee further observes that the Government has not denied the claim by the complainant trade union that it is the most representative organization since it has , members out of the more than , workers in INCES. That being so, the Committee considers that there is no need in this case to organize a referendum in order to determine the most representative trade union organization.
.Given these conditions, the Committee reminds the Government that Article  of Convention No.  stipulates that measures appropriate to national conditions should be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation, with a view to the regulation of conditions of employment by means of collective agreements, and that the excessive delay in the holding of negotiations over the draft collective agreement is a violation of Article  of the Convention, and is particularly serious when the employer is a public institution, which should ensure the observance of freedom of association and collective bargaining principles. The Committee deeply regrets the excessive delay in the collective bargaining and reminds the Government that the principle that both employers and trade unions should negotiate in good faith and make efforts to reach an agreement means that any unjustified delay in the holding of negotiations should be avoided [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ], and urges it to take the necessary steps to ensure that INCES initiates collective bargaining without delay with the complainant trade union.
.Regarding the alleged impediments to the exercise of the right to strike by INCES, the Committee notes that, according to the allegations, on  September  the complainant trade union initiated the established legal procedure for organizing a strike by submitting a list of grievances to the Ministry in the light of the problems addressed in the present complaint, including the authorities' attitude to collective bargaining. The procedure was allegedly impeded both by the Ministry and by INCES since the deadlines stipulated in the legislation were not met. The Committee notes that, in its reply, Government rejects this accusation on the grounds that it is false and that labour legislation stipulates that before the right to strike can be exercised, the conciliation procedures provided by the law and agreed upon in existing collective labour agreements must first be exhausted; the Government s point of view is that the allegation by the SINTRAINCES trade union that its right to strike is being impeded is thus baseless and inconsistent, since that trade union organization has submitted a conciliatory list of demands to MIPPTRASS, which accepted and is currently processing the list in compliance with the Labour Act and the corresponding regulations; at its first meeting before the Conciliation Board, the representatives of the employer party raised objections and made allegations that were ruled inadmissible in reasoned Order No. - by the competent authority, bargaining was ordered to resume and conciliatory bargaining is ongoing before the Directorate of Mediation, Conciliation and Arbitration of MIPPTRASS. The Committee notes that the Government adds that most of the points relating to the failure to comply with the collective agreement in the complainant trade union s list of complaints have been resolved and only two aspects (already mentioned earlier in the conclusions) remain to be resolved.
.The Committee duly notes the Government s point of view according to which procedures for conciliation must first be exhausted before a strike can be declared but wishes to emphasize that, bearing in mind the fact that conciliation began in  and is still ongoing, that the time frames for conciliation must be reasonable and must not prevent the exercise of the right to strike. The Committee states in this connection that although a strike may be temporarily restricted by law until all procedures available for negotiation, conciliation and arbitration have been exhausted, such a restriction should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Under these conditions, the Committee regrets that the complainant organization has not been able, after a reasonable period of conciliation, to exercise the right to strike enshrined in the legislation, and requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the competent authority respects the abovementioned principles in future.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
57,"Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee underlines the importance of ensuring that complaints concerning a failure to comply with collective agreements are examined rapidly by the authorities and firmly expects that the collective agreement will be effectively complied with in the case of the last two remaining unresolved issues.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to respond to the allegations concerning the expulsion of the national executive board of the complainant trade union from the INCES Gurico Socialist Training Centre, as well as impediments to a trade union assembly and to the right to hold trade union meetings in Caracas.(c)	The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied concrete information on the events that might have led to disciplinary proceedings against two officials or trade union members and requests the Government to provide detailed observations on the dismissal procedure followed in the case of those two officials, and the events that might have led to the initiation of that procedure. The Committee recalls the principle whereby no worker or union official should be the target of sanctions or prejudicial measures as a result of their participation in legitimate trade union activities.(d)	The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that INCES initiates collective bargaining without delay with the complainant trade union.(e)	Regretting that the complainant organization has not been able, after a reasonable period of conciliation (starting in ), to exercise the right to strike, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that, in future, the competent authority respects the principles mentioned in the conclusions, according to which excessive time frames for conciliation make it impossible, in practice, to exercise the right to strike.",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
58,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) Bearing in mind the considerable delay in the negotiation process, the Committee expects the collective agreement between SUNEP-CVG and the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana to be signed as soon as possible and once again requests the Government to keep it informed of developments without delay.(b) Regarding the alleged (provisional) arrest and criminal prosecution of SUTRA-CVG union officials Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada and of trade unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez, the Committee urges the Government once again to draw the judicial authority s attention without delay to the need for it to take duly into account the fact that the trade unionists concerned were engaged in a peaceful demonstration to demand compliance with the collective agreement, and requests the Government to communicate to it without delay the sentence that is handed down.(c) Regarding the alleged criminal prosecution of SUTISS-Bolvar union leaders (Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez) and the criminal prosecution of employees of Camila CA in  (Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez), the Committee requests the Government to communicate to it without delay the sentence handed down on the said union leaders and employees and, bearing in mind that the incidents date back to  and that the trade unionists involved are required periodically to present themselves before the judicial authority, trusts that the sentence will be handed down very soon. The Committee recalls that a delay in the administration of justice is tantamount to a denial of justice.(d) Regarding the alleged brutal repression by the national guard and police of the State of Bolvar of a gathering of steelworkers from Ternium-Sidor who were demanding improvements to the collective agreement under negotiation, which resulted in injuries to several people, dozens of criminal prosecutions and the destruction by the authorities of  vehicles belonging to the workers (according to the Government, a group of some  workers was blocking the traffic with private vehicles, burning tyres and throwing heavy objects at members of the national guard unit, injuring several officers), the Committee takes note that the judicial authority ordered the unconditional release of the workers who had been charged and again requests the Government to conduct an inquiry without delay into the allegations that the police used excessive force and caused serious injuries and damage to property.(e) The Committee regrets once again the delay in the criminal proceedings brought against the trade union leader Mr Rubn Gonzlez (which have resulted in repeated restrictions of his free movement) and requests the Government to provide it with a copy of the judgment that is handed down after the initial sentence was declared null and void by the Supreme Court of Justice because it lacked sufficient grounds. Finally, the Committee reiterates the recommendation it made when it first examined the case, considering that the charges against Ruben Gonzlez do not justify his preventive detention or house arrest for years prior to the present interim measures, and requests the Government that he be compensated for the damages suffered.
.The Committee notes a communication dated  May  signed by many organizations expressing their support for the complaint presented by the Venezuelan Corporation of Guyana (SUNEP CVG).
.In its communication dated  October , the Government informs the Committee that the criminal prosecution of SUTRA CVG trade union leaders, Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada, and trade unionists, Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez, is at the preparatory stage, where the necessary and relevant steps are being carried out in order for the final report to be issued (the Committee recalls that the said defendants, who are not incarcerated, were charged with unlawful association and restricting freedom of work). The Committee regrets that to date the Government has not been able to provide information that a judgment has been handed down in relation to those trade unionists despite the time that has elapsed. Further, the Committee recalls that in its previous examination of the case, it urged the Government to draw the judicial authority s attention without delay to the need for it to take duly into account the fact that the trade unionists concerned were engaged in a peaceful demonstration to demand compliance with the collective agreement. The Committee reiterates the conclusions it reached when it previously examined the case and requests the Government to communicate without delay the judgment handed down in relation to those trade unionists.
.Regarding the criminal prosecution of trade union leaders and trade unionists from SUTISS olvar, Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez, and of workers of the Camila CA enterprise, Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez in , the Government reports that the Second Attorney-General s Office of the Second Judicial Circuit of Bolvar State and the th Attorney-General s Office at the national level with full competence submitted charges and that the public oral hearing was scheduled for  October  (the Committee recalls that the defendants, who are not incarcerated, were charged with second-degree misappropriation of funds, restricting freedom of work and taking the law into their own hands). The Committee regrets that to date the Government has not sent any up-to-date information on the proceedings concerning the facts dating from . The Committee once again requests the Government to provide without delay information on the decision handed down in relation to the said trade unionists.
.The Committee recalls that, in its previous examinations of the case, it had requested that the Government carry out an investigation into the allegation that the police used excessive force on  March  against a gathering of steelworkers from Ternium Sidor who were calling for improvements to the collective bargaining, which allegedly resulted in serious injuries and property damage (according to the allegations, the authorities destroyed  vehicles). The Committee notes that the Government states that no criminal investigation was ever launched because the Public Prosecutor s Office was never informed of those facts. The Committee invites the complainant to provide information to allow the Government to carry out an impartial investigation into the facts and to specify, in particular, whether the instances of serious injury and property damage were reported to the police.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government reports that, on  April , the th Court of Justice of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas handed down a final judgment which acquitted trade union leader Rubn Gonzlez. The Government also reports that while the legal proceedings were in progress, Gonzlez enjoyed full trade union rights, freely participated in the General Workers Union of Ferrominera Orinoco (SINTRAFERROMINERA) trade union elections, in which he was elected as the general secretary, and represented his trade union in discussions regarding the collective labour agreement. The Committee requests the Government to supply a copy of the said judgment and to provide information on whether the trade union leader Rubn Gonzlez has been compensated for the damages he suffered during the preventive detention and house arrest to which he had been subject since September .
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided information on the negotiation process between the trade union SUNET CVG and la Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana, and requests the Government once again to keep it informed on the matter.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  and June  meetings and presented an interim report to the Governing Body in June  [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  October  and  March .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case at its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the issues that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	In view of the lengthy delay in the bargaining process, the Committee expects that the collective agreement between the SUNEP CVG and the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) will be signed as soon as possible and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b)	With regard to the allegations concerning the (temporary) detention and criminal prosecution of the SUTRA CVG union leaders Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada and unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez, the Committee again urges the Government to draw to the attention of the judicial authority the need to give due consideration to the fact that the trade unionists in question were staging a peaceful protest calling for the enforcement of the collective agreement",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
59,"and requests the Government to communicate the judgment handed down in relation to these trade unionists.(c)	With regard to the allegations concerning the criminal prosecution of the SUTISS Bolvar trade union leaders Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez, and the criminal prosecution in  of the employees of the enterprise Camila CA Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez, the Committee requests the Government to communicate without delay the judgment handed down in regard to these trade union leaders and workers and, in view of the fact that the events in question date back to , and that these trade unionists are required to report periodically to the court, expects that the judgment will be handed down in the near future. In this regard, the Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.(d)	With regard to the allegation that, on  March , the national guard and the Bolvar State Police brutally repressed a gathering of steelworkers from Ternium Sidor who were calling for improvements to the collective agreement that was being negotiated, resulting in several wounded, dozens of criminal prosecutions and the destruction by the authorities of  vehicles belonging to the workers, the Committee, noting once again that, according to the Government, a group of some  workers was blocking the traffic with cars and burning tyres and throwing heavy objects at the members of the national guard unit, injuring several officers, once again requests the Government to supply a copy of the judgment that is handed down, notes the delay in the judicial proceedings and requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations concerning the excessive use of public force which resulted in serious injuries and property damage.(e)	The Committee regrets the delay in the criminal proceedings relating to the trade union leader Rubn Gonzlez (currently on parole) and the lack of adequate grounds for the judgment handed down by the judge in the case, and requests the Government to inform it of the new criminal judgment to be handed down. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation, considering that the charges against this leader do not justify his preliminary detention or house arrest since September , and requests that he be appropriately compensated for the damages suffered.
.In its communication of  October  the Government refers in detail to the proceedings initiated against Rubn Gonzlez, who on  September  was accused by the Attorney-General s Office of committing crimes against public order, including incitement to break the law, unlawful association, restriction of the freedom of work and non-compliance with special security zone regulations (Case No. -F-C-- initiated by the Third Office of the Attorney General of the Second Judicial District Circuit of the State of Bolvar). The court hearing began  November  and on  February , the Sixth Tribunal of the State of Bolvar sentenced the General Secretary of the Union of Workers of Ferrominera Orinoco, Rubn Gonzlez, to seven years in prison.
.On  March , the Criminal Appeals Court of the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) revoked the sentence against Rubn Daro Gonzlez Rojas handed down in the first instance by the Sixth Tribunal of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the State of Bolvar, called for a public retrial by a different court of justice and for a new sentence, on the grounds that there were a number of procedural errors in the sentence handed down by the court of first instance, and ordered interim measures to be adopted instead of preventive detention, pursuant to article  () and () of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the interim measures consisted of a requirement that he report to the judicial authorities every two weeks and a ban on his leaving the country.
.Regarding the complainants' written allegations of  March  (referred to in the Committee s previous examination of the case) and in the light of the foregoing, the Government rejects any accusation that it exercises control over the judiciary or over any other state institution. As stated in the Constitution, the state authority is vested in the legislature, the judiciary, the executive, the citizenry and the electorate, and the principle of the separation of powers is fully applied. Consequently, the judiciary is independent and its various bodies are mandated to hear complainants and other matters falling within its competence, under proceedings laid down by law, and to enforce its rulings or have them enforced.
.In their written allegations the complainants claim that the Criminal Court of the Supreme Court of Justice dealt with their complaint  at top speed' and draw attention to certain aspects that they qualify as  a manoeuvre by the Criminal Court'  The Government wishes to make the following observations.
.Article  of the Organic Act of the Supreme Court of Justice stipulates that any of its chambers may, on matters within its purview and mandate and at their own discretion or at the request of a party, after having briefly considered the situation, request any file as it stands from any court in order to determine whether it will deal with the case, or assign it to another court.
.In the exercise of this legal power, therefore, the Criminal Appeals Court of the Supreme Court of Justice handed down a ruling on  March , by which it ordered the Sixth Tribunal of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the State of Bolvar, to turn the case against Rubn Daro Gonzlez Rojas over to it along with all the pertinent documents.
.The transferral of a case from one court to another is a legal device embodied in the Organic Act establishing the Supreme Court of Justice that empowers the Court, at its own discretion or at the request of a party, to take over a case at the point at which it stands and issue its own ruling.
.The Criminal Appeals Court accordingly examined the case that had been brought against Rubn Gonzlez before the court of first instance and ruled that the sentence handed down by the Sixth Tribunal of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the State of Bolvar lacked sufficient grounds, a procedural error that is in violation of the principles and guarantees, such as access to justice and due process, that are embodied in articles  and . of the Constitution. It therefore declared the sentence handed down by the Sixth Tribunal to be null and void.
.Since the sentence handed down by the Sixth Tribunal was declared null and void, the case was transferred to another court of justice to hold a public trial and hand down a new sentence taking due account of the procedural error that had occurred.
.The Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, in accordance with the principle of freedom and proportionality laid down in articles  and  of the Code of Criminal Procedure, exercised its discretion to revoke the preventive detention ordered against the defendant. In affirmation of the principle of freedom whereby, except as stipulated by law, any person charged with the commission of a punishable offence is entitled to be judged as a free man (such freedom being the rule and preventive detention exceptional), the Criminal Chamber considered, and so ruled, that the outcome of the trial could be duly guaranteed if the preventive detention was replaced by the imposition of less constraining measures such as the interim measures provided for in article  () and () of the Code of Criminal Procedure, requiring that Rubn Daro Gonzlez Rojas report to the judicial authorities every two weeks and prohibiting him from leaving the country.
.The Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice declared further that the trial of Rubn Daro Gonzlez Rojas had disturbed the tranquillity and daily life of the State of Bolvar and, in order to maintain the purpose of established criminal proceedings and to ensure that justice was applied responsibly and swiftly, the Chamber decided exceptionally to withdraw the case from the courts within whose jurisdiction it would normally fall and to transfer it to a different criminal circuit court (in the metropolitan area of Caracas), so that the trial could continue in full respect of constitutional rights and guarantees, pursuant to article  of the Organic Act establishing the Supreme Court of Justice.
.In the light of the foregoing, the Government rejects the allegation of  March  presented by the complainant trade union and the accusations it contains and informs the Committee on Freedom of Association that, as in the past, it will keep it informed of the outcome of this case. The Government repeats that the defendant in the case is currently free pending notification of the date of the court hearing.
.The Government wishes to inform the Committee on Freedom of Association that it has examined carefully and taken due note of all the recommendations formulated by the Committee in its th Report. However, since the case refers to matters that are being investigated by different units",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
60,"of the Attorney-General s Office, the information that the Committee sought from the Government in recommendations (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph  of the report has been requested from the Attorney-General s Office and shall be passed on to the Committee as soon as possible.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government refers to the allegations concerning union members of SUTISS Bolvar (Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez) and employees of Camila CA (Richard Daz, Osmel Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdamatir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Anzola, Argenis Godofredo Cmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez) and states that they were charged with second-degree misappropriation of funds, restricting the freedom of work and taking the law into their own hands. On  December , the case was brought before the appropriate court, the defendants were given the opportunity to be heard on  April  and they are currently free citizens.
.Regarding the comportment of the national guard and the police of the State of Bolvar vis--vis a group of citizens who were holding up traffic in the Redoma de la Pia and the Simn Bolvar motorway on  March , the Government states that on  March ,  citizens were charged with causing those incidents before the corresponding court in the State of Bolvar. Judging that the participants in the incidents had not been identified by name, the court ordered that the defendants be released unconditionally and they are currently free citizens.
.Regarding the trade union officials of SUTRA CVG, Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada, and trade unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Loran Azocar and Darwin Lpez, the Government states that the Third Attorney-General s Office of the Second Judicial Circuit of the State of Bolvar brought charges against them for the crimes of unlawful association and restricting freedom of work. A preliminary hearing was held at which the charges were confirmed and a trial was ordered, and the defendants were cited to appear on  May . In accordance with established procedure and by decision of the court, however, the defendants are free pending their hearing on  May .
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee noted the considerable delay that had occurred in negotiations between the SUNET CVG and the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana and expected the collective agreement between the two parties to be signed as soon as possible. It requested the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent it any information on the collective bargaining process, and therefore reiterates its previous recommendation and requests the Government to follow up without delay.
.In its previous examination of the allegations concerning the (temporary) detention and criminal prosecution of SUTRA CVG union leaders Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada and trade unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez, the Committee once again urged the Government to draw to the attention of the judicial authority the need to give due consideration to the fact that the trade unionists in question had been staging a peaceful protest calling for the enforcement of the collective agreement and requested the Government to communicate the judgment handed down on them.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement regarding these union leaders, to the effect that the Third Attorney-General s Office of the Second Judicial Circuit of the State of Bolvar brought charges against them for the crimes of unlawful association and restricting freedom of work. A preliminary hearing was held at which the charges were confirmed and a trial was ordered, and the defendants were cited to appear on  May . However, in accordance with established procedure and by decision of the court, the defendants are free pending their hearing on  May .
.The Committee regrets that the Government s observations provide information only up to  May  and do not indicate whether the judicial authority was informed of the need to take duly into account the fact that the trade unionists concerned had been engaged in a peaceful demonstration to demand compliance with the collective agreement. Under these circumstances, the Committee reiterates the conclusions it reached on these allegations in its previous examination of the case and requests the Government to follow up without delay.
.The Committee takes note that, in its reply, the Government refers to the criminal proceedings brought against union leaders and members of SUTISS Bolvar (Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez) and to the criminal charges brought against workers at Camila CA in  (Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez).
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the defendants, who are currently free citizens, were charged with second-degree misappropriation of funds, restricting the freedom of work and taking the law into their own hands, that the case was brought before the appropriate court in the State of Bolvar on  December  and that a hearing had been set for  April . The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent any information since then on further developments in the case and, that being so, reiterates its previous recommendation, as follows:... with regard to the allegations concerning the criminal prosecution of the SUTISS Bolvar trade union leaders Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez, and the criminal prosecution in  of the employees of the enterprise Camila CA Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez, the Committee requests the Government to communicate without delay the judgment handed down in regard to these trade union leaders and workers and, in view of the fact that the events in question date back to , and that these trade unionists are required to report periodically to the court, expects that the judgment will be handed down in the near future. In this regard, the Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.
.The Committee had requested the Government to supply a copy of the judgment that was handed down with respect to a group of some  steelworkers from Ternium Sidor who, on  March , were calling for improvements to the collective agreement that was being negotiated with their employer and who, according to the Government, were blocking the traffic with cars, burning tyres and throwing heavy objects at members of the national guard unit, injuring several officers. The Committee takes due note of the Government s statement that on  March  the  defendants were charged with provoking these incidents before the appropriate court in the State of Bolvar and were unconditionally discharged, on the grounds that the participants in the incidents had not been identified by name. The defendants are therefore currently free citizens.
.The Committee recalls, however, that in its previous examination of the case it requested the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations concerning the excessive use of public force, which resulted in serious injuries and property damage (according to the allegations, the authorities destroyed  vehicles). The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent it the requested information and reiterates its recommendation on the matter.
.In its previous examination of the alleged detention since September  of union leader Rubn Gonzlez, for demonstrating against the failure of CGV Ferrominera Orinoco CA of Puerto Ordaz to meet its commitments under the collective agreement, and the criminal proceedings brought against him, the Committee noted in June  that, in its earlier examination of the case in November , it had considered that the charges did not justify the union leader s having been placed in preventive detention or under house arrest since September  and had requested the Government to ensure that he was released without delay pending the court s ruling and that he was appropriately compensated for the damages suffered. The Committee took note, in its examination of the case in June , that the Government stated that on  September  the Attorney-General s Office had accused Rubn Gonzlez of committing crimes against public order, including incitement to break the law, unlawful association, restriction of the freedom of work and non-compliance with special security zone regulations, and that the court had confirmed the charges and ordered that he be placed under house arrest. The Committee took note of the Government s statement, regarding the interim measure of house arrest that was imposed on  January , that the relevant court, noting that the measure had not been implemented, had revoked the measure and set a preliminary hearing for  March , at which the defendant was not granted legal assistance. A subsequent hearing was held, which endorsed the charges brought by the Attorney-General s office against Rubn Gonzlez, and his trial is therefore currently under way. The Committee noted that the Government concluded, by stating that the trial began",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
61,"on  November , that the relevant criminal court held hearing No.  on  February , and that the proceedings were to be concluded on Monday,  February, when the judge would hand down a ruling on the matter. In other words, the trial was still in progress.
.The Committee took note of the new allegations of  March  presented by the complainant to the effect that on  February  a judge condemned union leader Rubn Gonzlez to seven years, six months and  days in prison, and that it was therefore something of a surprise when, three days later, the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice overturned the sentence on the grounds that it lacked substance and Rubn Gonzlez was released. The outcome of this development is that the union leader is now awaiting a new sentence, which this time will be handed down by a criminal judge  km from his home (the complainant stresses that he had been previously under house arrest for  months).
.The Committee regretted the delay in the criminal proceedings brought against Rubn Gonzlez and the lack of substance motivating the sentence handed down by the judge originally handling the case and requested the Government to communicate to it the new sentence that is to be handed down. The Committee reiterated its earlier recommendation, considering that the charges against the union leader do not justify the fact that he has been in preventive detention or under house arrest ever since September , and requested that he be appropriately compensated for the damages suffered.
.The Committee takes note that in its latest reply the Government rejects the complainant s allegations of  March  and the accusations they contain and states that it will duly inform the Committee of the outcome of the case.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice examined the case against Rubn Gonzlez that had been brought before the court of first instance and ruled that the sentence handed down by the Sixth Tribunal of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the State of Bolvar lacked sufficient grounds, a procedural error that is in violation of principles and guarantees, such as access to justice and due process, that are embodied in the Constitution and that it had therefore declared the original sentence null and void. The case was transferred to another court of justice to hold a public trial and hand down a new sentence. The same Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice likewise imposed on Rubn Daro Gonzlez Rojas a less severe interim measure than the previous one, by requiring him to present himself before the judicial authority every two weeks and prohibiting him from leaving the country. The Committee takes note of the Government s explanation that the Supreme Court of Justice has the power, at its own discretion or at the request of a party, to take over any file or case and deal with it itself or assign it to another court. Its authority to do so is laid down in article  of the Organic Act establishing the Supreme Court of Justice. In the case of Gonzlez Rojas the courts within whose jurisdiction it would normally fall were relieved of the case on the grounds that it had disturbed the tranquillity and daily life of the State of Bolvar and, in order to maintain the purpose of established criminal proceedings and to ensure that justice was applied responsibly and swiftly, the case was transferred to a different criminal circuit court in the metropolitan area of Caracas.
.However, the Committee notes with regret that the Government has failed to explain the steps required to be taken to sanction the Attorney-General for prosecuting, in the first place, a charge of  unlawful association' which, according to the information available before the Committee in its previous examination of the case, had no substance and has, after a period of unjustified imprisonment of the trade union leader, now been set aside.
.Once again the Committee regrets the delay in the criminal proceedings brought against Rubn Gonzlez (who is currently required under an interim measure to present himself before the judicial authority of Caracas every two weeks and prohibited from leaving the country) and would like to know why it was necessary to remove the case from the criminal court within whose jurisdiction it would normally fall. The Committee expresses its concern at the fact that the interim measure requiring Rubn Gonzlez to travel periodically to Caracas means that he has to travel long distances that disrupt the exercise of his trade union functions and should therefore be avoided.
.The Committee requests the Government to communicate to it the new sentence to be handed down following the revoking by the Supreme Court of Justice of an earlier sentence on the grounds that it was insufficiently motivated. Finally, the Committee reiterates the recommendation it made when it examined the case previously, considering that the charges against Rubn Gonzlez do not justify the preventive detention and house arrest to which he was subjected for seven years prior to the current interim measures and once again requests the Government that he be compensated for the damages suffered.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Bearing in mind the considerable delay in the negotiation process, the Committee expects the collective agreement between SUNEP CVG and the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana to be signed as soon as possible and once again requests the Government to keep it informed of developments without delay.(b)	Regarding the alleged (provisional) arrest and criminal prosecution of SUTRA CVG union officials Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada and of trade unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez, the Committee urges the Government once again to draw the judicial authority s attention without delay to the need for it to take duly into account the fact that the trade unionists concerned were engaged in a peaceful demonstration to demand compliance with the collective agreement, and requests the Government to communicate to it without delay the sentence that is handed down.(c)	Regarding the alleged criminal prosecution of SUTISS Bolvar union leaders (Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez) and the criminal prosecution of employees of Camila CA in  (Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez), the Committee requests the Government to communicate to it without delay the sentence handed down on the said union leaders and employees and, bearing in mind that the incidents date back to  and that the trade unionists involved are required periodically to present themselves before the judicial authority, trusts that the sentence will be handed down very soon. The Committee recalls that a delay in the administration of justice is tantamount to a denial of justice.(d)	Regarding the alleged brutal repression by the national guard and police of the State of Bolvar of a gathering of steelworkers from Ternium Sidor who were demanding improvements to the collective agreement under negotiation, which resulted in injuries to several people, dozens of criminal prosecutions and the destruction by the authorities of  vehicles belonging to the workers (according to the Government, a group of some  workers was blocking the traffic with private vehicles, burning tyres and throwing heavy objects at members of the national guard unit, injuring several officers), the Committee takes note that the judicial authority ordered the unconditional release of the workers who had been charged and again requests the Government to conduct an inquiry without delay into the allegations that the police used excessive force and caused serious injuries and damage to property.(e)	The Committee regrets once again the delay in the criminal proceedings brought against the trade union leader Mr Ruben Gonzlez (which have resulted in repeated restrictions of his free movement) and requests the Government to provide it with a copy of the judgment that is handed down after the initial sentence was declared null and void by the Supreme Court of Justice because it lacked sufficient grounds. Finally, the Committee reiterates the recommendation it made when it first examined the case, considering that the charges against Ruben Gonzlez do not justify his preventive detention or house arrest for years prior to the present interim measures, and requests the Government that he be compensated for the damages suffered.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body].
.The Single National Union of Public Employees of the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana (SUNEP-CVG) sent new allegations in communications dated  and  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
62,"Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the alleged obstacles to the exercise of the right to strike (the complainant organization alleges that, as the Puerto Ordaz labour inspectorate has not followed the legal procedures with regard to the list of demands presented by the SUNEP-CVG more than three years ago calling for the enforcement of the collective agreement and for other rights, it has not been possible to lawfully exercise the right to strike in the CVG), the Committee notes the Government s statement to the effect that the list of demands presented by the SUNEP-CVG is currently being negotiated with the CVG and only four of the  initial bargaining items remain to be discussed. In view of the lengthy delay in the bargaining process, the Committee expects that the collective agreement will be signed as soon as possible and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the (temporary) detention and criminal prosecution of the SUTRA-CVG union leaders Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada and unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez, the Committee had urged the Government, in its previous examination of the case, to urge the judicial authority to give due consideration to the fact that the trade unionists in question were staging a peaceful protest calling for the enforcement of the collective agreement and requested the Government to inform it of the judgment handed down in relation to those trade unionists. The Committee notes that the Government states that the Office of the Public Prosecutor filed charges against those individuals as a result of the events that occurred on  October , on the premises of the preschool establishment of the CVG and that, at the preliminary hearing, a precautionary measure was ordered consisting in prohibiting the disruption or hindrance of work at the enterprise; the trial is now under way, according to the Government, and the oral hearing is scheduled for  March . The Committee reiterates its previous conclusions and requests the Government to inform it of the judgment handed down by the judicial authority.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the criminal prosecution of the SUTISS-Bolvar trade union leaders Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez, and the criminal prosecution in  of the employees of the enterprise Camila CA, Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez, the Committee takes note of the statements by the Government, according to which: () on  September , the Office of the Public Prosecutor received a complaint from the representatives of the enterprise alleging that, on  August , the individuals in question violently and without the authorization or consent of any representative of the enterprise forcefully took possession of six machines and refused to return them, paralysing the industrial activities being carried out in various parts of the enterprise; () on  July , the Office of the Public Prosecutor charged the abovementioned individuals with aggravated misappropriation, restriction of freedom to work and taking the law into their own hands, as provided in the Venezuelan Penal Code; at the preliminary hearing, held on  September , the charges were admitted and a precautionary measure applied consisting of the requirement to report periodically to the court; the persons concerned are thus free, and the order was issued for the case to go to trial. The public oral hearing was scheduled and deferred on several occasions owing to failure of the accused parties to appear; and () the Office of the Public Prosecutor reported that on  January , the accused individuals presented themselves at the trial court and a date is to be fixed by the judicial authority for the oral hearing.
.The Committee urgently requests the Government to communicate the judgment handed down in regard to these trade union leaders and workers and, in view of the fact that the events in question date back to  and that these trade unionists are required to report periodically to the court, expects that the judgment will be handed down in the near future. In this regard, the Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.
.With regard to the allegation that, on  March , the national guard and the Bolvar State Police brutally repressed a gathering of steelworkers from Ternium-Sidor who were calling for improvements to the collective agreement that was being negotiated, resulting in several wounded, dozens of criminal prosecutions and the destruction by the authorities of  vehicles belonging to the workers, the Committee, having noted in its previous examination of the case that, according to the Government, a group of some  workers was blocking traffic with cars and burning tyres and throwing heavy objects at the members of the national guard unit, injuring several officers, requested the Government to supply a copy of the judgment that is handed down, noted the delay in the judicial proceedings and requested the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations concerning the excessive use of public force which resulted in serious injuries and property damage. The Committee notes the Government s reply to the effect that: () it reiterates that the these acts occurred when a group of individuals were obstructing vehicle traffic with cars and burning tyres, throwing heavy objects at the members of the national guard, injuring several officers (Ral Mora, Alexander Marin Bucarelo, Pastran Comentes); () according to the Government, the demonstrators threw stones, bottles and iron briquettes, resulting in action by the national guard and the state police, and the detention of several persons for these acts of violence and the alleged obstruction and closure of thoroughfares; the court ordered the initiation of ordinary proceedings without imposing any custodial measures. The Committee reiterates its conclusions in the previous examination of the case.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the detention since September  and criminal prosecution of union leader Rubn Gonzlez, for protesting against the failure by the enterprise CGV Ferrominera Orinoco CA (Puerto Ordaz) to honour the commitments set out in the collective agreement, the Committee considered in its previous examination of the case, that the events, as alleged by the Government, do not justify his preliminary detention or house arrest since September  and requested that he be released without delay pending judgment and appropriately compensated for the damages suffered. The Committee notes that the Government reiterates that on  September , the Office of the Public Prosecutor charged that individual with public order offences such as incitement to commit an offence, illegal assembly, restriction of freedom to work, and breach of the special security zone arrangements, and that the court received the charges and ordered the house arrest of the accused. The Committee notes that the Government states that, as regards the precautionary measure (house arrest) imposed on  January , the competent court issued a finding of non-compliance, and therefore revoked it, setting  March  as the date of the preliminary hearing, which the defence counsel for the accused failed to attend. The hearing was subsequently held in the court of preliminary proceedings (Tribunal de Control), which admitted the charges brought by the Office of the Public Prosecutor against Mr Rubn Gonzlez, and consequently the case is currently under trial. The Committee notes that the Government concludes by stating that the trial began on  November ; on  February , hearing No.  was held in the competent criminal court; the closing session of the trial is scheduled for Monday  February, when a ruling may be handed down by the judge in this case, and that the trial is thus in full progress.
.The Committee takes note of the new allegations of the complainant organization to the effect that on  February , trade union leader Rubn Gonzlez was sentenced by a criminal court judge to a prison term of seven years, six months and  days, although he was unexpectedly released on parole three days after being sentenced, the judgment having been overturned by decision of the criminal division of the Supreme Court of Justice on the grounds that it was unfounded; the trade union leader is thus awaiting a new judgment, which will be handed down by a criminal court judge  kilometres from his place of residence (the complainant organization points out that he was deprived of freedom for  months).
.The Committee regrets the delay in the criminal proceedings relating to the trade union leader Rubn Gonzlez and the lack of adequate grounds for the judgment handed down by the judge in the case, and requests the Government to inform it of the new criminal judgment to be handed down. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation, considering that the events, as alleged by the Government, do not justify his preliminary detention or house arrest since September , and requests that he be appropriately compensated for the damages suffered.
.In",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
63,"the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) In view of the lengthy delay in the bargaining process, the Committee expects that the collective agreement between the SUNEPCVG and the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) will be signed as soon as possible and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the (temporary) detention and criminal prosecution of the SUTRA-CVG union leaders Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada and unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez, the Committee again urges the Government to draw to the attention of the judicial authority the need to give due consideration to the fact that the trade unionists in question were staging a peaceful protest calling for the enforcement of the collective agreement and requests the Government to communicate the judgment handed down in relation to these trade unionists.(c) With regard to the allegations concerning the criminal prosecution of the SUTISS-Bolvar trade union leaders Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez, and the criminal prosecution in  of the employees of the enterprise Camila CA Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez, the Committee requests the Government to communicate without delay the judgment handed down in regard to these trade union leaders and workers and, in view of the fact that the events in question date back to , and that these trade unionists are required to report periodically to the court, expects that the judgment will be handed down in the near future. In this regard, the Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.(d) With regard to the allegation that, on  March , the national guard and the Bolvar State Police brutally repressed a gathering of steelworkers from Ternium-Sidor who were calling for improvements to the collective agreement that was being negotiated, resulting in several wounded, dozens of criminal prosecutions and the destruction by the authorities of  vehicles belonging to the workers, the Committee, noting once again that, according to the Government, a group of some  workers was blocking the traffic with cars and burning tyres and throwing heavy objects at the members of the national guard unit, injuring several officers, once again requests the Government to supply a copy of the judgment that is handed down, notes the delay in the judicial proceedings and requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations concerning the excessive use of public force which resulted in serious injuries and property damage.(e) The Committee regrets the delay in the criminal proceedings relating to the trade union leader Rubn Gonzlez (currently on parole) and the lack of adequate grounds for the judgment handed down by the judge in the case, and requests the Government to inform it of the new criminal judgment to be handed down. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation, considering that the charges against this leader do not justify his preliminary detention or house arrest since September , and requests that he be appropriately compensated for the damages suffered.
.The complaint is contained in communications dated  November  and  February  presented by the Single National Union of Public Employees of the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana (SUNEP-CVG).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organization s allegations concern obstacles to exercising the right to strike and the arrest and/or prosecution of trade union leaders and members, who are often required to report to the authorities on a monthly basis, for exercising trade union activities.
.Regarding the alleged obstacles to the exercise of the right to strike, the complainant organization alleges that, as the administrative authority (Puerto Ordaz labour inspectorate) has not followed the legal procedures with regard to the list of demands presented by SUNEP-CVG more than three years ago calling for the enforcement of the collective agreement and for other rights, it has not been possible to lawfully exercise the right to strike in the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana (CVG).
.The Committee notes that the Government has not sent observations with regard to this allegation and therefore the Committee requests it to address without delay the list of demands by SUNEP-CVG so that the union can bargain collectively with the enterprise and perhaps lawfully exercise the right to strike.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the arrest and criminal prosecution of the SUTRA-CVG union leaders Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada and unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez for staging a peaceful protest against the withholding of the benefits under the collective agreement, the Committee takes note of the statements by the Government, according to which: () these individuals were arrested in October  for padlocking and chaining closed the doors of the premises of the CVG s nursery, preventing the staff from entering freely and leaving the workers' children out on the street; () they were released; () they were charged with the offences of illegal assembly, violation of freedom of movement and incitement to commit an offence and of engaging in crimes against the security and rights of the population.
.The Committee expresses its surprise at the fact that trade unionists have been charged with various offences for closing ' as stated by the Government ' the premises of a preschool establishment. The Committee urges the Government to urge the judicial authority to give due consideration to the fact that the trade unionists in question were staging a peaceful protest calling for the enforcement of the collective agreement and requests the Government to inform it of the judgement handed down in relation to these trade unionists.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the criminal prosecution of the Sutiss-Bolvar trade union leaders Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez, the Committee notes that the Government has not supplied observations in this respect and requests it to send them without delay.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the criminal prosecution in  of the employees of the enterprise Camila CA, Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez, for protesting against the poor working conditions imposed on workers, the Committee takes note of the statements by the Government, according to which these workers: () forcefully took six payloader machines from one plant (Planta de Cal) to another (Planta de Peas), refusing to return them, and causing the cessation of the industrial activities being conducted in various areas of the enterprise; () were charged with the offences of misappropriation, restricting freedom to work, taking the law into their own hands and breaching the special security zone arrangements under the Organic National Security Act; () the oral hearing is scheduled for  September . The Committee notes the discrepancies between the version given by the complainant organization and that given by the Government and requests the Government to supply a copy of the judgement that is handed down. The Committee notes that the complaint dates back to  and it can only regret the delay in the court proceedings. Lastly, the Committee considers that section  of the Organic National Security Act, which provides that activities to disrupt or adversely affect the organization and operation of public services, industries and core enterprises, or the social and economic life of the country, carry a penalty of five to ten years' imprisonment, may apply to the lawful exercise of the right to strike in activities that are not essential in the strict sense of the term and therefore it should be amended. The Committee draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.With regard to the allegation that, on  March , the national guard and the Bolvar State Police brutally repressed a gathering of steelworkers from Ternium-Sidor who were calling for improvements to the collective agreement that was being negotiated, resulting in several wounded, dozens of criminal prosecutions and the destruction by the authorities of  vehicles belonging to the workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () a group of some  workers was blocking the traffic with cars and burning tyres and throwing heavy objects at the members of the national guard unit, injuring several officers; ()  workers were arrested and the next day these individuals were brought before the judicial authority charged with the obstruction and severance of channels of communication; and () the Office of the Public Prosecutor is conducting inquiries and investigations. The Committee notes the delay in the criminal proceedings, as the allegations date back to",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
64,"March  and requests the Government to supply a copy of the judgement that is handed down. It also requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations concerning the excessive use of public force which resulted in serious injuries and property damage.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the detention and criminal prosecution of union leader Rubn Gonzlez, who works for the enterprise CGV Ferrominera Orinoco CA (Puerto Ordaz), for protesting against the failure to honour the commitments set out in the collective agreement, the Committee takes note that, according to the Government:
.More generally, with regard to the allegation concerning the criminalization of trade union protests and public demonstrations, the Committee notes that the Government rejects this allegation and asserts that the rights to demonstrate and to strike are guaranteed provided that no irreparable damage is caused to the population or to institutions. The Committee notes that this case concerns the arrest and criminal prosecution of a considerable number of trade unionists, who, for example, for stopping production or undermining freedom to work have had three or more criminal charges laid against them and sometimes precautionary measures requiring them to report to the authorities on a monthly basis; the aim of these measures is not understood and they may have a detrimental effect and be a deterring factor in the exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee expresses its concern regarding the multiple charges laid against these unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee notes that although there may have been ' if the statements by the Government are corroborated ' some excesses, all penalties should be proportionate to the fault committed.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government has not denied the allegations concerning the breach of collective agreements in several enterprises (which, according to the Government, have been nationalized) and the difficulties faced with regard to bargaining collectively and exercising the right to strike in the steel sector and requests the Government to take measures to ensure that these rights are respected in practice and that effective dispute settlement mechanisms are put in place.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Regarding the alleged obstacles to the exercise of the right to strike (the complainant organization alleges that as the Puerto Ordaz labour inspectorate has not followed the legal procedure with regard to the list of demands presented by SUNEP-CVG more than three years ago calling for the enforcement of the collective agreement and for other rights, it has not been possible to lawfully exercise the right to strike in the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana (CVG)), the Committee notes that the Government has not supplied observations with regard to this allegation and therefore the Committee requests it to address, without delay, the list of demands by SUNEP-CVG so that the union can bargain collectively with the enterprise and perhaps lawfully exercise the right to strike.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the (temporary) detention and criminal prosecution of the SUTRA-CVG union leaders, Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada and the unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez, the Committee urges the Government to urge the judicial authority to give due consideration to the fact that the trade unionists in question were staging a peaceful protest calling for the enforcement of the collective agreement and requests the Government to inform it of the judgement handed down in relation to these trade unionists.(c) With regard to the allegation concerning the criminal prosecution of the Sutiss-Bolvar trade union leaders, Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez, the Committee notes that the Government has not supplied observations in this respect and requests it to send them without delay.(d) With regard to the allegation concerning the criminal prosecution in  of the employees of the enterprise Camila CA, Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez, the Committee requests the Government to supply a copy of the judgement that is handed down and notes that as the complaint dates back to  it can only regret the delay in the court proceedings.(e) The Committee considers that section  of the Organic National Security Act, which provides that activities to disrupt or adversely affect the organization and operation of public services, industries and core enterprises, or the social and economic life of the country, carry a penalty of five to ten years' imprisonment, may apply to the lawful exercise of the right to strike in activities that are not essential in the strict sense of the term and therefore it should be amended. The Committee draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.(f) With regard to the allegation that, on  March , the national guard and the Bolvar State Police brutally repressed a gathering of steelworkers from Ternium-Sidor who were calling for improvements to the collective agreement that was being negotiated, resulting in several wounded, dozens of criminal prosecutions and the destruction by the authorities of  vehicles belonging to the workers, the Committee, while noting that, according to the Government, a group of some  workers was blocking the traffic with cars and burning tyres and throwing heavy objects at the members of the national guard unit, injuring several officers, and requests the Government to supply a copy of the judgement that is handed down, notes the delay in the legal proceedings and requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations concerning the excessive use of public force which resulted in serious injuries and property damage.(g) With regard to the alleged detention since September  and criminal prosecution of trade union leader Rubn Gonzlez for protesting against the failure by CGV Ferrominera Orinoco CA (Puerto Ordaz) to honour the commitments set out in the collective agreement, the Committee considers that the events as alleged by the Government against the union leader do not justify his preliminary detention or house arrest since September  and requests that he be released without delay pending judgement and appropriately compensated for his inappropriate detention. The Committee requests the Government to supply a copy of the judgement that is handed down.(h) More generally, with regard to the allegation concerning the criminalization of trade union protests and public demonstrations, the Committee notes that although the Government rejects this allegation it must be noted that this case concerns the arrest and criminal prosecution of a considerable number of trade unionists, who, for example, for stopping production or undermining freedom to work have had three or more criminal charges laid against them and sometimes precautionary measures requiring them to report to the authorities on a monthly basis; the aim of these measures is not understood and they may have a detrimental effect and be a deterring factor in the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee expresses its concern regarding the multiple charges laid against these unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee notes that although there may have been ' if the statements by the Government are corroborated ' some excesses, all penalties should be proportionate to the fault committed.(i) Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government has not denied the allegations concerning the breach of collective agreements in several enterprises (which, according to the Government, have been nationalized) and the difficulties faced with regard to bargaining collectively and exercising the right to strike in the steel sector and requests the Government to take measures to ensure that these rights are respected in practice and that effective dispute settlement mechanisms are put in place.",1,2010,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
65,".At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending concerning the Single Organized National Trade Union of Workers of the Judiciary (SUONTRAJ) [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not provided the information requested on report No.  and therefore once again requests the Government to explain for what purpose report No.  of  July  was drawn up identifying persons attending the meeting organized by the complainant organization, which according to the latter was possibly intended to enable action to be taken that would be prejudicial for the participants.
.In its communication of  October , the Government explained in relation to the preparation of report No. , dated  July , to which the Committee refers that: at . a.m. on Tuesday,  July , the members of the SUONTRAJ called on the court workers to hold an extraordinary general assembly in the vicinity of the seat of the municipal courts during working hours, of which neither the Executive Directorate of the Magistracy, nor the judicial coordination department was aware, however, some workers responded to the invitation and grouped at the main entrance to the building. The officials' participation in this activity meant that they were unexpectedly absent from the job, which affected the normal operation of work within the institution responsible for the administration of justice. This was neither the fault of the judges nor the will of the state institutions, but was a sudden, unplanned situation which was unexpected by the judicial authorities, and hence it was necessary to make a record of the event as a new situation which disrupted citizens' timely access to justice. This was the sole purpose, as is evident in one of the paragraphs, which is quoted from the report:  It is noted that at around . a.m. this morning a group of officials of the Judicial Circuit assembled on the ground floor of the courthouse building in response to the invitation from the Steering Committee of the East Caracas branch of SUONTRAJ ' However, the Municipal Courts with their seat in the building agreed to perform [the work], even though the document reception and distribution unit and the records management department, which are very important support services in the work of the courts, did not have all their full complement of staff.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Government adds that highly sensitive areas of the court s activity were obviously disrupted as a result, but that there is no evidence in the full report of any intimidation by the judicial authority, still less of threats or coercion, of the officials identified in the report or of the complainant trade union organization.
.The Committee notes the Government s explanations concerning the preparation of the report.
.At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on issues that had remained pending concerning the Single Organized National Trade Union of Workers of the Judiciary (SUONTRAJ) [see the th Report, para. ]:' The Committee invites the complainant organization to supply additional information with respect: () to its allegations concerning the systematic outsourcing of work in the Judiciary, disguised labour relations and recruitment on a fee basis in violation of the collective agreement; and () its allegations relating to the restriction of the right of trade union members to take time off to carry out trade union activities.' The Committee requests the Government to explain for what purpose report No.  of  July  was drawn up identifying persons attending the meeting organized by the complainant organization, which according to the latter was possibly intended to enable action to be taken that would be prejudicial for the participants.' The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to have the nine union officials cited in the complaint reinstated in their jobs and to respect the principles referred to in the conclusions with regard to anti-union discrimination and the restructuring process.
.In its communication of  February , referring to the dismissal of the nine trade union officials, the Government states that the authorities have handed down rulings in favour of Mr Marcano and Mr Freites, ordering their reinstatement at work and payment of wage arrears. The Government adds that the other workers mentioned in the complaint have not filed any complaints with the Labour Inspectorate.
.The Committee notes the Government s information concerning the dismissed trade union officials and notes with interest the reinstatement at work of two of them. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not provided the information requested on report No.  and therefore once again requests the Government to explain for what purpose report No.  of  July  was drawn up identifying persons attending the meeting organized by the complainant organization, which according to the latter was possibly intended to enable action to be taken that would be prejudicial for the participants.
.Finally the Committee notes with regret that the complainant organization SUONTRAJ has not submitted the information that it had requested at its June  meeting. The Committee informs SUONTRAJ that if it does not receive the requested information before its next meeting, it will not pursue the examination of these allegations.
.The complaint was lodged in a communication of November  from the Single Organized National Trade Union of Workers of the Judiciary (SUONTRAJ). Public Services International (PSI) supported the complaint in a communication dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization alleges: () that the Executive Directorate of the Magistracy of the Supreme Court of Justice is systematically implementing a policy aimed at outsourcing work in violation of freedom of association and the right to bargain collectively, based on principles of capitalist neo-liberalism, by recruiting staff under conditions that are inferior to those stipulated in the collective agreement and legislation in force and by entering into commercial contracts on a fee basis that constitute a labour relationship but without the rights provided for in the Basic Labour Act and in the collective agreement; () union officials have been refused the paid leave provided for in the collective agreement; () nine union leaders have been dismissed or been the object of disciplinary proceedings in violation of their trade union immunity; () a circular was issued on  July , requiring prior authorization for workers' meetings and prohibiting them during working hours, along with a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice banning the holding of such meetings between . a.m. and  p.m.; () a union meeting on  June  was monitored by the coordinating magistrate of the judicial circuit of the courts of the municipality of Caracas who drew up an official report identifying the participants; () the Supreme Court of Justice adopted a decision stating that the process of restructuring must not respect the stability of employment of union officials, passed a resolution on  March , dismissing the nine officials referred to above in violation of their trade union immunity and, by virtue of the restructuring order, called for an assessment of all the workers; () the National Electoral Council has hampered the holding of SUONTRAJ s union elections and for over two years the Executive Directorate of the Magistracy of the Supreme Court of Justice has refused to hold collective negotiations.
.According to the complainant organization the anti-union practices began following the lodging of a complaint against the Executive Directorate of the Magistracy of the Supreme Court of Justice alleging administrative corruption. The Committee notes the Government s general statement that at no moment did the Executive Directorate of the Magistracy engage in anti-union practices and that it will abide by whatever decision is handed down in the procedure that has been initiated following the lodging of the complaint.
.Regarding the alleged failure to comply with the provisions of the collective agreement by outsourcing work, by entering into commercial contracts on a fee basis and by disguising labour relationships, the Committee notes that the Government denies the allegations and states that contracts on a fee basis are the exception and do not concern a significant number of employees of the Judiciary as they are determined by the specific nature of the activity concerned ' such as that of external advisors whose duties differ from those of regular employees in terms of hours of work, etc. The Committee notes that the Government requests it to seek additional information from the complainant on these allegations. The Committee invites the complainant organization to supply that information.
.With regard to the circular of  July , which it is alleged restricts the rights of trade unions by requiring that they seek prior authorization for workers' meetings and that such meetings be held outside working hours, and to the monitoring of one such meeting",-1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
66,"and the drawing up by the coordinating magistrate of the judicial circuit of a report listing the names of participants, the Committee notes the Government s reminder that Convention No.  does not deal with the position public servants engaged in the administration of the State (Article  of Convention No. ), that Article  of Convention No.  refers specifically to  union activities outside working hours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours'  that the Venezuelan people s right of access to justice is embodied in the Constitution, that justice is an essential service and that the various trade union organizations also hold meetings that cause delays in the work of the employees. The Committee also notes the Government s statement that public installations are made available for the holding of meetings outside working hours and that no meetings have been prevented from taking place outside hours of work. The Committee notes further the Government s denial that the coordinating magistrate of the judicial circuit of the courts of the municipality of Caracas monitored the meeting of the complainant organization held on  July  or that the coordinating magistrate attended the meeting. The Committee requests the Government to explain for what purpose report No.  of  July  was drawn up identifying persons attending the said meeting. The Government invites the complainant organization to send additional information if it so wishes.
.Regarding the alleged systematic refusal to grant trade unionists paid leave for carrying out union activities as provided for in the legislation and in the collective agreement, the Committee notes the Government s statement that, in application of the rules in force, up to  hours of union leave have been granted under the collective agreement and other optional arrangements and that all the Executive Directorate of the Magistracy has done has been to verify that the motives were justified and that the leave was for a specific period of time, as stipulated in the collective agreement. The Committee also notes the Government s observation that the applicable rules do not allow false or futile motives or the submission of forged or falsified documents. The Committee notes further the Government s suggestion that the complainant organization provides information on specific instances. The Committee invites the complainant organization to send additional information if it so wishes.
.Regarding the alleged link between the restrictions on the holding of SUONTRAJ s electoral elections and interference by the National Electoral Council, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the National Electoral Council had found that the bonds posted by the nominees were insufficient when SUONTRAJ requested authorization to hold elections (the executive board s mandate ended in ) and that the legislation in force requires that in such circumstances the members of the executive board cannot represent the union s members in collective bargaining.
.The Committee wishes to place on record that for years it has periodically received complaints from trade union organizations alleging interference by the National Electoral Council in elections to their executive boards. The Committee has had cause to remind the Government that Article  of Convention No.  establishes the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom without interference by the authorities and that ' beyond the provision of mere voluntary technical assistance ' any intervention by the National Electoral Council before, during or after the elections constitutes an infringement of Convention No. , especially considering that it is not a judicial body.
.The Committee emphasizes, moreover, that interference by this body has repeatedly come in for severe criticism by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and by the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards. In its  report, for example, the Committee of Experts, considering that the National Electoral Council s interference in trade union elections constituted a serious violation of freedom of association, recalled that it had raised the following point:The need for the National Electoral Council (CNE), which is not a judicial body, to cease interfering in trade union elections and to no longer be empowered to annul them, and the need for the statute for the election of the executive bodies of national (trade union) organizations, which accords a preponderant role to the CNE in the various stages of such elections, to be amended or repealed.
.The Committee of Experts noted that the Conference Committee, after hearing the Government representative indicate that, in May , a new process of public consultations had been initiated on the draft text of the Basic Labour Act, had adopted the following conclusion:Under these circumstances, the Committee regrets that for over nine years the Bill to reform the Basic Labour Act has still not been adopted by the National Assembly despite the fact that it had tripartite consensus support. Taking into account the significance of the restrictions which remain in the legislation with regard to freedom of association and the freedom to organize, the Committee once again urges the Government to take measures to accelerate the examination by the Legislative Assembly of the Bill to reform the Basic Labour Act and to ensure that the CNE ceases to interfere in trade union elections. The Committee emphasizes the need to reform the standards adopted in  respecting trade union elections and recalls that the Committee on Freedom of Association has repeatedly found cases of interference by the CNE that are incompatible with the Convention.
.Consequently, as it has done on similar occasions, the Committee urges the Government to prevent any interference of the National Electoral Council in elections to the executive board of the complainant trade union and that it take measures to amend or repeal the legal provisions that allow the interference of the National Electoral Council in trade union elections. The Committee urges the Government to take appropriate measures in this respect, to respect the elections of the complainant organization and to refrain from invoking supposed irregularities or appeals in order to prevent the conduct of collective bargaining. The Committee also urges the Government to take steps to amend the legislation so as to avoid this kind of interference.
.Regarding the allegations concerning the restructuring and the dismissal of nine union officials, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the authorities have ordered the complete restructuring of the Judiciary to combat corruption and impunity and thus to provide a better judicial service; () the process of restructuring is not a disciplinary sanction but an administrative and organizational measure provided for in the rules and regulations governing the Judiciary. The Committee notes the Government s observation that several workers petitioned the labour inspectorates to be reinstated and paid all salaries due and that in some cases the petitions have been upheld and the workers concerned reinstated in their jobs and paid their salaries due, while in other cases no final decision has yet been reached.
.The Committee observes that the restructuring appears to have been ordered without any consultation of the organizations of workers of the Judiciary and to have entailed an evaluation of the entire staff. The Committee regrets that that the Government does not indicate which workers were duly reinstated in their jobs and whether the dismissed union officials were among their number. The Committee notes that the nine union officials belonged to two major trade union organizations (SUONTRAJ and SUNEP) and, in the absence of any clarification or justification for each case by the Government, it can only conclude that they were dismissed because they were union officials and because of their activities in that capacity, in violation of the trade union immunity provided for in the collective agreement and in the Basic Labour Act. The Committee notes the allegation that, in one of its rulings, the Second Administrative Disputes Court of Caracas declared that trade union immunity does not have to be respected in the case of restructuring. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to have the nine dismissed union officials reinstated in their jobs. The Committee also draws the Government s attention to the principle that no person shall be prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present, and to the fact that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to",0,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
67,"elect their representatives in full freedom [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ].
.Since in the present case the dismissals occurred during a process of restructuring, the Committee emphasizes that it is important that governments consult with trade union organizations to discuss the consequences of restructuring programmes on the employment and working conditions of employees [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.The Committee also recalls that in cases of staff reductions it has drawn attention to the principle contained in the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), which mentions among the measures to be taken to ensure effective protection to these workers that recognition of a priority should be given to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce (article .(f)) and that, in one case, where the Government ascribed the dismissal of nine union officials to programmes of restructuring of the State, the Committee emphasized the advisability of giving priority to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce, to ensure their effective protection [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee invites the complainant organization to supply additional information with respect: () to its allegations concerning the systematic outsourcing of work in the Judiciary, disguised labour relations and recruitment on a fee basis in violation of the collective agreement; and () its allegations relating to the restriction of the right of trade union members to take time off to carry out trade union activities.(b) The Committee requests the Government to explain for what purpose report No.  of  July  was drawn up identifying persons attending the meeting organized by the complainant organization, which according to the latter was possibly intended to enable action to be taken that would be prejudicial for the participants.(c) The Committee urges the Government to prevent any interference of the National Electoral Council in elections to the executive board of the complainant trade union and that it refrain from invoking supposed irregularities or appeals in order to prevent the holding of collective negotiations, as in previous cases.(d) The Committee urges the Government to take measures to amend or repeal the legal provisions that allow interference by the National Electoral Council in trade union elections.(e) The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to have the nine union officials cited in the complaint reinstated in their jobs and to respect the principles referred to in the conclusions with regard to antiunion discrimination and the restructuring process.",1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
68,".In its previous examination of the case, in June , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, General Secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, Organizational Secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, Culture and Sports Secretary) the Committee urges the Government to expedite investigations in order to identify and punish the instigators or accomplices of the murders of these officials whose perpetrator according to investigations died while committing a common crime.(b)	With regard to the murder of the two trade union delegates, Mr Felipe Alejandro Matas Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran, the Committee regrets that in its response the Government did not provide information on developments in the judicial proceedings and investigations concerning the aggravated homicide of the two abovementioned trade union delegates and whether the two accused have been arrested, and once again firmly expects that the judicial authorities will hand down sentences on the perpetrators, should they be found guilty, and where possible on the instigators and accomplices. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(c)	As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney-General s preparation of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at PDVSA because, during a protest in defence of their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities, the Committee urges the Government and the competent authorities to take the necessary measures to have the criminal proceedings brought against the six union officials at PDVSA dropped and to ensure their release without delay. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term and so that in no event may criminal sanctions be imposed in cases of peaceful strikes. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d)	The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts to the legal aspects of this case.(e)	The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of the matters dealt with in this case.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez), the Government states in its communication of  October  that in order to respond once again to this allegation it asked the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic for information, and was told that the Public Prosecutor had ordered a series of useful, necessary and pertinent measures, which had proved the criminal responsibility of Mr Pedro Guillermo Rondn; however, the fact is that on  September , there was a confrontation between this individual and officials belonging to the Anti-extortion and Abduction Group of the National Guard (GAES) and the Investigative and Criminal Police Corps (CICPC), which resulted in the death of the abovementioned accused, Mr Pedro Guillermo Rondn, who was the only person charged in the death of Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez. Consequently, the Public Prosecutor requested that the case be closed, and this request was granted on  October , in accordance with the provisions of section () of the Code of Criminal Procedure and pursuant to section () of this Code. For these reasons, and given that the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic conducted the corresponding investigations, charged the person responsible for the crime in question and that he subsequently lost his life, the Government informs the Committee that it has no further information to provide regarding this matter, in view of the fact that the only person charged died. The Committee is explicitly requested not to comment further on the matter, as the competent institutions and authorities have conducted the corresponding investigations and work and have acted diligently to clarify the facts, the case has been closed by the Public Prosecutor and the Government has fully complied with the obligation to inform and provide all information to the Committee.
.With regard to the murder of Mr Felipe Alejandro Matas Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran, the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic stated that interviews, technical inspections, expert investigations and other steps taken by the Public Prosecutor to date have been unable to identify anyone as the perpetrator or perpetrators of the acts. Nevertheless, the Public Prosecutor is proceeding with the investigations in order to fully clarify the facts.
.As regards the allegations concerning the filing of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at Petrleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) by the Office of the Attorney-General, the Government states that the Office of the Attorney-General said in respect of the case involving six workers from PDVSA GAS (Mr Larrys Antonio Pedrosa, Mr Jos Antonio Tovar, Mr Juan Ramn Aparicio Martnez, Mr Jaffet Enrique Castillo Surez, Mr Roy Rogelio Chaparro Hernndez and Mr Jos Luis Hernndez Alvarado) charged with the offence of boycotting, provided for and punishable under section  of the decree with rank, value and force of law for the defence of persons in accessing goods and services, that the Second Court acting as the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the State of Miranda on  June  deferred the initiation of proceedings. With regard to this case, the Government once again categorically rejects the Committee on Freedom of Association overstepping its powers, resulting in it issuing judgments without any justification and requiring unlawful subjective actions of the Government and its institutions. The Government states that the Committee on Freedom of Association does not have the authority to request it or to urge any government and its competent authorities, to bring to a standstill or to consider terminated any judicial proceedings or to drop criminal proceedings against individuals who commit offences set out in national laws and regulations. The Government emphatically calls on the Committee to refrain from issuing pronouncements of this kind against the decisions handed down by the competent authorities and institutions of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, to stick strictly to its sphere of competence and to refrain from issuing subjective and irresponsible judgments which, moreover, call on the Government to act in violation of its own internal regulations.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements. Underlining that it had classified this case as serious and urgent, the Committee wishes to recall that the murder of union leaders and trade unionists constitutes the most serious violation of freedom of association and that the Committee s procedures were established specifically in order to ensure respect for trade union rights and in particular the right to life of union leaders and trade unionists. Taking this into account, the Committee is surprised, particularly in view of the fact that the allegations date back to , that the Government is reproaching the diligence it is showing in seeking to establish ' beyond the death of the perpetrator ' if there were any instigators or accomplices involved in the murders of trade union officials Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez. The Committee stresses the importance, in cases involving the murder of trade unionists, of identifying the perpetrator, and also any instigators and accomplices.
.With regard to the murder of trade union delegates Mr Felipe Alejandro Matas Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran, the Committee notes that according to the Government s statements the measures taken by the Public Prosecutor have so far been unable to identify anyone as the perpetrator or perpetrators of the acts. The Committee notes the Government s statement that the Public Prosecutor is proceeding with the investigations in order to fully clarify the facts. The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed, the investigations undertaken have not led to the identification of the perpetrator or perpetrators and, if applicable, the instigators and accomplices, and firmly expects that, in the near future, the Government will be in a position to provide information on the identification and detection of those responsible for the murders.
.Finally, with regard to the filing of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at PDVSA by the Office of the Attorney-General because, during a protest in defence of their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities, the Committee wishes to point out to the Government that the in-depth examination of the allegations of the filing of criminal charges against and detention of trade unionists for paralysing the work of an enterprise in a peaceful manner does not exceed its mandate and that in fact it regularly examines allegations of this sort in many countries. The Committee wishes to recall that simply citing a generic type",-1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
69,"of offence, such as the offence of boycotting, without indicating the specific actions the trade unionists are being charged with, does not in itself constitute sufficient grounds to dismiss an allegation of disciplinary action for the peaceful exercise of union protest action, particularly if, as in the present case, the judicial process lasts for several years and the parties concerned remain in custody. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation and requests the Government to indicate the specific actions that the six workers are being charged with, and whether they are still in custody or have been released. As to the recommendation concerning the amendment of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services, the Committee wishes to state that it was made in order to clarify and ensure that the Act does not apply to services that are not essential in the strict sense of the term and that in no event criminal sanctions are imposed in cases of peaceful strikes.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in June , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in June , the Committee made the following recommendations concerning the outstanding issues [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee expresses its grave concern about the serious allegations of murders of workers and union officials, which it deeply regrets.(b)	With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, General Secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, Organizational Secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, Culture and Sports Secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran), the Committee firmly trusts that judicial sentences will be handed down on the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices in the near future. The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c)	As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney General s preparation of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at PDVSA because, during a protest in defence of their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities, the Committee requests the Government or competent authorities to take the necessary measures to have the criminal proceedings brought against the six union officials at PDVSA dropped and to ensure their release without delay. The Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term and so that in no event may criminal sanctions be imposed in cases of peaceful strikes. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. It once again draws the attention of the Committee of Experts to the legislative aspect of this case.(d)	The Committee regrets that for the third consecutive time the complainant organization has failed to send the additional information requested in its earlier conclusions and recommendations and informs it that, if it fails to do so before the next consideration of the case, the Committee will not be in a position to pursue its examination of the allegations. The Committee reproduces its earlier recommendations below:' Concerning the allegations in relation to the contract killings of more than  workers and union officials in the construction sector, the Committee requests the trade union to provide the Government, without delay, with a list of these murders and the circumstances thereof so that the Government can undertake the appropriate investigations without delay.' With respect to the allegations concerning the criminalization of protests, the initiation of judicial proceedings at various enterprises in the oil, gas and steel sectors, and the dismissal of union officials as a result of these protests (according to the CTV, judicial proceedings were started against  workers at the state holding PDVSA,  workers at the  Alfredo Maneiro' Orinoco steelworks for staging a protest in defence of their labour rights and  trade union delegates of the  El Palito' refinery were dismissed after  workers decided to stop work as a result of failure to abide by commitments under the collective agreement; according to the CTV, workers at the enterprises Gas PetroPiar and Gas Comunal have also been affected), the Committee again requests the complainant organization to send the text of the accusations allegedly made against the union members in question.' With regard to the criminal court proceedings against  workers for claiming their rights, the Committee again requests the complainant organization to supply additional information concerning these allegations, specifically, the names of those involved and the activities they are alleged to have undertaken, so that the Government can send its observations in this regard.' The Committee again invites the complainant organization to indicate whether the collective bargaining rights of its affiliates have been respected in the bargaining processes mentioned by the Government.(e)	The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of the matters dealt with in this case.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states once again that it disagrees with the designation of Case No.  as extremely serious and urgent given the continued lack of information from the complainant organization despite repeated requests to which the Committee has received no reply. In this respect, the Government requests that the information be provided by the complainant organization and that it complies with the provisions of Report No. , paragraph (d) in which the Committee, having requested information from the complainants on three consecutive occasions without receiving any reply, informed them that if it did not receive the information before the next consideration of the case, i.e. the meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association on '  November , the Committee would not pursue its examination of the allegations; in the light of the complainant organization s failure to provide the required information, the Government therefore expressly requests the Committee on Freedom of Association to reach a decision on the matter, end its examination of the abovementioned allegations and close this case. The Government indicates that it is making this request to ensure that the Committee s considerations are uniform, coherent and transparent in all the pending cases it is examining against the Government. The Government draws the Committee s attention to cases and allegations that do not receive the due examination necessary for their objective and impartial assessment and are rejected and closed; the Committee should not receive vague and imprecise accusations that far from providing solutions to disputes between parties and being in line with the Committee s purpose, cause delays in judicial proceedings and produce unfounded rulings against the Government.
.As regards the point in which  The Committee expresses its grave concern about the serious allegations of murders of workers and union officials, which it deeply regrets'  the Government has expressed on several occasions its regret regarding the death of workers, trade union leaders and any other national. The Government and the competent institutions and bodies have acted diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases and have fully complied with the obligation to inform the Committee on developments in these cases and to provide details of investigations being carried out by the Office of the Attorney-General, demonstrating their unswerving commitment to providing the supervisory body of the ILO with all the information it has requested.
.With regard to the events concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez), the Government indicates that according to the Office of the Attorney-General, on  October , the Third Court of First Instance, acting as overseeing court for the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the state of Anzotegui, in El Tigre, ruled that the case be closed in accordance with section (), and pursuant to section (), of the Code of Criminal Procedure. There is no ongoing investigation or open file on these events since, taking into account the information in the previous reply, the case was closed when judicial proceedings were dropped following the death of the accused.
.As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney-General s preparation of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at Petrleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) because, during a protest they paralysed the enterprise s activities, the Government once again respectfully draws the Committee s",-1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
70,"attention to the requests made and expressly requests that the information provided be assessed with total objectivity. The Government cannot address the Committee s request to drop  without effect' measures and judicial proceedings which are in strict compliance with the relevant domestic legislation as well as due process and other principles. The Government adds that the Committee has no jurisdiction to request the dropping of legal measures and judicial proceedings against offences laid down and sanctioned in the law and for which the corresponding legal procedures are established. By these recommendations the Committee is asking the Government to disregard domestic legislation and procedures laid down to sanction typical offences, which would give rise to a situation of impunity. The Government and the corresponding state bodies of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela respect and comply with the principles embodied in the Constitution and national legislation, and, given their full force in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the principle of the separation and independence of the different state branches; therefore the Government cannot comply with recommendations that are unfounded and that the Committee has no competence to make, and that are at odds with the constitutional principles and laws of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. On the other hand, the Committee also requests the Government to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services. The Committee is informed that this law was fully debated, discussed and adopted by the Venezuelan National Assembly, i.e. the legislative branch of the State. It was adopted to defend, protect, and safeguard the rights and interests of individuals in accessing goods and services in order to meet their needs. Section  concerns the penalties for any individual who impedes the production, manufacture, import, warehousing, transport, distribution or sales of commodities classified as being of prime necessity for the population.
.In this respect, the Government indicates that it finds itself in the position once again of having to explain to the Committee that any activity in relation to the production, distribution, and sale of gas constitutes in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela an essential service of prime necessity for the population. In order that the Committee can understand and take note of the necessity and predominance of this commodity in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the following information is provided:?According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), in  there were approximately ,, households in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Of these, ,, used liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and , used other energy sources.?At present  per cent of the population need LPG for cooking and other uses, thus its classification as an essential public service and of social and public interest.?Over , gas cylinders are distributed daily. If distribution were to be interrupted for just one day, it would affect over , Venezuelan households.?Besides for cooking, LPG is used in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in both heating and cooling systems.?LPG is used for cooking not only in Venezuelan homes but also in schools.?LPG is also used in health centres, clinics, hospitals, etc., for cooking, in heating and cooling systems, and in steam boilers to sterilize surgical instruments.?LPG is also distributed and used by commerce and industry, for example in bakeries, restaurants, refineries, petrochemical companies, etc.?The capture, storage or use of natural gas as well as gas produced from petroleum or other fossil fuels, and the processing, industrialization, transport, distribution, and domestic or foreign trading of these gases is governed by the Petroleum Act, published in Official Gazette No.  of  September .
.Section  of this Act stipulates  The activities referred to in this Act, as well as the works required for their management, are declared of public utility'  and section  states  Activities that are directly or indirectly related to the transport and distribution of hydrocarbon gases destined for public consumption constitute a public service' 
.The Act conferring on the State the Sole Rights to the Exploitation of the Domestic Market in Hydrocarbon Derivatives declares of public utility and national interest the exploitation of the domestic market for hydrocarbon derivatives such as, inter alia, combustible fuels and liquefied petroleum gas and, furthermore states that the activities of public interest reserved to the State under this law include the import, transport, supply, storage, distribution and sale of the abovementioned products within the national territory. It also declares liquefied petroleum gas of prime necessity. It constitutes an essential public service of public necessity since disruption or stoppage of activities relating to its production, distribution or sale would affect the vast majority of Venezuelan households as well as schools, care centres, commerce and industry. For these reasons the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela does not and shall not permit actions or omissions that affect the production or distribution of gas since they would jeopardize and infringe the Venezuelan population s right to food, health and life.
.The Government expects the Committee to take due note of this information and not make observations or requests that violate the principles of the State and are against domestic law.
.Finally, the Government is under the obligation once again to remind the Committee of Article () of Convention No. , which we fully observe and comply with:  In exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their respective organizations, like other persons or organized collectivities, shall respect the law of the land.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.With regard to the Committee s recommendation (a) contained in its previous examination of the case and the Government s view contained in its previous reply that it disagrees with the Committee s decision to designate this case as extremely serious and urgent given the continued lack of information from the complainant organization despite repeated requests, the Committee wishes to point out that in recommendations (b) and (c) of its previous examination of the case, the Committee refers to issues concerning the murders of three officials and two trade union delegates, the initiation of criminal proceedings and the arrest of six workers in the oil sector for paralysing state enterprise PDVSA s activities. In this regard, the Committee wishes to point out that the designation of a case as extremely serious and urgent is determined by the Committee on the basis of the seriousness of the issues raised and the information provided by the Government. The Committee wishes to emphasize that the murder of officials is always regarded within the ILO as serious and that in its rules of procedure (see rule ) it is expressly established that included in the category of urgent cases are  Matters involving human life or personal freedom ...' 
.With regard to recommendation (b) of the previous examination of the case concerning the murder of three officials and two trade union delegates, the Committee notes the Government s statements, according to which: () with regard to the point in which  the Committee expresses its grave concern about the serious allegations of murders of workers and union officials, which it deeply regrets'  the Government and the competent institutions have acted diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases fully and have fully complied with the obligation to inform the Committee on developments in these cases and to provide details of investigations being carried out by the Office of the Attorney-General, demonstrating their permanent commitment to providing all the required information; () with regard to the events concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez), according to the Office of the Attorney-General, on  October , the Third Court of First Instance, acting as overseeing court for the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the state of Anzotegui, in El Tigre, ruled that the case be closed in accordance with section (), and pursuant to section (), of the Code of Criminal Procedure. There is no ongoing investigation or file open on these events since, as explained in the previous reply, the case was closed when judicial proceedings were dropped following the death of the accused.
.The Committee wishes to recall its previous conclusions relating to these allegations [see th Report, paras ' ]:With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, General Secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, Organizational Secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, Culture and Sports Secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran), the Committee wishes to recall that it had requested the Government to intensify the judicial proceedings and investigations of the Office of the Attorney General in order to identify and severely punish the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices. The Committee had also requested the Government to keep it informed on the developments of the proceedings and",0,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
71,"expects that they will yield results in the near future.The Committee notes the Government s observation that the complaint was presented in June  and was subsequently transmitted to the Government, which sent its reply in October of the same year, i.e. only months after the complaint was presented, and that in this initial reply the Government informed the Committee of the investigations being conducted by the Office of the Attorney General, together with the names of the investigating bodies concerned, and of the steps taken by the Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigating Body. The Committee further notes the Government s indication that in March and May , it sent additional replies on the case, thus fulfilling its obligation to keep the Committee abreast of developments, and that in these replies the Government informed the Committee of the names of the persons allegedly responsible for the incidents, of the charges brought by the investigating bodies, of the crimes involved, of the state of the proceedings and of the hearings that had been held.The Committee notes that, in particular, the Government states that: () with respect to the murder of Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez on  June , in the state of Anzotegui, the Office of the Attorney General requested on  November  that the case be closed in accordance with section () of the Code of Criminal Procedure and pursuant to section () of this Code, since the criminal proceedings against the accused, Mr Pedro Guillermo Rondn, had been discontinued following his death while committing a common crime; and () with respect to the death of Mr David Alexander Zambrano and Mr Freddy Antonio Miranda Avendao in the Los Anaucos area of the state of Miranda, the Office of the Attorney General on  December  submitted an indictment against Mr Richard David Castillo and Mr Jorge Mizael Lpez, for committing aggravated homicide and illegally bearing a firearm who were currently awaiting trial, a hearing having been set for  April .The Committee also notes the Government s comment that it is at a loss to explain the Committee s contention that it should  act diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases fully'   intensify the judicial proceedings and investigations of the Office of the Attorney General' and  punish the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices'  inasmuch as Government and the competent institutions had proceeded with all the diligence and celerity that the cases warranted, with the sole purpose of clarifying the incidents and that the relevant investigations had been conducted and judicial proceedings instituted against the suspects who, should they be found guilty, would be punished in accordance with the law and as determined by the relevant authority. The Committee draws the Government s attention to the fact that its recommendations are intended to ensure the conviction in a court of law of those responsible for the murder of trade unionists and that the Government informed it only recently of the hearing that had been scheduled for  April  in the case of the murder of two such trade unionists.The Committee firmly trusts that judicial sentences will be handed down on the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In this regard, the Committee stresses that concerning the murders of officials Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, in its earlier conclusions and recommendations (to the extent that the Government stated that the accused had died while committing a common crime) it requested the Government to intensify the judicial proceedings and investigations of the Office of the Attorney-General in order to punish the instigators and accomplices (which would obviously entail an investigation that the Committee would like the authorities to carry out). The Committee urges the Government to expedite investigations in order to identify and punish the instigators or accomplices of the murders of these officials whose perpetrator according to investigations died while committing a common crime.
.With regard to the two trade union delegates, Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran, the Committee had noted in its previous examination of the case that an indictment had been submitted against Mr Richard David Castillo and Mr Jorge Mizael Lpez, for committing aggravated homicide and illegally bearing a firearm and who were currently awaiting trial, a hearing having been set for  April . The Committee regrets that in its response the Government did not provide information on the development of the judicial proceedings and investigations concerning the aggravated homicide of the two abovementioned trade union delegates, whether the two accused have been arrested, and once again firmly expects that the judicial authorities will hand down sentences on the perpetrators, should they be found guilty, and where possible on the instigators and accomplices. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.
.With regard to recommendation (c) of the previous examination of the case, the Committee wishes to recall the content of this recommendation:As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney General s preparation of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at PDVSA because, during a protest in defence of their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities, the Committee requests the Government or competent authorities to take the necessary measures to have the criminal proceedings brought against the six union officials at PDVSA dropped and to ensure their release without delay. The Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term and so that in no event may criminal sanctions be imposed in cases of peaceful strikes. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts to the legal aspects of this case.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that: () it cannot address the Committee s request to drop  without effect' measures and judicial proceedings which are in strict compliance with the relevant domestic legislation as well as due process and other principles; () the Committee has no jurisdiction to request the dropping of legal measures and judicial proceedings against offences laid down and sanctioned in the law and for which the corresponding legal procedures are established; () by these recommendations the Committee is asking the Government to disregard domestic legislation and procedures laid down to sanction established offences, which would give rise to a situation of impunity; and () the Government and the corresponding state bodies of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela respect and comply with the principles embodied in the constitution and domestic legislation, and, given their full force in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the principle of the separation and independence of the different state branches; therefore, the Government will not address recommendations that are unfounded, that the Committee has no competence to make, and that are at odds with the constitutional principles and laws of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee formulates its conclusions on these issues below but wishes to underline here that under its mandate it has the competence to consider whether domestic legislation and practice is in conformity with Conventions Nos  and  and freedom of association principles and that it is the practice on the basis of these principles to request governments to take measures to amend legislation or drop criminal proceedings.
.With regard to the Committee s recommendation to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services, the Government states that: () this law was fully debated, discussed and adopted by the Venezuelan National Assembly, i.e. the legislative branch of the State, and was adopted to defend, protect, and safeguard the rights and interests of individuals in accessing goods and services in order to meet their needs; () section  concerns the penalties for any individual who impedes the production, manufacture, import, warehousing, transport, distribution or sale of commodities classified as being of prime necessity for the population; () any activity in relation to the production, distribution, and sale of gas constitutes in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela an essential service of prime necessity for the population; millions of households use LPG and , households use other energy sources; at present  per cent of the population need LPG for cooking and other uses, whence its classification as an essential public service and of social and public interest; besides cooking, LPG is used in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in both heating and cooling systems; LPG is also used in health centres, clinics, hospitals, etc. for cooking, in heating and cooling systems, and in steam boilers to sterilize surgical instruments; LPG is distributed and used by commerce and",-1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
72,"industry, for example in bakeries, restaurants, refineries, petrochemical companies, etc.; finally, by law LPG constitutes an essential public service of public necessity since disruption or stoppage of activities relating to its production, distribution or sale would affect the vast majority of Venezuelan households as well as schools, assistance centres, commerce and industry; for these reasons the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela does not and shall not permit actions or omissions that affect the production or distribution of gas since they would jeopardize and infringe the population s right to food, health and life; and () the Government recalls Article () of Convention No. , which states that:  In exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their respective organizations, like other persons or organized collectivities, shall respect the law of the land.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.Furthermore, on this last statement by the Government, the Committee wishes to draw the Government s attention to Article () of Convention No.  which states:  The law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in this Convention.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Committee wishes to highlight that PDVSA is the largest enterprise in the country and that its activities in the petroleum sector do not only include LPG but also the extremely important activities of prospecting, refining and exporting petroleum and its derivatives, that is production and commercial activities which, if temporarily halted, would not endanger the life, security or health of the population. Noting that the law to which the Government refers imposes a complete prohibition of strikes in the petroleum sector, the Committee recalls that it has considered on previous occasions that the petroleum sector as well as the production, transport and distribution of fuel do not constitute essential services in the strict sense of the term [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. However, the Committee has also noted that minimum service requirements could be introduced for  public services of fundamental importance' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ] such as in the case of the petroleum sector in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee notes in this regard that the petroleum sector can introduce minimum service requirements in order that the concerns raised by the Government regarding the supply of LPG to schools and hospitals may be overcome.
.Therefore, the Committee maintains the recommendation formulated in its previous examination of the case concerning the need to amend the legislation and once again draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case. Furthermore, with regard to the arrest and initiation of criminal proceedings against six striking workers of the state enterprise PDVSA, the Committee recalls that the authorities should not resort to arrests and imprisonment in connection with the organization of or participation in a peaceful strike; such measures entail serious risks of abuse and are a grave threat to freedom of association [Digest, op. cit., para. ], and that no one should be deprived of their freedom or be subject to penal sanctions for the mere fact of organizing or participating in a peaceful strike [Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee therefore maintains its previous recommendation and urges the Government and the competent authorities to take measures to have the criminal proceedings brought against the six workers at PDVSA by the Office of the Attorney-General dropped and to ensure their release.
.With regard to recommendation (d) of the previous examination of the case, the Committee notes that the complainant organization has not communicated the additional information requested for a fourth consecutive time and, therefore, the Committee is not in a position at this time to examine these allegations, despite their seriousness. The Committee firmly expects that the alleged acts will be the subject of an independent investigation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, General Secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, Organizational Secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, Culture and Sports Secretary) the Committee urges the Government to expedite investigations in order to identify and punish the instigators or accomplices of the murders of these officials whose perpetrator according to investigations died while committing a common crime.(b)	With regard to the murder of the two trade union delegates, Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran, the Committee regrets that in its response the Government did not provide information on developments in the judicial proceedings and investigations concerning the aggravated homicide of the two abovementioned trade union delegates and whether the two accused have been arrested, and once again firmly expects that the judicial authorities will hand down sentences on the perpetrators, should they be found guilty, and where possible on the instigators and accomplices. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(c)	As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney-General s preparation of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at PDVSA because, during a protest in defence of their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities, the Committee urges the Government and the competent authorities to take the necessary measures to have the criminal proceedings brought against the six union officials at PDVSA dropped and to ensure their release without delay. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term and so that in no event may criminal sanctions be imposed in cases of peaceful strikes. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d)	The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts to the legal aspects of this case.(e)	The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of the matters dealt with in this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session held in November ].
.The Government sent additional observations in a communication dated  February .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in November , the Committee made the following recommendations concerning the outstanding issues [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee expresses its grave concern about the serious allegations of murders of workers and union officials, which it deeply regrets, and urges the Government to act diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases fully.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran), the Committee requests the Government to intensify the judicial proceedings and investigations of the Office of the AttorneyGeneral in order to identify and severely punish the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the developments of the proceedings and expects that they will yield results in the near future.(c) Concerning the allegations in relation to the contract killings of more than  workers and union officials in the construction sector, the Committee requests the trade union to provide the Government without delay with a list of these murders and the circumstances thereof so that the Government can undertake the appropriate investigations without delay.(d) As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney-General s preparation of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at PDVSA because, during a protest in defence of their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities, the Committee requests the Government or competent authorities to take the necessary measures to have the criminal proceedings brought against the six union officials at PDVSA dropped and to ensure their release without delay. The Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term and so that in no event may criminal sanctions be imposed in cases of",0,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
73,"peaceful strikes. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts to the legal aspects of this case.(e) With respect to the allegations concerning the criminalization of protests, the initiation of judicial proceedings at various enterprises in the oil, gas and steel sectors, and the dismissal of union officials as a result of these protests (according to the CTV, judicial proceedings were started against  workers at the state holding PDVSA,  workers at the  Alfredo Maneiro' Orinoco steelworks for staging a protest in defence of their labour rights and ten trade union delegates of the  El Palito' refinery were dismissed after  workers decided to stop work as a result of failure to abide by commitments under the collective agreement. According to the CTV, workers at the enterprises Gas PetroPiar and Gas Comunal have also been affected), the Committee again requests the complainant to send the text of the accusations allegedly made against the union members in question.(f) With regard to the criminal court proceedings against  workers for claiming their rights, the Committee again requests the complainant organization to supply additional information concerning these allegations, specifically, the names of those involved and the activities they are alleged to have undertaken, so that the Government can send its observations in this regard.(g) The Committee again invites the complainant organization to indicate whether the collective bargaining rights of its affiliates have been respected in the bargaining processes mentioned by the Government.(h) The Committee calls the Governing Body s attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communication dated  February  the Government states, first and foremost, that it is concerned at the degree of incongruence and inconsistency between the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the designation of Case No.  as  extremely serious and urgent'  In particular, the Committee notes that it has received information from the Venezuelan Government on Case No.  which it intends to examine at its next meeting, yet in paragraph  of its th Report it agrees with the Government and requests the complainant organization to provide detailed information to the Government on its allegations and on the circumstances surrounding them without delay, so that the Government can conduct the relevant investigations. In point of fact, four of the Committee s six recommendations (namely, (c), (e), (f) and (g)) call on the complainant organization specifically to provide information. As to the other two recommendations brought to its attention, the Government has since , when the complaint was first presented, informed the Committee of developments in the relevant inquiries and on the steps taken regarding the incidents that took place in El Tigre, in the state of Anzotegui, and in the Los Anaucos area. It has also informed the Committee of the legal proceedings brought by the Office of the Attorney-General against six former Petrleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) employees on suspicion of criminal activities. In the light of the foregoing, and as the Government stated at the th Session of the Governing Body when the report of the Committee on Freedom of Association was adopted, it categorically rejects the Committee s designation of this case as  extremely serious and urgent'  given that the Committee has yet to examine the latest replies from the Government and that the complainant organization has still not supplied the information requested of it ' always bearing in mind that four of the Committee s six recommendations concern it directly.
.The Government goes on to refer to recommendations (a) and (b) of the Committee, in which it recommends, in regard to the serious allegations of murders of workers and union officials, that the Government  act diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases fully' and that it  intensify the judicial proceedings and investigations of the Office of the AttorneyGeneral in order to identify and severely punish the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices'  On this point the Government observes that the complaint was presented in June  and was subsequently transmitted to the Government, which sent its reply in October of the same year, i.e. only months after the complaint was presented. In this initial reply, the Government informed the Committee of the investigations being conducted by the Office of the Attorney-General, together with the names of the investigating bodies concerned, and of the steps taken by the Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigating Body. In March and May  the Government sent additional replies on the case, thus fulfilling its obligation to keep the Committee abreast of developments. In its replies it informed the Committee of the names of the persons allegedly responsible for the incidents, of the charges brought by the investigating bodies, of the crimes involved, of the state of the proceedings and of the hearings that had been held.
.Specifically, with respect to the murder of Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez on  June , in the state of Anzotegui, the Government states that on  November  the Office of the AttorneyGeneral requested that the case be closed in accordance with section (), and pursuant to section (), of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since criminal proceedings against the accused, Mr Pedro Guillermo Rondn, had been dropped following his death while committing a common crime. Similarly, with respect to the death of David Alexander Zambrano and Freddy Antonio Miranda Avendao in the Los Anaucos area of the state of Miranda, the Government informed the Committee that on  December  the Office of the Attorney-General charged Mr Richard David Castillo and Mr Jorge Mizael Lpez with aggravated homicide and illegally bearing a firearm; the latter were currently awaiting trial and a hearing had been set for  April .
.In the light of the foregoing, the Government states that it is at a loss to explain the Committee s contention that it should  act diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases fully'   intensify the judicial proceedings and investigations of the Office of the AttorneyGeneral' and  punish the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices' since together with the competent institutions it has proceeded with all the diligence and celerity that these cases warrant, with the sole purpose of clarifying the incidents. The Government emphasizes that the Office of the Attorney-General and the other institutions concerned have conducted their respective investigations and are instituting judicial proceedings against the suspects who, should they be found guilty, will be punished in accordance with the law and as determined by the relevant authority.
.This being so, the Government is unable to comprehend the Committee s injunctions, as it considers that in this and in all other cases it has acted with the utmost celerity, transparency and diligence in its efforts to clarify the matters at issue and that it has moreover always demonstrated its willingness to cooperate with this supervisory body of the ILO by providing it with the information it has requested.
.With regard to the alleged indictment and arrest of six employees of PDVSA AS (Larry Antonio Pedroza, Jos Antonio Tovar, Ivn Ramn Aparicio Martnez, Jaffet Enrique Castillo Surez, Rey Rgulo Chaparro Hernndez and Jos Luis Hernndez lvaro), their arrest was due to the fact that these workers were charged with boycotting, a punishable offence under section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services. After investigation and in conformity with the due process of law, the Office of the Attorney-General brought formal charges against the six employees. A preliminary hearing was postponed to  March .
.The Government states that the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services is designed to defend, protect and safeguard the rights and interests of individuals and groups in accessing goods and services, in order to meet the population s needs and protect social peace, justice, and the right to life and health of the population. Specifically, section  of the Act stipulates that anyone who carries out an action or is responsible for an omission that impedes the production, manufacture, importation, warehousing, transport, distribution or sales of commodities classified as being of prime necessity shall be liable to a prison term of six to ten years. Neither this Act nor any other curtails the right to strike or imposes criminal sanctions for staging a peaceful strike that does not affect commodities classified as prime necessities for the population. On the contrary, the Act protects the people s right of access to goods and products classified as prime necessities and punishes anyone who endangers their production and distribution. The Government cannot therefore accede to the Committee s recommendation that it annul the criminal charges brought against persons who committed crimes that are punishable under the country s laws and regulations, as this would be tantamount to the State condoning situations of impunity and would run counter to the values and",1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
74,"principles embodied in the Venezuelan Constitution.
.The Government states further that the Committee argues that gas is not an essential service for the population. However, the Government insists that any activity in relation to gas and its sale constitutes in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela an essential service of prime necessity for the population, inasmuch as its interruption could endanger people s lives, safety or health. The Government wishes to inform the Committee that most homes in the country use gas to cook, which means that interrupting its supply and sale is a breach of the right to food and, therefore, of the Venezuelan population s right to health and to life.
.Before it examines the substance of the issues still pending and noting that the Government challenges the inclusion of the case in the category of  extremely serious and urgent' cases, given the information provided, notably on the current legal proceedings, and that it is awaiting additional information from the complainant organization, the Committee wishes to emphasize that some of the alleged incidents ' incidents that have been recognized by the Government itself ' relate to the murder of trade union officials. The Committee also notes that the consideration of serious and urgent cases in its reports is decided upon after an objective discussion that takes into account all the known facts.
.With regard to recommendations (c), (e), (f) and (g) requesting additional information from the complainant organization, the Committee regrets that for the third time the organization has failed to send the information and informs it that, if it fails to do so before the next consideration of the case, the Committee will not be in a position to pursue its examination of the allegations.
.The Committee therefore reiterates its earlier recommendations to the complainant organization:' concerning the allegations in relation to the contract killings of more than  workers and union officials in the construction sector, the Committee requests the trade union to provide the Government, without delay, with a list of these murders and the circumstances thereof so that the Government can undertake the appropriate investigations without delay;' with respect to the allegations concerning the criminalization of protests, the initiation of judicial proceedings at various enterprises in the oil, gas and steel sectors, and the dismissal of union officials as a result of these protests (according to the Workers' Confederation of Venezuela (CTV), judicial proceedings were started against  workers at the state holding PDVSA,  workers at the  Alfredo Maneiro' Orinoco steelworks for staging a protest in defence of their labour rights and ten trade union delegates of the  El Palito' refinery were dismissed after  workers decided to stop work as a result of failure to abide by commitments under the collective agreement; according to the CTV, workers at the enterprises Gas PetroPiar and Gas Comunal have also been affected), the Committee again requests the complainant to send the text of the accusations allegedly made against the union members in question;' with regard to the criminal court proceedings against  workers for claiming their rights, the Committee again requests the complainant organization to supply additional information concerning these allegations, specifically, the names of those involved and the activities they are alleged to have undertaken, so that the Government can send its observations in this regard;' the Committee again invites the complainant organization to indicate whether the collective bargaining rights of its affiliates have been respected in the bargaining processes mentioned by the Government.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran), the Committee wishes to recall that it had requested the Government to intensify the judicial proceedings and investigations of the Office of the Attorney-General in order to identify and severely punish the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices. The Committee had also requested the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings and trusts that they will yield results in the near future.
.The Committee notes the Government s observation that the complaint was presented in June  and was subsequently transmitted to the Government, which sent its reply in October of the same year, i.e. only months after the complaint was presented, and that in this initial reply the Government informed the Committee of the investigations being conducted by the Office of the Attorney-General, together with the names of the investigating bodies concerned, and of the steps taken by the Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigating Body. The Committee further notes the Government s indication that in March and May , it sent additional replies on the case, thus fulfilling its obligation to keep the Committee abreast of developments, and that in these replies the Government informed the Committee of the names of the persons allegedly responsible for the incidents, of the charges brought by the investigating bodies, of the crimes involved, of the state of the proceedings and of the hearings that had been held.
.The Committee notes that, in particular, the Government states that: () with respect to the murder of Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez on  June , in the state of Anzotegui, the Office of the AttorneyGeneral requested on  November  that the case be closed in accordance with section () of the Code of Criminal Procedure and pursuant to section () of this Code, since the criminal proceedings against the accused, Mr Pedro Guillermo Rondn, had been discontinued following his death while committing a common crime; and () with respect to the death of Mr David Alexander Zambrano and Mr Freddy Antonio Miranda Avendao in the Los Anaucos area of the state of Miranda, the Office of the Attorney-General on  December  submitted an indictment against Mr Richard David Castillo and Mr Jorge Mizael Lpez, for committing aggravated homicide and illegally bearing a firearm who were currently awaiting trial, a hearing having been set for  April .
.The Committee also notes the Government s comment that it is at a loss to explain the Committee s contention that it should  act diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases fully'   intensify the judicial proceedings and investigations of the Office of the AttorneyGeneral' and  punish the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices'  inasmuch as Government and the competent institutions had proceeded with all the diligence and celerity that the cases warranted, with the sole purpose of clarifying the incidents and that the relevant investigations had been conducted and judicial proceedings instituted against the suspects who, should they be found guilty, would be punished in accordance with the law and as determined by the relevant authority. The Committee draws the Government s attention to the fact that its recommendations are intended to ensure the conviction in a court of law of those responsible for the murder of trade unionists and that the Government informed it only recently of the hearing that had been scheduled for  April  in the case of the murder of two such trade unionists.
.The Committee firmly trusts that judicial sentences will be handed down on the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney-General s preparation of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at PDVSA because, during a protest in defence of their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities, the Committee wishes to recall that it had requested the Government or competent authorities to take the necessary measures to have the criminal proceedings brought against the six union officials at PDVSA dropped and to ensure their release without delay. The Committee also requested the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term and so that in no event may criminal sanctions be imposed in cases of peaceful strikes. The Committee drew the attention of the Committee of Experts to the legislative aspect of this case.
.The Committee notes the Government s comments on these recommendations and, notably: () that the six employees of PDVSA AS (Larry Antonio Pedroza, Jos Antonio Tovar, Ivn Ramn Aparicio Martnez, Jaffet Enrique Castillo Surez, Rey Rgulo Chaparro Hernndez and Jos Luis Hernndez lvaro) were arrested on the charge of boycotting, which is a punishable offence under section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services, and that, upon investigation and in conformity with the due process of law, the Office of the Attorney-General",0,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
75,"brought formal charges against the six workers, a preliminary hearing having been postponed to  March ; () that the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services is designed to defend, protect and safeguard the rights and interests of individuals and groups in accessing goods and services in order to meet the population s needs and protect social peace, justice, and the right to life and health of the population and that section  of the Act stipulates that anyone who carries out an action or is responsible for an omission that impedes the production, manufacture, importation, warehousing, transport, distribution or sales of commodities classified as being of prime necessity shall be liable to a prison term of between six and ten years; () that neither this Act nor any other curtails the right to strike or imposes criminal sanctions for staging a peaceful strike that does not affect commodities classified as prime necessities for the population and that, on the contrary, the Act protects the people s right of access to goods and products classified as prime necessities and punishes anyone who endangers their production and distribution; () that the Government cannot therefore accede to the Committee s recommendation that it annul the criminal charges brought against persons who committed crimes identified in the country s laws and regulations and punishable accordingly, inasmuch as this would be tantamount to the State condoning situations of impunity and would run counter to the values and principles embodied in the Venezuelan Constitution; () while the Committee observes that gas is not an essential service for the population, the Government insists on this point, that any activity in relation to gas and its sale constitutes in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela an essential service of prime necessity for the population, inasmuch as its interruption could endanger people s lives, safety or health; and that most homes in the country use gas to cook, which means that interrupting the supply and sale of this product is deemed to be a breach of the right to food and, therefore, of the Venezuelan population s right to health and to life.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not complied with the recommendations formulated in its previous examination of the case and can only reiterate the arguments it advanced on that occasion. The Committee therefore refers once again to the following conclusions that it reached at the time [see th Report, paras ' ]:As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney-General s filing of criminal charges for the offence of boycotting and the subsequent detention of six workers of the PDVSA enterprise (Mr Larry Antonio Pedroza, trade union delegate, Mr Jos Antonio Tovar, Mr Juan Ramn Aparicio, Mr Jafet Enrique Castillo Surez, Mr Roy Rogelio Chaparro Hernndez and Mr Jos Luis Hernndez Alvarado) because, during a protest to demand their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities (according to the Unitary Federation of Workers in the Petrol, Gas and Similar Industries of Venezuela (FUTPV), the Office of the Attorney-General is being used by the Government), the Committee noted that the Government had stated that, on  June , a group of workers, as part of a demonstration, paralysed the plant s gas canister filling activities, affecting the sale of a commodity of prime necessity, for which they were arrested. On  June , the Second Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the state of Miranda summoned them to appear at a hearing, during which the th Prosecutor qualified the events as a boycott under section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services, which states:  Anyone who, jointly or individually, plans or carries out an action or is responsible for an omission that directly or indirectly impedes the production, manufacture, importation, warehousing, transport, distribution or sales of commodities classified as being of prime necessity shall be liable to a prison term of between six and ten years'  The Committee also noted that the Government indicated that section  of the aforementioned Act does not apply to the right to peaceful assembly [see th report, para. ].The Committee notes that in its latest reply the Government reiterates these statements and adds that the judicial authority has set the preliminary hearing for  June . It states that because gas is used in most homes to cook, the interruption of the supply and sale of this product constitutes a breach of the right to food and therefore the right to health and to life of the population. The Committee notes that in the Government s opinion this issue involves a service that is essential and of prime necessity, whose interruption could endanger people s lives, safety or health. Finally, the Committee notes that the Act does not impose sanctions for holding a strike which does not affect commodities of prime necessity for the population, which the law must protect.In this regard, the Committee underlines that the activity of filling and selling gas canisters does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term ' i.e. where the interruption of a service could endanger the life, personal safety or health of all or part of the population, for which the exercise of the right to strike or the interruption of activities can be totally prohibited ' and even less so when the argument put forward is that this is a product that most homes use to cook. The Committee also considers that the peaceful exercise of those trade union rights should not be the subject of criminal proceedings or result in the detention of trade union officials who have organized these strikes on boycotting charges, as is the present case, by virtue of section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services. This being the case, the Committee recalls that the detention of trade union officials and members for carrying out legal trade union activities constitutes a violation of freedom of association. The Committee, noting that the Government declares that it cannot discontinue the criminal proceedings, recalls that the public authorities must respect the ratified ILO Conventions. The Committee requests the Government or the competent authority once again to take the necessary measures to discontinue the criminal proceedings brought against the six trade union officials of the PDVSA Gas Comunal and to release them without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services (which includes criminal sanctions for the paralysis of activities) so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term, and so that in no event criminal sanctions are imposed in cases of peaceful strike. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations once again to the legal aspect of this case. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee reiterates its earlier conclusions and recommendations regarding these matters.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expresses its grave concern about the serious allegations of murders of workers and union officials, which it deeply regrets.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran), the Committee firmly trusts that judicial sentences will be handed down on the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices in the near future. The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney-General s preparation of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at PDVSA because, during a protest in defence of their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities, the Committee requests the Government or competent authorities to take the necessary measures to have the criminal proceedings brought against the six union officials at PDVSA dropped and to ensure their release without delay. The Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term and so that in no event may criminal sanctions be imposed in cases of peaceful strikes. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this",-1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
76,"regard. It once again draws the attention of the Committee of Experts to the legislative aspect of this case.(d) The Committee regrets that for the third consecutive time the complainant organization has failed to send the additional information requested in its earlier conclusions and recommendations and informs it that, if it fails to do so before the next consideration of the case, the Committee will not be in a position to pursue its examination of the allegations. The Committee reproduces its earlier recommendations below:' Concerning the allegations in relation to the contract killings of more than  workers and union officials in the construction sector, the Committee requests the trade union to provide the Government, without delay, with a list of these murders and the circumstances thereof so that the Government can undertake the appropriate investigations without delay.' With respect to the allegations concerning the criminalization of protests, the initiation of judicial proceedings at various enterprises in the oil, gas and steel sectors, and the dismissal of union officials as a result of these protests (according to the CTV, judicial proceedings were started against  workers at the state holding PDVSA,  workers at the  Alfredo Maneiro' Orinoco steelworks for staging a protest in defence of their labour rights and  trade union delegates of the  El Palito' refinery were dismissed after  workers decided to stop work as a result of failure to abide by commitments under the collective agreement; according to the CTV, workers at the enterprises Gas PetroPiar and Gas Comunal have also been affected), the Committee again requests the complainant to send the text of the accusations allegedly made against the union members in question.' With regard to the criminal court proceedings against  workers for claiming their rights, the Committee again requests the complainant organization to supply additional information concerning these allegations, specifically, the names of those involved and the activities they are alleged to have undertaken, so that the Government can send its observations in this regard.' The Committee again invites the complainant organization to indicate whether the collective bargaining rights of its affiliates have been respected in the bargaining processes mentioned by the Government.(e) The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of the matters dealt with in this case.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in March  and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations regarding the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee expresses its grave concern at the serious allegations of murders of workers and union officials and urges the Government to act diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases fully.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran), the Committee requests the Government to explain the reasons for the termination of the criminal proceedings and expects that new investigations will be initiated and will yield results in the near future and will enable the perpetrators to be identified and punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) Concerning the allegations in relation to the contract killings of more than  workers and union officials in the construction sector, the Committee requests the trade union to provide the Government without delay with a list of these murders and the circumstances involved so that the Government can undertake the appropriate investigations without delay.

The Committee draws this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts.(e) Relating to the allegations concerning the criminalization of protests and the initiation of judicial proceedings at various enterprises in the oil, gas and steel sectors, and the dismissal of union officials as a result of these protests, the Committee requests the complainant to send the text of the accusations allegedly made against the union members in question.(f) With regard to the criminal court proceedings against  workers for claiming their rights, the Committee requests the complainant organization to supply supplementary information concerning these allegations, specifically, the names of those involved and the activities they are alleged to have undertaken, so that the Government can send its observations in this regard.(g) The Committee invites the complainant organization to indicate whether the collective bargaining rights of its affiliates have been respected in the bargaining processes mentioned by the Government.(h) The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government refers to the events which occurred in El Tigre, in the state of Anzotegui, and reiterates that concerning the murders of Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez on  June  on the road from El Tigre to Caico Seco in front of the La Maravilla finca, in the state of Anzotegui, the Office of the Attorney-General requested on  November  the closing of the case (a nolle prosequi) in accordance with the provisions in section () of the Code of Criminal Procedure and pursuant to section () of this Code, discontinuing the criminal proceedings against the accused, Mr Pedro Guillermo Rondn, because of his death while committing a common crime of which he was allegedly the perpetrator.
.The Government specifies that the discontinuance of criminal proceedings is based on a number of grounds established in section  of the Venezuelan Code of Criminal Procedure, namely:Section . Grounds. Criminal proceedings are discontinued in the event of:
.The death of the accused.
.Amnesty.
.The withdrawal or abandonment of the private prosecution brought by the aggrieved party.
.Payment of the maximum fine, prior to the admission of the offence, for offences that are punishable by fine.
.The application of the principle of opportunity, subject to the provisions of this Code.
.Fulfilment of compensation agreements.
.Compliance with obligations and expiry of the deadline for the conditional suspension of the proceedings, following verification by the judge in the respective hearing.
.The lapse of the statute of limitation, except where this is waived by the accused.
.The Government goes on to say that one of the grounds for discontinuing criminal proceedings is the death of the person charged with the offence; from the discontinuance of the proceedings, the request for a nolle prosequi arises in accordance with section  of the aforementioned Code, which reads as follows:Section . Nolle prosequi. A nolle prosequi shall be entered when:
.The act which is the subject of the proceedings is not carried out or cannot be attributed to the accused.
.The alleged act is atypical or constitutes a ground of justification, innocence or exemption from punishment.
.The criminal proceedings have been dropped or are res judicata.
.Despite the lack of certainty, there is no reasonable possibility of including new data in the investigation and there are no reasonable grounds to request the trial of the accused.
.It is so established by this Code.
.To this end, the Government highlights that entering a nolle prosequi  puts an end to the proceedings and has the force of res judicata. Thereby preventing any new trial from being brought against the accused or defendant ... thus removing all restraining orders which have been ruled' (section , Code of Criminal Procedure). Nevertheless, despite the nolle prosequi in the proceedings against Mr Pedro Guillermo Rondn due to the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings caused by his",1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
77,"death, the Office of the Attorney-General reported that it would continue its investigations into these events.
.With regard to the events which took place in the Los Anaucos area, in the state of Miranda, the Government declares that on  December  the Office of the Attorney-General submitted an indictment against Mr Richard David Castillo and Mr Jorge Mizael Lpez for committing aggravated homicide and illegally bearing a firearm, leading to the death of David Alexnder Zambrano and Freddy Antonio Miranda Avendao, trade union officials. The preliminary hearing was held on  February  at the competent monitoring court, which established probable cause, moving proceedings onto the trial phase and setting a date for the oral and public hearing for  June .
.With regard to the case brought for the detention of six workers of PDVSA AS, Mr Larry Antonio Pedroza, Mr Jos Antonio Tovar, Mr Juan Ramn Aparicio Martnez, Mr Jaffet Enrique Castillo Surez, Mr Rey Rgulo Chaparro Hernndez and Mr Jos Luis Hernndez lvaro, the Government indicates that the said persons were brought before the appropriate court for the offence of boycotting, provided for and punishable under section  of the decree having the rank, value and force of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services. The Office of the Attorney-General took this opportunity to request the application of the ordinary procedure and of a preventive detention measure, to which the judicial body agreed. Subsequently, following an exhaustive investigation and due process, the Office of the Attorney-General submitted, on the basis of the witness reports and the results of the technical inquiry, technical legal examination and photomontage, a formal indictment against the aforementioned persons, establishing the relevant courts and the date of the preliminary hearing for  March  even though the date was then postponed to  June  for failure to appear by one of the accused.
.The Government points out, with regard to section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services, that this Act was published in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on  April , and that its purpose is to defend, protect and safeguard the rights and interests of individuals and groups in accessing goods and services in order to meet the population s needs and protect social peace, justice, and the right to life and health of the population. More specifically, section  of this Act establishes the following:Section . Anyone who, jointly or individually, plans or carries out an action or is responsible for an omission that directly or indirectly impedes the production, manufacture, importation, warehousing, transport, distribution or sales of commodities classified as being of prime necessity shall be liable to a prison term of between six and ten years.
.This section refers to the offence of boycotting. It is necessary to clarify that it does not set out criminal sanctions for staging a strike which does not affect commodities classified as prime necessities for the population given that, in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, striking is a constitutional right. However, it does set out sanctions for any person who puts at risk the production and distribution of primary commodities which, far from limiting a right, protects the people s right to access commodities classified as being of prime necessity.
.The Government points out that any activity in relation to gas and the process of selling gas constitutes, in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, an essential service of prime necessity for the population, where an essential service is understood to be a service whose interruption could endanger people s lives, safety or health. Similar to many countries in the world, most homes in the country use gas to cook, which means that interrupting the supply and sale of this product is a breach of the right to food and, therefore, the right to health and the right to life of the people.
.With regard to this point, the Committee once again requested the Government to drop the criminal proceedings and to release the persons who had committed offences punishable under Venezuelan law. This being the case, if the Government were to comply with the Committee s recommendations, it would create a situation of impunity, which would go against the values and principles that are enshrined in the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and are part of a democratic and social State under the rule of law and justice.
.The Government expects that its reply will be given careful and due consideration.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations made by the CTV refer to the following issues: () the murder of three union officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary) and two union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran); () the contract killings of more than  workers and union officials in the construction sector; () the Office of the Attorney-General has brought charges of boycotting against six workers (Mr Larry Antonio Pedroza, union delegate, Mr Jos Antonio Tovar, Mr Juan Ramn Aparicio, Mr Jafet Enrique Castillo Surez, Mr Roy Rogelio Chaparro Hernndez and Mr Jos Luis Hernndez Alvarado) of the enterprise Petrleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) Gas Comunal for staging protests to demand their labour rights; () the criminalization of protests, the initiation of legal proceedings at various enterprises and the dismissal of union officials in connection with the protests; and () the persistent refusal of the public authorities to collectively bargain in the oil, electricity and national university sector, among others.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the murder of three union officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary), and two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran), the Committee had noted at its meeting in March  that the Office of the Attorney-General requested on  November  the nolle prosequi due to the death of the accused persons, Pedro Guillermo Rondn and Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, in accordance with the provisions of section () of the Code of Criminal Procedure in line with section (), grounds for discontinuing the criminal proceedings. The Committee had requested the Government to explain why the criminal proceedings had been discontinued and expected that new investigations would be initiated, yield results in the very near future and enable the perpetrators to be identified and punished.
.The Committee notes that in its latest reply the Government declares that regarding the murder of the union officials, Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, on  June , and in accordance with the law the criminal case remained closed because of the death of Mr Pedro Guillermo Rondn (accused of the aforementioned murders and who died in the act of committing the common crime of which he was the alleged perpetrator) which is why the Office of the Attorney-General requested the discontinuance of the proceedings. The Committee notes that the Government reports that the Office of the Attorney-General has nevertheless continued to carry out the relevant investigations.
.The Committee wishes to recall that in its previous reply the Government referred to the deaths of both persons accused of murder (Pedro Guillermo Rondn and Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avila) and not only the death of the former, which is the case now. The Committee highlights the importance of stepping up the investigation in order to identify and punish the perpetrators (whether they are alive or dead), but also in order to severely punish the instigators and accomplices. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Committee furthermore highlights that in its allegations the CTV also refers to the murder of two trade union delegates in June  in the Los Anaucos area (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matas Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran). The Committee requests the Government to intensify the Office of the Attorney-General s legal procedures and investigation without delay with the aim of identifying and severely punishing the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices. The Committee notes that the Government refers to the murder of the trade union officials in the Los Anaucos area, Mr Alexnder Zambrano and Mr Freddy Antonio Miranda (events which are not however mentioned in the CTV s complaint) stating that Mr Richard David Castillo and Mr Jorge Mizael Lpez are accused of aggravated homicide and bearing firearms and are awaiting the oral and public hearing on  June .
.The Committee expresses its serious concern about the murder of the union officials mentioned in this complaint, which it deeply regrets.
.The Committee recalls that freedom of association can",-1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
78,"only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed regarding the development of the proceedings and investigations and expects that they will yield results in the near future and enable the perpetrators to be identified and punished.
.Concerning the allegations in relation to the contract killings of more than  workers and union officials in the construction sector, the Committee requests the trade union once again to provide the Government without delay with a list of the murders and the circumstances thereof so that the Government can undertake the appropriate investigations without delay.
.As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney-General s filing of criminal charges for the offence of boycotting and the subsequent detention of six workers of the PDVSA enterprise (Mr Larry Antonio Pedroza, trade union delegate, Mr Jos Antonio Tovar, Mr Juan Ramn Aparicio, Mr Jafet Enrique Castillo Surez, Mr Roy Rogelio Chaparro Hernndez and Mr Jos Luis Hernndez Alvarado) because, during a protest to demand their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities (according to the Unitary Federation of Workers in the Petrol, Gas and Similar Industries of Venezuela (FUTPV), the Office of the Attorney-General is being used by the Government), the Committee noted that the Government had stated that, on  June , a group of workers, as part of a demonstration, paralysed the plant s gas canister filling activities, affecting the sale of a commodity of prime necessity, for which they were arrested. On  June , the Second Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the state of Miranda summoned them to appear at a hearing, during which the th Prosecutor qualified the events as a boycott under section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services, which states:  Anyone who, jointly or individually, plans or carries out an action or is responsible for an omission that directly or indirectly impedes the production, manufacture, importation, warehousing, transport, distribution or sales of commodities classified as being of prime necessity shall be liable to a prison term of between six and ten years'  The Committee also noted that the Government indicated that section  of the aforementioned Act does not apply to the right to peaceful assembly [see th report, para. ].
.The Committee notes that in its latest reply the Government reiterates these statements and adds that the judicial authority has set the preliminary hearing for  June . It states that because gas is used in most homes to cook, the interruption of the supply and sale of this product constitutes a breach of the right to food and therefore the right to health and to life of the population. The Committee notes that in the Government s opinion this issue involves a service that is essential and of prime necessity, whose interruption could endanger people s lives, safety or health. Finally, the Committee notes that the Act does not impose sanctions for holding a strike which does not affect commodities of prime necessity for the population, which the law must protect.
.In this regard, the Committee underlines that the activity of filling and selling gas canisters does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term ' i.e. where the interruption of a service could endanger the life, personal safety or health of all or part of the population, for which the exercise of the right to strike or the interruption of activities can be totally prohibited ' and even less so when the argument put forward is that this is a product that most homes use to cook. The Committee also considers that the peaceful exercise of those trade union rights should not be the subject of criminal proceedings or result in the detention of trade union officials who have organized these strikes on boycotting charges, as is the present case, by virtue of section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services. This being the case, the Committee recalls that the detention of trade union officials and members for carrying out legal trade union activities constitutes a violation of freedom of association. The Committee, noting that the Government declares that it cannot discontinue the criminal proceedings, recalls that the public authorities must respect the ratified ILO Conventions. The Committee requests the Government or the competent authority once again to take the necessary measures to discontinue the criminal proceedings brought against the six trade union officials of the PDVSA Gas Comunal and to release them without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services (which includes criminal sanctions for the paralysis of activities) so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term, and so that in no event criminal sanctions are imposed in cases of peaceful strike. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations once again to the legal aspect of this case. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.With respect to the allegations concerning the criminalization of protests, the initiation of legal proceedings at various enterprises in the oil, gas and steel sectors, and the dismissal of trade union officials as a result of these protests, the Committee had noted in its previous examination of the case that, according to the CTV, judicial proceedings had been brought against  workers at the state holding PDVSA,  workers at the  Alfredo Maneiro' Orinoco steelworks for staging a protest in defence of their labour rights and that ten trade union delegates at the  El Palito' refinery were dismissed after  workers decided to stop work as a result of failure to abide by commitments under the collective agreement. According to the CTV, workers at the enterprises Gas PetroPiar and Gas Comunal have also been affected [see th Report, para. ]. The Committee also noted in its previous examination of the case the CTV s allegations that around  workers have been taken to court for claiming their labour rights. In this regard, the Committee noted that, according to the Government, the Office of the Ombudsman had received no complaints and had not carried out any investigations concerning these allegations; on the contrary, the Ombudsman had intervened in various labour disputes at PDVSA, assisting in resolving them through mediation, without learning of any detentions or criminal proceedings in any of the disputes. Given the contradiction between the allegations and the Government s reply, the Committee requested the complainant to send the text of the accusations allegedly made against the union members in question. The Committee observes that it has not received such texts and reiterates its previous recommendation to the complainant.
.Relating to the criminal court proceedings against  workers for claiming their rights, the Committee again requests the complainant organization to supply additional information concerning these allegations, specifically, the names of those involved and a description of the activities they allegedly undertook so that the Government can send its observations in this regard.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the persistent refusal of public authorities to bargain collectively in the oil, electricity and national university sectors, among others, the Committee noted in its previous examination of the case that the Government reported the conclusion of collective agreements in these sectors and invited the complainant organization to indicate whether in these collective bargaining processes the collective bargaining rights of its affiliates had been respected. The Committee reiterates this recommendation.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expresses its grave concern about the serious allegations of murders of workers and union officials, which it deeply regrets, and urges the Government to act diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases fully.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran), the Committee requests the Government to intensify the judicial proceedings and investigations of the Office of the Attorney-General in order to identify and severely punish the perpetrators, instigators and accomplices. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the developments of the proceedings and expects that they will yield",1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
79,"results in the near future.(c) Concerning the allegations in relation to the contract killings of more than  workers and union officials in the construction sector, the Committee requests the trade union to provide the Government without delay with a list of these murders and the circumstances thereof so that the Government can undertake the appropriate investigations without delay.(d) As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney-General s preparation of criminal charges against and detention of six workers at PDVSA because, during a protest in defence of their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities, the Committee requests the Government or competent authorities to take the necessary measures to have the criminal proceedings brought against the six union officials at PDVSA dropped and to ensure their release without delay. The Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term and so that in no event may criminal sanctions be imposed in cases of peaceful strikes. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts to the legal aspects of this case.(e) With respect to the allegations concerning the criminalization of protests, the initiation of judicial proceedings at various enterprises in the oil, gas and steel sectors, and the dismissal of union officials as a result of these protests (according to the CTV, judicial proceedings were started against  workers at the state holding PDVSA,  workers at the  Alfredo Maneiro' Orinoco steelworks for staging a protest in defence of their labour rights and ten trade union delegates of the  El Palito' refinery were dismissed after  workers decided to stop work as a result of failure to abide by commitments under the collective agreement. According to the CTV, workers at the enterprises Gas PetroPiar and Gas Comunal have also been affected), the Committee again requests the complainant to send the text of the accusations allegedly made against the union members in question.(f) With regard to the criminal court proceedings against  workers for claiming their rights, the Committee again requests the complainant organization to supply additional information concerning these allegations, specifically, the names of those involved and the activities they are alleged to have undertaken, so that the Government can send its observations in this regard.(g) The Committee again invites the complainant organization to indicate whether the collective bargaining rights of its affiliates have been respected in the bargaining processes mentioned by the Government.(h) The Committee calls the Governing Body s attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.
.The present complaint is contained in communications from the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) of  June and  November .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October  and  and  March .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  June and  November , the CTV alleges that the Office of the Attorney General has brought charges against six workers (Mr Larry Antonio Pedroza, a union delegate, Mr Jos Antonio Tovar, Mr Juan Ramn Aparicio, Mr Jafet Enrique Castillo Surez, Mr Roy Rogelio Chaparro Hernndez and Mr Jos Luis Hernndez Alvarado) of the enterprise Petrleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) Gas Comunal for committing the offence of boycotting, as provided for in section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services, simply for staging protests to demand their labour rights. As a result, provisional measures were ordered against the workers, who had to appear before the Second Oversight Tribunal of the state of Miranda. In this regard, the CTV states that, according to the Unitary Federation of Venezuelan Petroleum, Gas, Derivatives and Similar Workers (FUTPV), the Office of the Attorney General is being used against workers as a means of criminalizing protest.
.In this regard, the CTV adds that criminalization of protests has also occurred at various enterprises and legal proceedings have been initiated at the state holding PDVSA (affecting  workers) and the  Alfredo Maneiro' Orinoco steelworks (affecting  workers), at the gas enterprise PetroPiar and the El Palito refinery (at the latter,  workers decided to stop work because of failure to abide by commitments set out in the collective agreement, which resulted in the dismissal of ten union delegates) and Gas Comunal. Legal proceedings are currently before the courts in respect of  workers, mostly union officials. The CTV also states that around  workers have been taken to court for labour protests, which criminalizes the right to strike and the right to collective bargaining. According to the complainant, the security forces have been ordered to obstruct and suppress any protests.
.The complainant also alleges the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos district in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran).
.Furthermore, the union alleges that the construction sector has seen contract killings of workers and union officials (more than  victims among workers and officials) in an atmosphere of complete impunity.
.Lastly, the complainant mentions persistent refusal by the public authorities to bargain collectively in the health, oil, electricity and national university sectors, among others.
.In its communications of  October  and  and  March , the Government states, with regard to the charges brought against six workers at PDVSA for alleged boycotting, that, on  June , a demonstration was held by a group of workers of the enterprise PDVSA Gas which paralysed the plant s gas canister filling activities, affecting the sale of a commodity of prime necessity for the population. As a result, the following were arrested: Mr Larry Antonio Pedroza, Mr Jos Antonio Tovar, Mr Juan Ramn Aparicio Martnez, Mr Jaffet Enrique Castillo Surez, Mr Rogelio Chaparro Hernndez and Mr Jos Luis Hernndez Alvarado. These State enterprise workers appeared at a preliminary hearing before the Second Court of First Instance, acting as overseeing court for the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the state of Miranda, on  June . At the preliminary hearing (under flagrante delicto procedures) of the above individuals, the th Prosecutor of the Office of the Public Prosecutor qualified the events as a boycott, as provided for and penalized by section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services (which does not apply to peaceful demonstrations):Anyone who, jointly or individually, plans or carries out an action or is responsible for an omission that directly or indirectly impedes the production, manufacture, importation, warehousing, transport, distribution or sales of commodities classified as being of prime necessity shall be liable to a prison term of between six () and ten () years.
.The Government states that the prosecutor also requested that the proceedings continue in accordance with ordinary procedures, and that preventive detention be ordered. The preliminary hearing before the Second Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the State of Miranda was scheduled on  March . With reference to the accusation by the FUTPV concerning the national Government s use of the Office of the Attorney General to act against workers who have staged protests, the Government clarifies that the organization of the Venezuelan State into five branches of authority and the autonomous and interdependent functioning of each of them, together with the fact that the Office of the Attorney General is part of the civic authority, means that there are no mechanisms authorizing or endorsing Government interference in actions that other state authorities may choose to carry out. The Government underlines the fact that the actions of the Venezuelan State in relation to the acts committed by the workers in question were undertaken in strict compliance with current legislation and with respect for the workers' human rights, bearing in mind at the same time that the measures taken were appropriate to the nature of the events that took place, which went beyond a simple protest to demand labour rights, as the CTV presents them. The Government adds that the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services was published in the Official Bulletin of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela No. , of  April . It seeks to defend, protect and safeguard the individual and collective rights and interests of people in accessing goods and services for the purpose of meeting their needs and securing social peace, justice and the right to life and health of the",1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
80,"population.
.With regard to the alleged criminalization of protests staged by workers at PDVSA and the  Alfredo Maneiro' Orinoco steelworks, and to the legal proceedings brought against workers at the state holding company PDVSA, the Government states that the Office of the Public Prosecutor, as the competent body to examine this type of accusation, has received no complaints and, consequently, has not begun any investigations relating to the alleged criminalization of protests held by workers at PDVSA and the  Alfredo Maneiro' Orinoco steelworks. On the contrary, the national Government, through the Office of the Public Prosecutor, has intervened in various labour disputes that have arisen at the headquarters of PDVSA and its subsidiary enterprises located in five states across the country, assisting in resolving them, through mediation, without hearing of the practice of detention in any of the disputes, nor of criminal proceedings being brought against workers, on the understanding that in these cases the demonstrations did not lead to the commission of offences under Venezuelan legislation.
.Concerning the allegations concerning the accusation that  workers have been brought before the national courts for claiming their labour rights, which criminalizes the right to strike and the right to collective bargaining, the Venezuelan Government requires more precise information on either the workers allegedly involved or the courts examining the proceedings in order to be able to respond properly on this issue.
.With respect to the allegations concerning failure by a contracting enterprise of PDVSA at the El Palito refinery to comply with a collective agreement, the Government states that, as the failure mentioned by the CTV was on the part of a contractor providing services to the state enterprise PDVSA at the El Palito refinery, it is consequently not a matter of any action or omission by the Venezuelan State that adversely affects the rights of these workers. However, in the event of failure to guarantee their rights and comply with labour standards, the workers may complain to the competent authority, in this case the labour inspectorate, and initiate the proceedings set out in the Organic Labour Act, specifically with reference to submitting petitions, a procedure developed for taking action on working conditions, negotiating a collective agreement or ensuring that commitments made are fulfilled (sections '  of the Organic Labour Act).
.Relating to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in the town of El Tigre, Anzotegui state, the Government states that the Office of the nd Prosecutor of the Office of the Public Prosecutor (a national body with full competence), located in the city of Puerto la Cruz, Anzotegui state, is undertaking the investigation into this case, and is currently awaiting the results of various requests made to, and actions to be taken by, the Scientific, Criminal and Criminological Investigation Force, and that it will keep the Committee informed of progress and results in the case. As regards the allegations concerning crimes against union officials in the Los Anaucos district of Miranda state, the Government reports that these events were being investigated by the Office of the Ninth Prosecutor of the Office of the Public Prosecutor in the Los Anaucos district of Miranda state, which has instructed the Scientific, Criminal and Criminological Investigation Force to take all useful and necessary steps to establish the facts and identify the circumstances and perpetrators involved. The Government adds that the Office of the Public Prosecutor requested on  November  the closing of the case due to the decease of the accused persons, Mr Pedro Guillermo Rondn and Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avilez, in conformity with section () and in line with section () of the Organic Code of Penal Proceedings, for reasons of termination of criminal proceedings.
.In its communications dated  and  March , the Government indicates that, as regards the collective agreement for the electricity sector, the Federation of Workers in the Electric Industry (FETRAELEC) has negotiated a collective agreement with the National Electric Corporation (CORPOELEC), which was endorsed on  February , providing protection to , workers in that sector. Concerning the collective agreement of the Central University of Venezuela, the Labour Accord for the employees and workers in superior education was signed on  April  between the Union Federation of University Workers of Venezuela (FETRAUVE) and the National Federation of University Worker of Venezuela (FENASTRAUV), on the one hand, and the People s Ministry for Superior Education, on the other hand, providing protection to more than , employees and over , workers in that sector. With respect to the collective agreement for the petrol sector, a collective agreement was signed on  February  between the United Federation of Gas, Oil, Derivatives and Annexes of Venezuela (FUTPV) and PDVSA Gas SA and PDVSA Petrol SA, and deposited with the Directorate of the National Inspectorate for the Public Sector of the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The collective agreement provides protection to over , workers in the sector. In relation to the Labour Accord for the health sector, the National Federation of Regional, Sectoral and Related Unions of Workers in the Health Sector (FENASITRASALUD) has negotiated and deposited with the Directorate of the National Inspectorate for the Public Sector of the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security the Labour Accord for Employees and Workers in the Health Sector. In this regard, the national executive authority is currently waiting for the executive committee of the FENASITRASALUD recovers its legitimacy to be able to proceed with the endorsement of the aforementioned Labour Accord, which contains the most favourable economic and social benefits established in previous collective agreements for workers and employees of the health sector.
.The Committee notes that, in its allegations, the CTV alleges: () the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos district in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran); () the contract killings of more than  workers and union officials in the construction sector; () that the Office of the Attorney General has brought charges of boycotting against six workers (Mr Larry Antonio Pedroza, a union delegate, Mr Jos Antonio Tovar, Mr Juan Ramn Aparicio, Mr Jafet Enrique Castillo Surez, Mr Roy Rogelio Chaparro Hernndez and Mr Jos Luis Hernndez Alvarado) at PDVSA for staging protests to demand their labour rights; () the criminalization of protests, and initiation of legal proceedings at various enterprises and dismissal of union officials as a result of those protests; and () persistent refusal by the public authorities to bargain collectively in the health, oil, electricity and national university sectors, among others.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran), the Committee notes from the Government s report that: () investigations into the events have been pursued by the Office of the nd Prosecutor of the Office of the Public Prosecutor (a national body with full competence), of Anzotegui state, and the Office of the Ninth Prosecutor of the Office of the Public Prosecutor in the Los Anaucos district of Miranda state, respectively; and () the Office of the Public Prosecutor requested on  November  the closing of the case due to the decease of the accused persons, Mr Pedro Guillermo Rondn and Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avilez, in conformity with section () and in line with section () of the Organic Code of Penal Proceedings, for reasons of termination of criminal proceedings. The Committee deeply regrets the murders and recalls that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to explain the reasons why the criminal proceedings have been terminated, and expects that new investigations will be initiated and will yield results in the near future and will enable the perpetrators to be identified and punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcomes of the investigations.
.Concerning the allegations in relation to the contract killings of more than  workers and union officials in the construction sector, the Committee requests the trade union to provide the Government without delay with a list of these murders and the circumstances involved so that the Government can undertake the",0,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
81,"appropriate investigations without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In general, the Committee must express its grave concern at the serious allegations of murders of workers and union officials, and, in this regard, it urges the Government to act diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases fully.
.As regards the allegations concerning the Office of the Attorney General s filing of criminal charges for the offence of boycotting and the subsequent detention of six workers of the PDVSA enterprise because, during a protest to demand their labour rights, they paralysed the enterprise s activities (according to the FUTPV, the Office of the Attorney General is being used by the Government), the Committee notes the Government s statement that, on  June , a group of workers, as part of a demonstration, paralysed the plant s gas canister filling activities, affecting the sale of a commodity of prime necessity, for which they were arrested. On  June , the Second Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the state of Miranda summoned them to appear at a hearing, during which the th Prosecutor qualified the events as a boycott under section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services, which states:  Anyone who, jointly or individually, plans or carries out an action or is responsible for an omission that directly or indirectly impedes the production, manufacture, importation, warehousing, transport, distribution or sales of commodities classified as being of prime necessity shall be liable to a prison term of between six and ten years.' The Committee also notes the Government s statement that the Venezuelan State is organized into five branches of authority that function autonomously and interdependently and that there are no mechanisms authorizing interference by the Government in the other branches of state authority. It further notes the Government s indication that section  of the aforementioned Act does not apply to the right to peaceful assembly, and that the judicial authority has scheduled the preliminary hearing on  March .
.In this regard, the Committee underlines the fact that the activity of filling and selling gas canisters does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term (i.e. services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population), where the exercise of the right to strike or the paralysis of activities can be prohibited or restricted. The Committee also considers that the peaceful exercise of trade union rights should not be the subject of criminal proceedings or result in the detention of the union officials who have organized them, on charges of boycotting, as in the present case, by virtue of the application of section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services. This being the case, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to discontinue the criminal proceedings brought against the six union officials at PDVSA and to ensure their release without delay. The Committee also requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend section  of the Act for the Defence of Persons in Accessing Goods and Services so that it does not apply to services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term, and so that in no event criminal sanctions be imposed in cases of peaceful strikes. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee draws this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.With respect to the allegations concerning the criminalization of protests and initiation of legal proceedings at various enterprises in the oil, gas and steel sectors, and the dismissal of union officials as a result of these protests, the Committee notes that, according to the CTV, judicial proceedings have been initiated against  workers at the state holding PDVSA and  workers at the  Alfredo Maneiro' Orinoco steelworks for staging protests in defence of their labour rights, and that ten union delegates were dismissed at the El Palito refinery after  workers decided to stop work as a result of failure to abide by commitments under the collective agreement; workers at the enterprises Gas PetroPiar and Gas Comunal have also been affected. The Committee also notes the CTV s allegations that around  workers have been taken to court for claiming their labour rights. In this regard, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the Office of the Public Prosecutor has received no complaints and has not carried out any investigations concerning these allegations; on the contrary, the Office of the Public Prosecutor has intervened in various labour disputes at PDVSA, assisting in resolving them through mediation, without learning of any detentions or criminal proceedings in any of the disputes. Given the contradiction between the allegations and the Government s reply, the Committee requests the complainant to send the text of the accusations allegedly made against the union members in question.
.Relating to the criminal proceedings against  workers for claiming their rights, the Committee notes the Government s statement that more precise information should be provided. The Committee requests the complainant organization to supply supplementary information concerning these allegations, specifically, the names of those involved and the activities they are alleged to have undertaken, so that the Government can send its observations in this regard.
.As regards the allegations concerning persistent refusal by the public authorities to bargain collectively in the health, oil, electricity and national university sectors, among others, the Committee notes that the Government reports the conclusion of collective agreements in these sectors (the allegations relating to the health sector are dealt with in Case No. ). The Committee invites the complainant organization to indicate whether the collective bargaining rights of its affiliates have been respected in the bargaining processes mentioned by the Government.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expresses its grave concern at the serious allegations of murders of workers and union officials and urges the Government to act diligently and swiftly to resolve these cases fully.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the murder of three officials of the Bolivarian Union of Workers in the Construction Industry in El Tigre (Mr Wilfredo Rafael Hernndez Avile, general secretary, Mr Jess Argenis Guevara, organizational secretary, and Mr Jess Alberto Hernndez, culture and sports secretary) and of two trade union delegates in the Los Anaucos area in June  (Mr Felipe Alejandro Matar Iriarte and Mr Reinaldo Jos Hernndez Berroteran), the Committee requests the Government to explain the reasons for the termination of the criminal proceedings and expects that new investigations will be initiated and will yield results in the near future and will enable the perpetrators to be identified and punished.

83,".In its previous examination of the case at its June  meeting the Committee made the following recommendation, among others, on issues that remained pending [see the th Report, para. ]:' Considering that the intervention of the CNE in the elections of the executive board of the complainant trade union seriously violates Convention No. , the Committee must again urge the Government to exclude any intervention by the CNE in these elections, to substantially amend or repeal the rules relating to the CNE in trade union elections, to respect the elections of the complainant trade union and to refrain from invoking alleged irregularities or appeals to prevent it from bargaining collectively. The Committee requests the Government to take steps to amend the legislation to prevent this type of interference and to keep it informed in this regard ' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In its communication of  February , the Government states with regard to the election of the National Press Trade Union (SNTP) that on  December , the union held free and democratic elections in full accordance with the inalienable constitutional right, and that there was absolutely no interference by any authority of the Venezuelan State.
.The Committee notes this information with interest.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the National Press Trade Union (SNTP) dated  May . This organization submitted additional information and new allegations in communications dated  July and  September .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October  and  March .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Considering that the Government has not sufficiently respected the rights of demonstration on May Day and regretting the acts of violence which occurred, the Committee requests the Government in future to respect the principles mentioned in the conclusions and to endeavour to reach agreement with workers' organizations on the authorized route for demonstrations.(b) Considering that the intervention of the CNE in the elections of the executive board of the complainant trade union seriously violates Convention No. , the Committee must again urge the Government to exclude any intervention by the CNE in these elections, to substantially amend or repeal the rules relating to the CNE in trade union elections, to respect the elections of the complainant trade union and to refrain from invoking alleged irregularities or appeals to prevent it from bargaining collectively. The Committee requests the Government to take steps to amend the legislation to prevent this type of interference and to keep it informed in this regard.(c) Lastly, as regards the claim of the CNE to obtain lists of members of trade unions who elect the executive board, the Committee draws to the attention of the Government that the establishment of a register containing data on trade union members does not respect rights of the person (including privacy rights) and such a register may be used to compile blacklists of workers.",1,2009,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
84,".In its previous examination of the case in June , the Committee made the following recommendations on matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government to guarantee in writing that FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD can hold executive committee elections without any involvement by the National Electoral Council, including with regard to resources, as it is not a judicial body and does not enjoy the confidence of a large number of trade union organizations in the country. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD executive committee elections will take place without delay and that, in the future, the authorities will engage in collective bargaining with these organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government reiterates its previous information regarding the electoral default of the executive committee of the federations in question, which precludes them from collective bargaining.
.The Government adds that, in a communication of  May , the members of the executive committee of FETRASALUD informed the electoral authorities of a decision to hold an election of the executive committee of that federation. However, at a later date the interested parties indicated that they would not continue that electoral process as they were introducing an amendment to the statutes. Then, on  August , they indicated that the federation s electoral process would be held in  and to that end they submitted the text of the new internal statutes of FETRASALUD; however, they were notified that certain documents were missing and to this date the interested parties have not appeared again before the corresponding authorities. Therefore, the Government again reiterates that it is not a question of refusal by the corresponding authorities or the national Government itself to enter into dialogue or collective bargaining with those trade union organizations, but of compliance and enforcement of the legal regulations in this regard and the faithful implementation of ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the Government to provide FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD with written guarantees that they can hold their elections without any intervention by the National Electoral Council with a view to their being able to bargain collectively.

There is no indication in the federation s records that any new elections have been held since that date.
.On  February , FEDEUNEP submitted a draft collective bargaining agreement, on which the Directorate of the National Inspectorate for the Public Sector of the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security made some observations to which the trade union was to respond within  days, in line with the relevant legislative provisions. However, the trade union did not rectify the issues stipulated in the observations made by the abovementioned directorate, leading to the suspension of discussions relating to the draft collective bargaining agreement, in line with the principle of a prescriptive time limit on legal acts, as the trade union had failed to rectify any errors or omissions within the
.With regard to FETRASALUD, the Government informs the Committee that elections were last held on  September , when an executive committee was elected for afive-year term which expired on  September , in accordance with the provisions of article  of the trade union s own statutes. The Government wishes to point out that FETRASALUD submitted a draft collective agreement on  September , to be discussed with the Ministry of People s Power for Health, the National Institute of Nutrition (INN), the Autonomous Institute of Caracas University Hospital, the Dr Rafael Rangel National Institute of Hygiene, the Venezuelan Social Security Institute (IVSS), the Ministry of Education Staff Pensions and Welfare Institute (IPASME), and the National Social Insurance Institute (INASS). Negotiations relating to the abovementioned draft collective agreement were suspended on  October  because the executive committee lacked the authority to engage in collective bargaining, or discuss collective agreements, on behalf of the workers. Therefore, the Government states that there has been no refusal on the part of the Government to initiate collective bargaining with this trade union organization; it is a matter of strict compliance with the relevant legislation in the field and efforts to safeguard workers' representation in that sector, and all other sectors in the country.
.With regard to the allegations relating to FETRAFALCON, FETRAMERIDA and FETRAMIRANDA, the Committee notes with regret that, despite the request issued in November , the complainant organization has not provided the requested information. Under such circumstances, the Committee informs these organizations that if they fail to submit the relevant information in time for its next meeting, the Committee will no longer pursue its examination of the issues and allegations which remain pending.
.By way of clarification, the Committee reiterates its previous conclusions relating to these allegations [see th Report, paras ' ]:' As regards the Committee s recommendation regarding payment to the FETRAFALCON federation for the expropriated building using the amicable settlement mechanism and more generally regarding settlement of Falcn State s debts to the federation, the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that the representatives of FETRAFALCON already received the payment corresponding to the sale registration and the payment for the land. The Committee notes the Government s statement, however, that FETRAFALCON has given no evidence of being the owner of the outbuildings and that, consequently, according to the law, the Falcn State executive cannot make the payment relating to the outbuildings until FETRAFALCON proves that it owns them. The Committee requests the complainant organization to send its comments and provide further information in this respect.' As regards the allegation relating to the occupation of the FETRAMERIDA federation premises (in which it is claimed that a group of people linked to the Government seized the federation headquarters and since then has continued to occupy them, preventing the legitimate tenants from making use of the premises), the Committee observes that the complainant organization has not provided the additional information requested. The Committee notes the Government s additional observations to the effect that the former FETRAMERIDA headquarters building is currently being used by a group from the Bolivarian University of Venezuela and consequently the allegation that a group of people linked to the Government seized the FETRAMERIDA headquarters is false. The Committee again requests the complainant to provide further details in relation to the allegations.' As regards the allegations concerning the seizure by court order in  of the FETRAMIRANDA federation headquarters at the request of the regional government, the eviction of the trade unions from the premises and the subsequent occupation by Government supporters, the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () the seizure order was issued by the court because the federation in question failed to present any deed of ownership; and () there is no indication that this property of the Venezuelan State is being  occupied by Government supporters'  The Committee recalls that in its recommendation regarding this allegation it asked the Government to remove the occupiers and to guarantee FETRAMIRANDA s use of the premises until the dispute regarding ownership of the property is resolved. The Committee invites the complainant to send its comments on the Government s new reply and on the current status of the building in which its headquarters were located.
.With regard to the Committee s recommendation requesting the Government once again to engage in collective bargaining with FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD or to allow them to participate in bargaining in their respective sectors, the Committee notes the Government s statements which indicate that:",1,2008,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
85,"() the refusal to negotiate with FEDEUNEP is due to the trade union s failure to take on board the observations of the Ministry of People s Power for Labour and Social Security and the fact that it is in  electoral default'  and () the refusal to engage in collective bargaining with FETRASALUD also stems from the fact that its executive committee is in electoral default (failure to elect the executive committee before the end of its term of office), as its mandate has expired years ago, and thus, under existing legislative provisions, does not have the authority to engage in collective bargaining.
.The Committee wishes to refer to its previous conclusions [see th Report, para. ]:With regard to the alleged refusal by the authorities to negotiate with FEDEUNEP on a draft framework agreement to regulate working conditions in the public sector, and the authorities' alleged refusal to let FETRASALUD participate in collective bargaining in its sector since , the Committee regrets to observe that the Government justifies its refusal on the grounds that both federations have been in  electoral default' since  because they have not provided evidence of executive committee elections since that year. The Committee wishes to point out, in this regard, that it has repeatedly criticized the intervention of the National Electoral Council (which is not a judicial body) in elections to trade union executive committees.In various earlier cases, the Committee has observed how this body and its activities have stymied the results of trade union elections until lengthy procedures with uncertain outcomes have been resolved, and that this type of intervention has had a negative impact on organizations belonging to the CTV; it is therefore not surprising that these union organizations disown the electoral system guided by the National Electoral Council, which has itself been the subject of many objections, not only from the Committee on Freedom of Association, but also from the Committee of Experts and the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards, for its violations of Article  of Convention No. . In particular, the Committee would like to refer to the conclusions of the Committee on the Application of Standards in its June  discussion of the application of Convention No. , in which it urged the Government to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that intervention of the National Electoral Council in proceedings of union elections, including its intervention in cases of complaints, was only possible when the organization explicitly so requested, and to take active steps to amend all the legislative provisions incompatible with the Convention to which the Committee of Experts had objected. The Committee on the Application of Standards also requested the Government to intensify social dialogue with representative organizations of workers and employers. This being the case, and bearing in mind that the federations within the CTV unite numerous organizations and thousands of workers, the Committee requests the Government to bargain with FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD or to allow them to participate in bargaining in their respective sectors, and to report to it in this regard.
.Mindful of the fact that the draft collective agreements were submitted by these organizations a number of years ago and may no longer be valid, the Committee requests the Government to provide FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD with written guarantees that they will be able to hold elections without any intervention by the National Electoral Council, including with regard to resources, as it is not a judicial body and does not enjoy the confidence of a large number of trade union organizations in the country. The Committee expects that the FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD executive committee elections will take place without delay and that, in the future, the authorities will engage in collective bargaining with these organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to guarantee in writing that FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD can hold executive committee elections without any involvement by the National Electoral Council, including with regard to resources, as it is not a judicial body and does not enjoy the confidence of a large number of trade union organizations in the country. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD executive committee elections will take place without delay and that, in the future, the authorities will engage in collective bargaining with these organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee informs the complainant organization that it will not proceed with the examination of the allegations relating to FETRAFALCON, FETRAMERIDA and FETRAMIRANDA unless they submit the relevant information in time for the next meeting of the Committee.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  May .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee again requests the Government to engage in collective bargaining with FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD or to allow them to participate in bargaining in their respective sectors, and to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee invites the complainant organization to send comments and further information regarding the allegations relating to the status of the FETRAFALCON and FETRAMERIDA premises, taking particular account of the Government s latest reply.(c) The Committee invites the complainant organization to send its comments on:
.The complaint is contained in communications from the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) of  July . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  March and  May  and  March .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  July , the CTV alleges that the Government has refused to negotiate collective agreements in various branches of the public sector.
.The Venezuelan Teachers' Federation (FVM) submitted a draft collective agreement to the Ministry of Labour on  March , to be negotiated with the Ministry of Education. This agreement provides protection for more than , educators, but it has not yet been possible to begin negotiations as the Ministry of Labour has not issued the necessary convocation.
.In addition, the collective agreement for workers in the national public administration expired in . The National Federation of Public Employees (FEDEUNEP) submitted its last draft in February , but negotiations have not yet begun because the Ministry of Labour refuses to issue the necessary convocation.
.The Federation of Health Workers (FETRASALUD) has been denied the right to participate in collective bargaining in its sector since .
.The above trade unions belong to the CTV. They have all been denied the right to negotiate collective labour agreements, with negative consequences for thousands of state workers. The national Government, in outright violation of the ILO s Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), is denying these trade unions any interlocution and attempting to fix working conditions unilaterally.
.Furthermore, the CTV alleges that, on  May , the house that serves as headquarters for the Falcn State Federation of Workers (FETRAFALCON) was forcibly expropriated by the regional government. At the time when this occurred,  unions belonged to the organization, altogether representing some , workers. The organization was made to accept an indemnity payment, although this has not yet been paid in full.
.In addition, on  April , a group of people linked to the national Government seized the headquarters of the Mrida State Federation of Workers (FETRAMERIDA), and since then, with Government support, has continued to occupy it, preventing its legitimate users from utilizing it. At the time when this occurred,  unions belonged to the organization, altogether representing more than , workers.
.The CTV adds that, on  March , the building that served as headquarters for the Miranda State Federation of Workers (FETRAMIRANDA) was seized by court order, at the instigation of the regional government, and then, on  March , the unions were evicted from their offices, which were  taken' by government supporters belonging to official units known as  missions'  FETRAMIRANDA brings together  unions that occupy premises in the Federation building.
.On  October , the offices of the Trujillo State Federation of Workers (FETRATRUJILLO) were subjected to an eviction order, issued by a judge, at the instigation of the national Government. Some  unions, representing more than , workers, pursued their daily activities at these offices. This was an unconstitutional judicial seizure, with an acting judge entirely abusing",1,2008,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
86,"his authority and with support from the security forces, pickets, national guard and national police in this invalid and illegal act committed by an acting judge, despite requests to prevent it and appeals to the appropriate legal authorities. The buildings are currently in a considerable state of disrepair.
.The Unified Federation of Workers of the Federal District (FUTDF) and the Carabobo State Federation of Workers (FETRACARABOBO), the largest regional organizations in the country, have also been evicted from their offices.
.All the above union organizations are CTV members and there can be no doubt that the object of these arbitrary measures, some by the national Government and others by the relevant regional governors, is to destroy the CTV.
.According to the allegations, the incidents described are severely damaging to the principles of freedom of association enshrined in Convention No.  and demonstrate once more that the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has repeatedly violated this Convention and is failing to respect the commitments it has assumed before the ILO.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states, with respect to the allegation concerning the FVM, that meetings are currently being held under the auspices of the public sector labour inspectorate to discuss the draft collective labour agreement submitted by the Federation on  May . The collective labour agreement under discussion covers some , educators and comprises  clauses, of which  have already been approved at meetings held at the labour inspectorate with the participation of the FVM and the Ministry of Education. Negotiations have been conducted in a peaceful atmosphere, highlighting the will of the Venezuelan Government, through the labour administration, to fulfil its functions as mediator and facilitator.
.With regard to the allegations made by FEDEUNEP, according to which it submitted a draft framework agreement to regulate working conditions in the public sector on  February , the Government states that the Federation last held elections on  October , meaning that the term of its executive committee ran from  to , in accordance with the provisions of section  of its own statutes. Its term expired on  October , and the Federation s executive committee is therefore in electoral delinquency.
.In this regard, the Government continues, the Federation was informed on  June , through the National Labour Inspectorate, of the need to resolve the situation of electoral default in order to negotiate the draft framework agreement, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Organic Labour Act. To date, according to information received from the competent administrative authority, FEDEUNEP has not submitted evidence that it has rectified the electoral default of the members of its executive committee.
.For additional information, there follows a transcript of the content of section  of the Organic Labour Act Regulations, which stipulates that the members of trade union executive committees whose term has expired may not organize, undertake or represent the union in procedures other than the purely administrative, as follows:Section . Trade union elections. Expired term: Trade union organizations are entitled to hold their own elections, with no restrictions other than those established in their statutes and in law. Members of trade union executive bodies whose elected term has expired, in accordance with the provisions of sections  and  of the Organic Labour Act and their union statutes, shall not organize, undertake or represent the union in legal procedures other than the purely administrative.
.From this, it can be seen that FEDEUNEP is not in a position to negotiate the draft framework agreement submitted, as the term for which the members of its executive committee were elected has expired and the organization has not provided evidence to show that it has held further elections to rectify the situation. Once the situation has been resolved, negotiations can proceed on the draft collective labour agreement, in accordance with labour standards and in full compliance with ILO Convention No. .
.With regard to FETRASALUD, the Government reports that this organization s status is the same as in the two previous cases, i.e. its executive committee is also in electoral default as, since  September  (when its last executive committee elections were held), no evidence has been presented to show that new elections have taken place.
.The Government underlines that all the above categorically demonstrates that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has not denied any of the trade union organizations named their right to collective bargaining, much less acted in a manner detrimental to workers. The accusations of the CTV lack any basis at all, as the fact that discussion of the draft collective agreements has not begun is not attributable to the Venezuelan Government but to failure by the union organizations in question to observe legal requirements.
.Trade unions have full autonomy to conduct their elections, as this is a prerogative granted by section  of the Organic Electoral Authority Act, which states in this regard that the National Electoral Council must respect the autonomy and independence of trade unions by observing the relevant international treaties signed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and by providing them with appropriate technical and logistical support.
.With regard to the cases involving alleged forced expropriation of the Falcn State Federation of Workers on  May , alleged occupation of FETRAMERIDA s headquarters in the city of Mrida on  April , alleged occupation of FETRAMIRANDA s offices on  March , alleged eviction of FETRATRUJILLO in October , and alleged eviction of FETRACARABOBO, for which no date is given, the Government expresses great concern that these cases are presented without any foundation whatsoever; there are insufficient details to verify the information provided by the complainants. Nevertheless, with the greatest willingness to act in a spirit of cooperation, the Government states that every effort will be made to elucidate the truth of the matters raised. Likewise, the Government makes it very clear that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela maintains the separation and independence of public authorities, and states that the Committee will be informed promptly of the results of consultation between the bodies competent to resolve the situation, if the allegations are found to be true.
.More specifically, with regard to the alleged expropriation of FETRAFALCON on  May , the Government states that, on  December , FETRAFALCON, in accordance with a prior agreement to resolve the dispute through transaction, sold premises to the regional executive for the state of Falcn, adopting the amicable resolution mechanism provided for in the Act on expropriation for reasons of public utility, in order to comply with the procedure established in law and required by a decree of the Governor for the state of Falcn. This transaction is being processed and the regional executive for the state of Falcn has made the appropriate payments. However, in exercise of their rights, FETRAFALCON s representatives filed a claim before the Third Court of First Instance for Civil, Mercantile, Agrarian and Transport Matters against the Falcn regional executive for payment of the amount outstanding from the sale agreement to which they submitted. The claim was in turn transmitted to the Full Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice so that it could determine which tribunal was actually competent to examine the case; the entire procedure has been carried out in accordance with sections '  of the Code of Civil Procedure.
.With regard to the alleged occupation of FETRAMERIDA s offices in the city of Mrida on  April , the Government states that the CTV has not provided sufficient details to enable information on the allegations to be obtained.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the seizure of FETRAMIRANDA s offices on  March , the Government states that, on  March , the examining court transmitted to the Political and Administrative Chamber the request for seizure prepared by the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Miranda, under section . of the Code of Civil Procedure, in the case it was bringing against FETRAMIRANDA. In ruling No. , published on  June , the Chamber found the request for seizure to be admissible, and therefore ordered it to be carried out once  consecutive days had elapsed from the date on which official notification of the parties was recorded. On  February , the legal representative of the Office of the Public Prosecutor for the state of Miranda requested the seizure order approved by the Chamber to be carried out; the appropriate action was duly taken. On  March , the seizure ordered on  June by the Political and Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice in its ruling in the case brought by the Bolivarian state of Miranda against FETRAMIRANDA was carried out. In order to prevent this ' continues the Government ' FETRAMIRANDA lodged an objection, which was examined and ruled inadmissible; once this had been decided, the order was carried out. It is necessary to point out that the principal claim relates to title to the property, an issue which has not been resolved by the seizure and",0,2008,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
87,"can only be decided by a judgement of merit from the examining court.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the alleged eviction from FETRATRUJILLO s offices in October , the Government reports that, on  May , the Federation, in the person of its directors (Mr Argenis Carreo Marn, Mr Orlando de Jess Torres and Mr scar Orlando Rivas) brought before the Third Court of First Instance for Civil, Mercantile, Agrarian, Transport, Banking and Constitutional Matters of the Trujillo state jurisdiction proceedings to obtain protection of their premises against Mr Jos Santos Gil, Mr Antonio Zambrano, Mr Eleazar Buitrago, Mr Ramn Carrizo, Mr Jhonny Estrada and Mr Jorge Alexander Romero. In examining this case, the judge was required to establish certain facts and, on that basis, decide a posteriori whether FETRATRUJILLO had tangibly and effectively fulfilled the requirements of section  of the Venezuelan Civil Code in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is important to point out that the parameters for the decision taken in this case were and are clearly defined, namely: (a) to determine with absolute certainty whether the complainants are the legitimate possessors of the property at the centre of the dispute; (b) whether their possession has lasted more than a year and a day; and (c) whether the legitimate possession claimed by the complainants has been interrupted; fulfilment of these requirements is and was indispensable in order for the interdiction claim for protection of possession brought by FETRATRUJILLO to succeed.
.In their case, the complainants allege acts of violence, stating that:  ...twenty citizens proceeded to engage arbitrarily in a series of disorderly activities, such as knocking over gates and fences  ? This situation could not be verified, as the legal inspection requested by FETRATRUJILLO s representatives revealed that the fences and gates were fully erect, the main faade was in perfect condition and the gate at the main entrance was working properly, which showed that the  disorderly' events described by the complainants had not occurred and that their allegations were false.
.Furthermore, the Government states that the complainants have in no way demonstrated that the property is theirs, because such buildings simply are not the property of any individual, as they belong ipso jure to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, since they are part of the nation s heritage; they are the property of the nation, over which there is no prescription of rights over time, much less rights of possession, and over which the Venezuelan State has ownership and possession throughout time and space. National property does not lose these attributes over time or space.
.This case proceeded, as has been stated, in accordance with legally established procedure. During its examination, representatives of FETRATRUJILLO did not present or provide any document to show that any government agency had authorized them to remain on the premises. Based on this, on  February , the examining judge ordered the immediate reversion of the premises to state ownership, through the appropriate measures, and there was certainly no eviction procedure, as the complainants claim: rather, the legally established procedure was followed. The parties subsequently appealed this decision and the acting judge of the Higher Court for Civil, Mercantile and Transport Affairs and Minors of the Trujillo state jurisdiction rejected the appeal on  October , upholding the final ruling in the interdiction claim for possession that resolved to return the premises to state ownership.
.With regard to the alleged eviction of FETRACARABOBO, the Government states that the complainants attempted to bring proceedings for constitutional protection in respect of the alleged occupation of premises to which they claim title. In the face of these proceedings, the Carabobo State Government and the Valencia town hall provided documents granting right of title to the premises in question, in a reply that was transmitted to the examining court by the Public Prosecutor for Carabobo State. In addition, the content of the ruling verifies that there is no document granting property title for the premises in question to this trade union federation.
.In this case, the court examining the constitutional protection claim ruled that there had been ordinary proceedings of sufficient brevity and effectiveness to satisfy the plaintiff s claim, i.e. the restitution of property. It therefore ruled that the constitutional protection claim was inadmissible, as it fell within the criteria for inadmissibility set out in section . of the Organic Act on Protection for Rights and Constitutional Guarantees. Equally, it is important to note that it is well established in the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice that, in the case of eviction from or seizure of premises, the appropriate prompt, summary and effective ordinary process which the alleged injured parties should invoke is a possession interdiction. The Third Court of First Instance for Civil, Mercantile, Agrarian and Banking Affairs of the Carabobo state jurisdiction therefore ruled, on  April , that the above constitutional protection claim was inadmissible (rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice attached).
.Based on the above, the Government requests that these allegations be disregarded as they lack any substance or basis in fact, given that there has been no violation of the right to freedom of association or any other right enshrined in the country s domestic law or the international standards it has ratified. Every matter raised by the complainants concerns a procedure carried out with respect for the rights of the parties involved and observing due process, in full compliance with the relevant legal standards.
.In its communication of  March , the Government indicates that the premises that are being utilized by the workers' federations of the States of Miranda, Trujillo and Mrida are state property and thus as essential part of the territorial integrity of the State. Having an undeniable right to those premises, the State has started recuperating this property by making use of the protective function of public order, on the understanding that this notion embodies all those standards of public interest that require unconditional compliance, are not revocable by private demand and seek to make the general interest of society prevail over the private interest of the individual. It should be noted that such actions of the State could be considered a violation of international principles enshrining the exercise of freedom of association (ILO Convention No. ), although the State, by making use of the protective function of public order, has recuperated property, which was up to now in the hands of one single  stream' within the trade union movement; this situation having created up to now a situation of inequality as regards the rest of the trade union movement that could not benefit from the premises for its trade union activities. Thus, far from constituting the presently alleged violation of freedom of association, the State of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, invoking on the one hand its legitimate interests in favour of society and, on the other hand, the strengthening of the trade union movement, contributed to the elimination of hideous inequalities among workers' organizations existing in the country. It would be unfair if one single  stream' within the trade union movement benefited from the premises of the nation to the detriment of the rest. In keeping with the guidance contained in international human rights conventions and provided by the ILO supervisory bodies, the Government has therefore acted to avoid union discrimination or favouritism of one union stream over another.
.The Committee observes that in this case the CTV alleges refusal by the authorities to negotiate with public sector CTV trade unions, along with actions by the authorities to expropriate various member federations or deprive them of their premises.
.With regard to the authorities' refusal to negotiate with various public sector trade union federations belonging to the CTV, the Committee notes the Government s statements that meetings are being held under the auspices of the public sector labour inspectorate to discuss the draft collective agreement (which would cover some , educators) submitted on  May  by the FVM, with  out of  clauses approved so far. The Committee regrets the fact that, despite two years having elapsed since the draft collective agreement was submitted, bargaining has still not finished, and expresses the firm hope that the collective agreement will be signed in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the alleged refusal by the authorities to negotiate with FEDEUNEP on a draft framework agreement to regulate working conditions in the public sector, and the authorities' alleged refusal to let FETRASALUD participate in collective bargaining in its sector since , the Committee regrets to observe that the Government justifies its refusal on the grounds that both federations have been in  electoral default' since  because they have not provided evidence of executive committee elections since that year. The Committee wishes to point out, in this regard, that it has repeatedly criticized the intervention of the National Electoral Council",0,2008,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
88,"(which is not a judicial body) in elections to trade union executive committees.
.In various earlier cases, the Committee has observed how this body and its activities have stymied the results of trade union elections until lengthy procedures with uncertain outcomes have been resolved, and that this type of intervention has had a negative impact on organizations belonging to the CTV; it is therefore not surprising that these union organizations disown the electoral system guided by the National Electoral Council, which has itself been the subject of many objections, not only from the Committee on Freedom of Association, but also from the Committee of Experts and the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards, for its violations of Article  of Convention No. . In particular, the Committee would like to refer to the conclusions of the Committee on the Application of Standards in its June  discussion of the application of Convention No. , in which it urged the Government to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that intervention of the National Electoral Council in proceedings of union elections, including its intervention in cases of complaints, was only possible when the organization explicitly so requested, and to take active steps to amend all the legislative provisions incompatible with the Convention to which the Committee of Experts had objected. The Committee on the Application of Standards also requested the Government to intensify social dialogue with representative organizations of workers and employers. This being the case, and bearing in mind that the federations within the CTV unite numerous organizations and thousands of workers, the Committee requests the Government to bargain with FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD or to allow them to participate in bargaining in their respective sectors, and to report to it in this regard.
.With regard to the alleged forced expropriation by the Falcn state government of FETRAFALCON s offices, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () on  December , FETRAFALCON, in accordance with a prior agreement to resolve the dispute through transaction, sold premises to the regional executive for the state of Falcn, adopting the amicable resolution mechanism provided for in the Act on expropriation for reasons of public utility, in order to comply with the procedure established in law and required by a decree of the Governor for the state of Falcn; () this transaction is being processed and the regional executive for the state of Falcn has made the appropriate payments; () however, in exercise of their rights, FETRAFALCON s representatives filed a claim before the Third Court of First Instance for Civil, Mercantile, Agrarian and Transport Matters against the Falcn regional executive for payment of the amount outstanding from the sale agreement to which they submitted; () the claim was in turn transmitted to the Full Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice so that it could determine which tribunal was actually competent to examine the case; and () the entire procedure has been carried out in accordance with sections '  of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Committee concludes that the state of Falcn has still not paid FETRAFALCON the full amount for the premises expropriated for reasons of public utility through the amicable resolution mechanism. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the process under way and to urge the Falcn state executive to pay the debt it owes to FETRAFALCON.
.With regard to the allegation that, on  April , a group of people linked to the national Government seized the headquarters of FETRAMERIDA, and since then, with Government support, has continued to occupy it, preventing its legitimate users from utilizing it, the Committee notes that the Government requests further details in order to be able to obtain information on the alleged occupation. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has approached neither FETRAMERIDA nor the regional executive to obtain more details. The Committee invites the complainant to provide further information concerning its allegations and invites the Government to request information without delay from the regional authorities in the state of Mrida, so that the Committee can examine this allegation without delay. It also invites the Government to ensure that the occupation of trade union premises ceases.
.With regard to the allegation that, on  March , the building that served as headquarters for FETRAMIRANDA was seized by court order, at the instigation of the regional government (according to the complainant, on  March , the unions were evicted from their offices, which were  taken' by Government supporters belonging to official units known as  missions' , the Committee takes note of the Government s extensive statements, from which it emerges that: () the Political and Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court declared the request for seizure of the premises ' the headquarters of FETRAMIRANDA ' made by the Office of the Public Prosecutor for the state of Miranda admissible; and () the basic question of who holds title to the property has not been resolved. The Committee expresses its deep concern at the seizure, according to the Government under section . of the Code of Civil Procedure, without indication of the specific motive for its approval in the circumstances described. The Committee requests the Government to remove the persons occupying FETRAMIRANDA s headquarters (Government supporters, according to the CTV) and to guarantee FETRAMIRANDA s use of the premises until the claim over title to the property is resolved.
.With regard to the allegation that, on  October , the offices of FETRATRUJILLO were subjected to an unconstitutional seizure and eviction order, issued by a judge (who acted as both sentencer and executor), at the instigation of the national Government, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () since  May , members of FETRATRUJILLO have been pursuing, through the civil courts, a claim for constitutional protection of their possession against other individuals; () the judge had to determine whether the complainants were the legitimate possessors of the property at the centre of the dispute, whether their possession had lasted more than a year and a day, and whether the legitimate possession claimed by the complainants had been interrupted; () the complainants have in no way demonstrated that the property is theirs, because such buildings are simply not the property of any individual, as they belong ipso jure to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, since they are part of the nation s heritage; they are the property of the nation, over which there is no prescription of rights over time, much less rights of possession, and over which the Venezuelan State has ownership and possession throughout time and space; no damage to the property has been verified; () this case proceeded, in accordance with legally established procedure, and during its examination, representatives of FETRATRUJILLO did not present or provide any document to show that any government agency had authorized them to remain on the premises; () based on this, on  February , the examining judge ordered the immediate reversion of the premises to state ownership, through the appropriate measures, and there was certainly no eviction procedure, as the complainants claim: rather, the legally established procedure was followed; and () the parties subsequently appealed and the acting judge of the Higher Court for Civil, Mercantile and Transport Affairs and Minors of the Trujillo state jurisdiction rejected the appeal on  October , upholding the final ruling in the interdiction claim for possession that resolved to return the premises to state ownership.
.The Committee concludes that the judicial authorities have established that the property housing FETRATRUJILLO s headquarters belongs to the State and was returned to national ownership. The Committee regrets, however, that the regional authorities have not attempted to assist in finding a provisional or definitive solution to remedy the fact that, as a result, FETRATRUJILLO has been deprived of its trade union headquarters, which it had been using for years, particularly in view of the complainant s statement that the building is now falling into disrepair.
.With regard to the allegations that the FUTDF and FETRACARABOBO have also been evicted from their offices, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the complainants attempted to bring proceedings for constitutional protection in respect of the alleged occupation of premises to which they claim title; () in the face of these proceedings, the Carabobo State Government and the Valencia town hall provided documents granting right of title to the premises in question; () according to the ruling, there is no document granting property title for the premises in question to this trade union federation; () the judicial authority that examined the constitutional protection claim ruled that there had been ordinary proceedings of sufficient brevity and effectiveness to satisfy the plaintiff s claim (i.e. the restitution of property); it therefore ruled that the constitutional protection claim was inadmissible, as it fell within the criteria for inadmissibility set out in the Organic Act on Protection for Rights and Constitutional Guarantees; () it is",1,2008,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
89,"well established in the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice that, in the case of eviction from or seizure of premises, the appropriate prompt, summary and effective ordinary process which the alleged injured parties should invoke is a possession interdiction; and () in these circumstances, the Third Court of First Instance for Civil, Mercantile, Agrarian and Banking Affairs of the Carabobo state jurisdiction ruled, on  April , that the above constitutional protection claim was inadmissible.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the Carabobo State Government and the Valencia town hall provided documents granting their right of title to the premises housing FETRACARABOBO s offices and apparently the offices of the FUTDF. The Committee once more regrets that the authorities have not attempted to assist in finding a provisional or definitive solution to remedy the fact that, as a result, FETRACARABOBO and the FUTDF have been deprived of the union offices that they had been using for years.
.In general, the Committee can only highlight the fact that, in this and other cases, the CTV and its trade union federations have been the subject of actions or omissions by the authorities intended to harass or damage them, whether it be by refusing to bargain collectively with them, in some cases, or, in others, by depriving them of their offices after many years without exploring other alternatives. The Committee expresses its deep concern at the fact that the Government, in its most recent communication received shortly before the Committee s session, justifies the eviction of FETRATRUJILLO, FETRAMIRANDA and FETRAMERIDA from their headquarters by a presumed elimination of  hideous inequalities' among the existing workers' organizations.
.The Committee must underline the fact that the spirit of Convention No.  calls for impartial treatment of all trade union organizations by the authorities, even if they criticize the social or economic policies of national or regional executives, as well as avoidance of reprisals for pursuing legitimate trade union activities.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deplores the fact that, despite two years having elapsed since the submission of a draft collective agreement by the FVM, it has still not been concluded, and expresses the firm hope that the collective agreement will be signed in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to bargain with FEDEUNEP and FETRASALUD or to allow them to participate in bargaining in their respective sectors, and to report to it in this regard.(c) With regard to the allegation concerning the forced expropriation by the Falcn State Government of FETRAFALCON s offices, the Committee observes that the state of Falcn has still not paid FETRAFALCON the full amount for the premises expropriated for reasons of public utility through the amicable resolution mechanism and requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the process under way. The Committee also requests the Government to urge the Falcn state executive to pay the debt it owes to FETRAFALCON.(d) With regard to the allegation that, on  April , a group of people linked to the national Government seized the headquarters of FETRAMERIDA and, since then, with Government support, has continued to occupy it, preventing its legitimate users from utilizing it, the Committee notes that the Government requests further details in order to be able to obtain information on the alleged occupation. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has approached neither FETRAMERIDA nor the regional executive to obtain more details. The Committee invites the complainant to provide further information concerning its allegations and invites the Government to request information without delay from the regional authorities in the state of Mrida, so that the Committee can examine this allegation without delay. It also invites the Government to ensure that the occupation of trade union premises ceases.(e) With regard to the allegation in which the CTV adds that, on  March , the building that served as headquarters for FETRAMIRANDA was seized by court order, at the instigation of the regional government, and then, according to the complainant, on  March , the unions were evicted from their offices, which were  taken' by Government supporters belonging to official units known as  missions'  the Committee requests the Government to remove the occupiers (Government supporters, according to the CTV) and to guarantee FETRAMIRANDA s use of the premises until the claim over title to the property is resolved.(f) With regard to the allegation that, on  October , the offices of FETRATRUJILLO were subjected to an unconstitutional occupation and eviction order, issued by a judge (who acted as both sentencer and executor), at the instigation of the national Government, the Committee observes that the judicial authorities have established that the property housing FETRATRUJILLO s headquarters belongs to the State and was returned to national ownership. The Committee regrets, however, that the regional authorities have not attempted to assist in finding a provisional or definitive solution to remedy the fact that, as a result, FETRATRUJILLO has been deprived of its trade union headquarters, which it had been using for years.(g) With regard to the allegations that the FUTDF and FETRACARABOBO, which are among the largest regional organizations in the country, have also been evicted from their offices, the Committee once more regrets that the authorities have not attempted to assist in finding a provisional or definitive solution to remedy the fact that, as a result, FETRACARABOBO and the FUTDF have been deprived of the union offices that they had been using for years.(h) Observing that, as can be seen from this and previous cases, the CTV and its trade union federations have been the subject of actions or omissions by the authorities intended to harass or damage them, the Committee underlines the fact that the spirit of Convention No.  calls for impartial treatment of all trade union organizations by the authorities, even if they criticize the social or economic policies of national or regional executives, as well as avoidance of reprisals for pursuing legitimate trade union activities.",-1,2008,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
90,".In its previous examination of the case in June , the Committee made the following recommendations on the question still pending, which concerned the refusal by the authorities of the Ministry of Education and Sport to negotiate the draft Fifth Collective Labour Agreement with the eight national federations [see th Report, para. ]:Reminding the Government of the obligation to promote collective bargaining under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , the Committee requests it to take initiatives without delay to facilitate negotiation of the Fifth Collective Labour Agreement with the eight federations in the sector (education and sport).
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that it reiterates its previous statements (made in the previous examination of the case) in which it provided broad and detailed information on the procedure that must be followed for the presentation and subsequent negotiation of draft collective agreements. The Government emphasizes that the reply in question was based on labour laws in force, which guarantee the exercise of the right to legal defence and due process of law, these being the foundations of the democratic State, based on the rule of law and social rights in which workers can effectively carry on trade union activity in the private and collective spheres.
.The Committee wishes to recall that in its previous examination of the case, it pointed out to the Government that the requirement of excessive legal formalities in the context of broad bargaining processes (which in the present case involves eight federations) may be contrary to the principle of the promotion of collective bargaining set out in Article  of Convention No. . The Committee had regretted that the Ministry of Education and Sport did not extend the statutory time limit for the rectification of errors and omissions to which it refers [see th Report, para. ].
.Likewise, in its previous examination of the case, the Committee requested the Government to take initiatives without delay to facilitate negotiation of the Fifth Collective Labour Agreement with the eight federations in the sector. The Committee regrets that the Government confines itself to reiterating the statements it made in September , and that it has disregarded the Committee s recommendation to facilitate negotiation of the Fifth Collective Labour Agreement. The Committee urges the Government once again to take measures in this regard.
.The complaint is contained in communications of the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC) and the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) dated  May and  October , respectively.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , FLATEC and, in its communication of  October , CLAT allege that the Venezuelan Federation of Primary Teachers (FVM) has  organizations and that on  March , together with the other seven national federations of education workers in the Ministry of Education, submitted to the National Directorate of Inspection and Collective Labour Matters in the Public Sector the draft text of the Fifth Collective Labour Agreement for discussion with the Ministry.
.On  April , the national federations of education workers received decision No. -, approved by the Director of the National Directorate of Inspection and Collective Labour Matters in the Public Sector who, in accordance with section , final part, of the Organic Labour Act, made certain observations on the draft text of the Collective Labour Agreement referred to above and at the same time requested the inclusion of the clarifications and corrections considered to be necessary.
.Within the corresponding statutory time limits, in accordance with section  of the Organic Act on administrative procedures, corrections and modifications were made for each and every observation that the National Labour Inspectorate unjustly and illegally claimed to raise in relation to the Fifth Collective Labour Agreement to be discussed with the Ministry of Education.
.On  September , the eight national federations in the education sector were surprised by administrative decision No. -, of  August , issued by the Director of the National Directorate of Inspection and Collective Labour Matters in the Public Sector, indicating that this labour administration authority considered closed the procedure initiated on  March  relating to the discussion of the draft text of the Fifth Collective Labour Agreement referred to above.
.In accordance with section  of the Organic Labour Act, on  September  a hierarchical appeal was lodged with the Ministry of Labour against administrative decision No. -, of  August , of the Director of the National Directorate of Inspection and Collective Labour Matters in the Public Sector, which asserted that the FVM had not made in full or correctly the amendments and corrections arising out of the observations made by the Directorate, nor had they provided the supporting documentation required in accordance with section  of the Organic Labour Act, as a result of which the Directorate did not consider the amended version drawn up by the FVM to be valid and declared the procedure closed. The Directorate s assertion does not correspond to the facts.
.In accordance with ILO Convention No.  and the national legislation, the complainant organizations call for the full restitution of the right to collective bargaining, as the present collective agreement has been in force for too long without being renewed, thereby prejudicing the rights of , education workers in the service of the Ministry of Education and Sport and their respective organizations.
.In its communication of  September , the Government indicates that on  June , a collective labour agreement concluded between the union federations FENAPRODO, FETRAMAGISTERIO, FVM, FESLEV-CLEV, FEV, FETRASINED, FETRAENSEANZA, FENATEV and SINAFUN and the Ministry of Education and Sport was deposited with the National Directorate of Inspection and Collective Labour Matters in the Public Sector, and was approved by the National Directorate of Inspection in the Public Sector on the same date by decision No. -. In the context of this procedure, on  October , following the convocation of the parties, negotiation of the draft collective agreement was officially commenced at the premises of the Ministry with the presence, among other unions, of the representatives of the FVM.
.It should also be noted that on  May , the Office of the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, through Presidential Decree No. , approved a  per cent increase in the wage scale for the teaching personnel of the Ministry of Education and Sport, in light of the inter-union problems affecting and prejudicing the labour force. This clearly demonstrates that the alleged violation has not occurred, as the Government convened, established, discussed, approved and registered the Collective Labour Agreement for the Venezuelan primary teaching sector (in ) and subsequently granted by decree the wage increase referred to above. The teaching personnel of the Ministry of Education are therefore in receipt of the benefits approved by the Government.
.In the present case, it is appropriate to indicate that it is the responsibility of the Minister to take a position on the errors and omissions observed in documents related to the procedures commenced by unions, with a view to preventing flaws in such procedures. This obligation should not be considered a violation of freedom of association, as such a violation would occur if, on the contrary, the labour official responsible failed to indicate the errors or omissions observed, thereby allowing a flawed procedure to go ahead.
.It should be emphasized that our country is one of the few, if not the only country, in which there are countless trade union organizations in all of which workers pay union dues, which is in itself contrary to the law as it constitutes an assignment of the economic assets of workers; FLATEC does not refer in its communication to this factor, which it would be important to address.
.With a view to demonstrating that the contentions of the complainants are without merit, it is necessary to enumerate the omissions that gave rise to the closure of the procedure, and on which the complaint hinges:-	The convocation of the National Advisory Council (by the FVM) does not indicate the capacity in which its signatory is acting, and simply refers to the  National Executive Committee'  in this respect, it should be noted that article  of the Statutes of the second-level union concerned provides that the National Advisory Council has to be convened by all the members of the National Executive Committee, composed in accordance with article  of the Statutes as follows: a president, a secretary-general and  executive secretaries, making a total of  members, who are necessary to convene the National Advisory Council; in the present case, there is only the illegible signature of one citizen. It is also important to point out that the National Advisory Council is not empowered to approve and authorize the submission of a draft collective labour",1,2007,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
91,"agreement, which is the responsibility of the FVM; this means that the draft collective agreement has to be approved finally by the affiliate unions, and not only by an executive body.-	In relation to the records of proceedings of the assemblies of first-level unions, it was noted that the records do not indicate that the statutory quorum was verified, nor do they contain a record of the discussions and decisions, in accordance with section (b) and (d) of the Organic Labour Act: reference should also be made to the omissions of the affiliate unions, as enumerated below:' SINVEMA Petare Barlovento. The list presented is not related to the record of proceedings of the assembly, and the authorization may therefore only be identified as being made by a group of citizens for the submission, discussion and approval of the draft  Sixth Collective Labour Agreement'  with an additional discrepancy between the title of the approved text and that of the text submitted, even though the latter corresponds to the Fifth Collective Labour Agreement.

SINVEMA Amazonas. The convocation did not indicate the time when the assembly was to be held.

.With regard to the document submitted on  July  by citizen Orlando Alzuru (legal representative of the FSV) to which the complainant organizations refer, it should be noted that it contains a communication relating to the collective agreement in question which was received on  May  indicating the intention of citizen Orlando Alzuru to submit in annex to the communication the records of proceedings of the assemblies of teachers who are members of first-level affiliated unions (regional SINVEMAs) in which they authorize and offer support to the executive bodies of the corresponding unions to take the necessary steps to initiate negotiations on the draft Fifth Collective Labour Agreement.
.In this respect, the Government indicates that, even though both communications, the one referred to by the complainant organizations and the other submitted in the file, have the same purpose, they are separate communications, as it is clear that the date on which they were issued is not the same. Moreover, it should be emphasized that by  May , the time limit for rectification had fully elapsed, for which reason that submission has to be considered out of time.
.Of the  unions referred to in the record of proceedings of the assembly submitted by the FVM, only  responded to the call for rectification, which was accordingly incomplete. From all of the foregoing and on the basis of the facts and the law, and acting in full accordance with the legislation that is in force, as was done in the present case, and in view of the existence in the country of the rule of law and justice, in which the right to defence and due process are respected, time limits were established for the rectification process, which were not complied with in the present case. Accordingly, and unfortunately, there was no option other than to comply with these time limits, as any other course of action would have been in violation",1,2007,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
92,"of the provisions of section  of the Organic Labour Act.
.The Committee notes that in their complaint, the complainant organizations challenge the refusal of the authorities of the Ministry of Education and Sport to negotiate the draft text of the Fifth Collective Labour Agreement with the eight national federations, citing to this effect a series of irregularities which, in the view of the complainant organizations, were rectified within the statutory time limits. Nevertheless, the complainant organizations add, the administrative authorities issued a decision to the contrary on  August  and considered that the rectifications of the points raised by the authorities were not valid, thus declaring the procedure closed. In the opinion of the complainants, the failure to renew the collective agreement is prejudicial to the situation of the , teaching personnel of the Ministry.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements in relation to the situation of teaching personnel in which it indicates that a collective agreement was concluded in , and that on  May , a  per cent increase in the wage scale of the teaching personnel of the Ministry of Education and Sport was approved by Presidential Decree No. , in view of the inter-union problems that were prejudicing the labour force. The Committee notes the Government s indication that  May  was the time limit for the rectification of the errors and omissions that had been notified to the unions, that only  of the  affiliate unions of the complainant organization responded to the call for rectification and that the response by the other unions was incomplete. The Government indicates that its position has its basis in the legislation that is in force, the right to defence and to due process and explains that to have acted in any other manner would have been in violation of the Organic Labour Act, and particularly section , and would have resulted in a flawed procedure.
.The Committee notes in this respect that the errors and omissions referred to by the Government are in most cases formalities, such as the failure to indicate the time at which the assembly was held, the omission of the signature of the respective secretary-general, the failure to identify the workers present in the record of proceedings of the assembly, the omission of the date of the convocation for the assembly, lists of teachers not affiliated to the union or who support the negotiations but appear in documents that are separate from the record of proceedings, omission from the record of proceedings of the texts of the decisions approving the submission of the draft agreement for collective bargaining and the divergence between the communication referred to by the complainants and the one contained in the file as the dates are different. The Committee observes that the administrative appeal lodged by the FVM on  September  indicates that the Ministry committed errors in its assessment of the provisions of the trade union statutes that were to be applied and failed to take into account the convocations and records of proceedings submitted on  May  (before the expiry of the time limit set for the rectification process).
.The Committee takes due note of the Government s explanations, which in large part diverge from those of the complainant organizations. The Committee reminds the Government that the requirement of excessive legal formalities in the context of broad bargaining processes (which in the present case involved eight federations) or of compliance with requirements that are difficult to fulfil (such as the need to represent the majority of the workers covered by the negotiations, including at the branch level, and to provide the records of proceedings of union assemblies ' sections ,  and  of the Organic Labour Act) may be contrary to the principle of the promotion of collective bargaining set out in Article  of Convention No. . The Committee brings to the attention of the Government the principle according to which employers, including governmental authorities in the capacity of employers, should recognize for collective bargaining purposes the organizations representative of the workers employed by them; moreover, the Committee reminds the Government that the right to bargain freely with employers with respect to conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and trade unions should have the right, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to seek to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent. The public authorities should refrain from an interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. Any such interference would appear to infringe the principle that workers' and employers' organizations should have the right to organize their activities and to formulate their programmes [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. In this respect, the Committee regrets that the Ministry of Education and Sport did not extend the statutory time limit for the rectification of errors and omissions to which it refers. More generally, the Committee emphasizes the importance of simplifying the legislation so that the executive committees of unions may, if their trade union statutes so permit, directly request the negotiation of a collective agreement, particularly in the case of a request made by a significant number of federations which, as in the present case, benefit from sufficiently well-documented representative status. The Committee requests the Government to take measures in this respect in consultation with the unions.
.Finally, the Committee, reminding the Government of the obligation to promote collective bargaining under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , requests it to take initiatives without delay to facilitate the negotiation of the Fifth Collective Agreement with the eight federations in the sector, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee reminds the Government that the requirement of excessive legal formalities in the context of broad bargaining processes (which in the present case involved eight federations) may be contrary to the principle of the promotion of collective bargaining set out in Article  of Convention No. .

93,".In its previous examination of the case in November , the Committee formulated the following conclusions and recommendation on the issues that were still pending [see th Report, paras ' ]:The Committee recalls that the allegations in this case refer to refusal by the authorities to engage in collective bargaining with the FMV, refusal to grant trade union leave to its officials and obstacles by the authorities to trade union elections in the Federation despite its attempts over the years to hold such elections. When the Committee examined this case for the first time, it requested the Government to amend the Practice of Medicine Act so that, among other things, the FMV would not include both doctors and employers that are owners of medical establishments and, in the meantime, pending amendment of the Act, to promote collective bargaining between the FMV and the doctors' associations with the public employing bodies [see th Report, para. ], so that the Federation could continue to bargain collectively as authorized by law, as it had done. The Government informed the Committee that the revision of the Practice of Medicine Act was before the National Assembly and that it would keep the Committee informed in that regard [see th Report, para. ].The Committee takes note once again of the Government s observations on the new rules of the CNE and the voluntary nature of its intervention, as well as the fact that the FMV consists of doctors' associations, not trade unions. The Committee notes that the Government denies that there has been any interference and states that the CNE has provided all the support requested by the FMV in , but that the CNE does not have any information indicating that the FMV has set up an electoral committee or whether it has given up its intention to hold new elections.The Committee observes that the Government has not provided any information indicating that the authorities have engaged in collective bargaining with the FMV or that a solution has been found to the problem of the refusal by the authorities to grant trade union leave. The Committee observes that the Government has not informed it of any developments in the process of adoption of the draft Practice of Medicine Act. Lastly, as regards the intervention by the CNE and the elections for the executive committee of the FMV, the Committee notes that the Government had stated that the call for elections had been scheduled for  January  [see th Report, para. ] and now states that the CNE does not have any information as to whether the Federation has given up its intention to hold elections or whether an electoral committee has been set up.The Committee recalls that, according to the complaint presented by the FMV, the Federation considers that the intervention by the CNE in its trade union elections violates trade union rights and that it submitted to it because it could not avoid it. Given that the Government states that intervention by the CNE is voluntary, the Committee invites the Government to inform the FMV in writing that it may hold its trade union elections without intervention or supervision (including in regard to appeals) by the CNE, to comply with its previous recommendations on the Practice of Medicine Act, and to ensure that collective bargaining takes place between the FMV and the authorities until such time as the Act is amended. Lastly, the Committee once again requests the Government to maintain the existing entitlement to trade union leave of FMV officials.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments relating to these issues.
.In its communication dated  June , the Venezuelan Medical Federation (FMV) alleges that the Government is blocking, obstructing and freezing all matters concerning this case and that none of the pending issues have been resolved:?Discussion and signing of the collective agreement. The current Government has frozen the collective agreement since  January , the date on which the next agreement was due to be signed. The FMV has submitted at least five draft collective agreements to the labour inspectorate, all of which have been rejected even though they were fully in compliance with the law, on the grounds of a so-called  electoral default' that has kept the salaries of Venezuela s medical association at a pittance.?Blocking of elections to associations by the Government through the National Electoral Council (CNE): The Government lied to the Committee when it said that elections to associations had been scheduled for the (far too ambitious) date of  January , as no such elections were ever convened in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. In January  the FMV submitted a new electoral proposal, in response to which the national electoral commission of the FMV was ignored, and once again had to appeal to the courts.?Establishment of trade union leave as a labour right in all collective agreements signed by the FMV with previous governments, including the current Government. The Government continues to refuse to grant trade union leave for FMV officials, members of doctors' associations and members of a number of national and/or regional labour committees, who, in some cases, have had to appeal to the labour inspectorate to draw attention to the illegality of its refusal. The Government has gone so far as to order the retirement of the President and the Secretary-General of the FMV without their having reached the age stipulated in the collective agreement, against which a judicial appeal has been lodged with the competent authorities.
.Since the Government has not responded to the FMV s demands for an increase in salary and has once again excluded the FMV from the salary increases provided for in the presidential decree, on  April , the Federation declared a labour dispute with the national Government, which is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s biggest employer of physicians.
.In its communication dated  October  the Government repeats that, in compliance with its legal mandate, the CNE adheres to the rules on providing technical assistance and logistical support for trade union elections, and that the electoral authorities only take action if they receive a voluntary request for such technical assistance and logistical support from trade union organizations wishing to organize elections; the FMV made such a request of the CNE in . Consequently, since the Government has taken on board the observations made by the International Labour Organization (ILO) with regard to the CNE, it cannot understand how the Committee can continue referring to interference by the electoral authority, since the measures it has taken are designed to protect the principles of trade union democracy, rotation, impartiality, equality, transparency and respect for freedom of association. The Government therefore vigorously contests the Committee s assertion that the CNE is hampering and delaying trade union elections, not only because there is no legal basis for such an assertion, but also because it contradicts the manner in which the FMV s electoral process takes place, since the transitional electoral committee of the FMV submitted a proposal in the first half of  with regard to the election of the FMV s electoral committee. The Government will inform the Committee of further developments in this process in due course. The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government and requests it to keep it informed of developments, while recalling that the FMV has for years been endeavouring without success to organize its union elections through the CNE.
.The Government states further that, to the best of its knowledge, the FMV and the doctors' associations have not presented any draft collective agreements since  September . The mandate of the Federation s executive board ended in , which according to article  of the regulations established under the Labour Code prevents the board members of the Federation in question from representing their members in collective bargaining and collective disputes, especially in conciliation and arbitration proceedings. Hence they have no authority to promote, negotiate, sign, amend or modify collective labour agreements, as that would exceed the strictly administrative functions that the law grants them. In addition, as has already been amply explained, the FMV s members are doctors' associations and not trade unions. In other words, it is made up of workers and employers, whereas the  purity principle' laid down in article  of the regulations under the Labour Code stipulates that no trade union may be constituted which seeks to represent the interests of both the workers and the employers. The Government points out that the Committee cannot ask it to contravene the law and to negotiate a collective agreement with a group that has no authority and no mandate to do so. The Committee recalls that it had requested the Government to amend the legislation on doctors' associations so as to guarantee the principle referred to by the Government, but that it had requested the Government, in the meantime, to engage in collective bargaining with the FMV so that the FMV could defend the",-1,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
94,"labour rights of physicians.
.Regarding the question of trade union leave for FMV officials, the Government states that, as stipulated in the labour legislation, union officials who are members of the executive board of the Federation are entitled to trade union leave, and it wishes to draw this to the attention of the Committee. The Committee takes note of this information.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial appeal against the alleged compulsory retirement of the President and Secretary-General of the FMV by order of the authorities, in violation of the collective agreement.
.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee formulated the following recommendations on the issues that were still pending [see th Report, paras ' ]:' The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the revised Practice of Medicine Act as soon as it has been adopted and to take account of the Committee s conclusions in the present case. The Committee also requests the Government to supply information on the outcome of the FMV elections convened for  January  within the framework of the CNE. The Committee notes the FMV s statement that for years it has met the legal requirements for holding such elections, that the Government maintains that there had been omissions and that the CNE called for rectifications to be made. The Committee observes, according to its understanding of the Government s reply, that the FMV is an organization of doctors' associations (and not a trade union federation) and as such it cannot engage in bargaining in accordance with the  purity principle' (as established by section  of the Organic Labour Act). This argument was previously examined by the Committee and the FMV indicated that the legislation in force gives it the right to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of its members.' The Committee notes with regret that in this case, as in previous ones, the proceedings and appeals dealt with by the CNE and its decisions have resulted in the FMV elections being delayed for years. The Committee requests the Government once again to ensure that the CNE refrains from interfering in elections of organizations. The Committee reminds the Government that it previously asked it to promote collective bargaining between the FMV and doctors' associations, on the one hand, and the medical sector employers, on the other, pending the amendment of the Practice of Medicine Act. The Committee again requests the Government to guarantee this collective bargaining and regrets that the Government has previously failed to do so.' Finally, it is the Committee s understanding (the Government has not sent any specific information in this respect) that the refusal to grant trade union leave to FMV officials is based on the same reasoning as the refusal to engage in collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to maintain the existing entitlement to trade union leave of FMV leaders.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government refers to the new rules adopted on  May  by the National Electoral Council (CNE) on technical advice and logistical support for trade union elections and states that these rules define the parameters for action by the electoral authority in response to voluntary requests from trade unions for technical advice and logistical support for holding trade union elections. These provisions protect the principles and fundamental rights to active participation, trade union democracy, suffrage by men and women trade union members, free choice and re-election of trade union representatives, guaranteeing reliability, equality, impartiality, transparency, publicity of proceedings, good faith, procedural economy and efficiency, and respect for freedom of association. There is thus no interference of any kind by the CNE in the elections of the executive committees of the country s trade unions. The Government requests the Committee to take due note of its arguments, as it has informed it repeatedly in previous replies that the recommendations of the different ILO bodies have been complied with by amending the former CNE rules to limit its action to providing support only when requested to do so by a trade union. The Government therefore fails to understand why the Committee continues to single it out for alleged interference in trade union elections even when its observations have been heeded and implemented.
.The Government adds that the Venezuelan Medical Federation (FMV) is composed of doctors' associations, which in turn consist of both workers and employers. Section  of the Organic Labour Act provides that trade unions may be for workers or employers, and section  of the regulations implementing the Organic Labour Act establishes the  purity principle' as follows:Prohibition of mixed trade unions (purity principle). Section . Establishing a trade union which seeks to represent jointly the interests of workers and employers shall be prohibited ...
.The Government states further that the Organic Labour Act provides that five or more trade unions may establish a federation; however, as has already been mentioned, the FMV does not consist of trade unions, but of doctors' associations, and therefore does not have the status of a federation as stipulated by law, since doctors' associations are not trade unions. The FMV cannot claim to be a trade union as it is a professional association and, as such, applied to the CNE for registration on  May . The Government accordingly requests the Committee to take due note of this argument.
.The Government states that in , the authorities of the FMV, in a communication addressed to the CNE, requested its support in holding its elections. The FMV electoral committee subsequently sent a communication to the CNE in  requesting the Trade Union Affairs Department of the CNE to assist it in preparing its election plan so that the new electoral committee of that Federation of professional associations could issue a call for elections. The CNE provided all the support that the FMV had voluntarily requested; however, according to the CNE itself, there is no information indicating that the Federation has set up an electoral committee to proceed with its elections. Neither does the CNE have any information as to whether the Federation has given up its declared intention to hold elections.
.In conclusion, the Government points out that all of the above attests to the fact that neither the CNE nor any Venezuelan state body has refused to support and further the election process for the executive committee of the FMV (consisting of doctors' associations and not trade unions, as affirmed by the Federation itself). On the contrary, it is common knowledge that the public institutions have abided faithfully and fully by the constitutional and legal framework in force.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations in this case refer to refusal by the authorities to engage in collective bargaining with the FMV, refusal to grant trade union leave to its officials and obstacles by the authorities to trade union elections in the Federation despite its attempts over the years to hold such elections. When the Committee examined this case for the first time, it requested the Government to amend the Practice of Medicine Act so that, among other things, the FMV would not include both doctors and employers that are owners of medical establishments and, in the meantime, pending amendment of the Act, to promote collective bargaining between the FMV and the doctors' associations with the public employing bodies [see th Report, para. ], so that the Federation could continue to bargain collectively as authorized by law, as it had done. The Government informed the Committee that the revision of the Practice of Medicine Act was before the National Assembly and that it would keep the Committee informed in that regard [see th Report, para. ].
.The Committee takes note once again of the Government s observations on the new rules of the CNE and the voluntary nature of its intervention, as well as the fact that the FMV consists of doctors' associations, not trade unions. The Committee notes that the Government denies that there has been any interference and states that the CNE has provided all the support requested by the FMV in , but that the CNE does not have any information indicating that the FMV has set up an electoral committee or whether it has given up its intention to hold new elections.
.The Committee observes that the Government has not provided any information indicating that the authorities have engaged in collective bargaining with the FMV or that a solution has been found to the problem of the refusal by the authorities to grant trade union leave. The Committee observes that the Government has not informed it of any developments in the process of adoption of the draft Practice of Medicine Act. Lastly, as regards the intervention by the CNE and the elections for the executive committee of the FMV, the Committee notes that the Government had stated that the call for elections had been scheduled for  January  [see th Report, para. ] and now states that the CNE does not",-1,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
95,"have any information as to whether the Federation has given up its intention to hold elections or whether an electoral committee has been set up.
.The Committee recalls that, according to the complaint presented by the FMV, the Federation considers that the intervention by the CNE in its trade union elections violates trade union rights and that it submitted to it because it could not avoid it. Given that the Government states that intervention by the CNE is voluntary, the Committee invites the Government to inform the FMV in writing that it may hold its trade union elections without intervention or supervision (including in regard to appeals) by the CNE, to comply with its previous recommendations on the Practice of Medicine Act, and to ensure that collective bargaining takes place between the FMV and the authorities until such time as the Act is amended. Lastly, the Committee once again requests the Government to maintain the existing entitlement to trade union leave of FMV officials.
.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments relating to these issues.
.At its June  meeting the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters which remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee notes the new information from the FMV [Venezuelan Medical Federation] and the comments of the Government. The Committee notes that the Government merely reiterates its earlier responses to the Committee, and invokes the incompatibility of the national rules governing the FMV and Conventions Nos  and . The Committee notes with regret that the Government has ignored its recommendations in which it specifically requested the amendment of the Practice of Medicine Act and the promotion of collective bargaining between the authorities in the health sector and the FMV. The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendations and requests the Government to supply information in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to indicate why the National Electoral Council has not authorized the elections of the executive committee of the FMV and to provide the text of the decisions adopted in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to respond to the allegation concerning the suspension of the trade union leave of FMV officials.
.The Committee recalls that it previously made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures without delay, after full, frank and free consultations with the social partners, to amend the Practice of Medicine Act and to eliminate the discrepancies with Conventions Nos  and , which have been recognized by the Government, and also to avoid gaps in professional relations and reminds the Government that ILO technical assistance is at its disposal.(b) The Committee requests the Government in the meantime, until such time as it amends the Practice of Medicine Act, to promote collective bargaining between the FMV and the colleges of doctors with the employing bodies in the medical sector, including the MDSD, the IVSS and the IPASME.
.In its communications dated  June , the Venezuelan Medical Federation (FMV) stated that following the presentation of three draft collective agreements in three health institutions in August  (Ministry of People s Power for Health, Venezuelan Social Security Institute and Social Welfare and Assistance Institute), the Ministry of Labour did not take the action provided for in the legislation, to the consequent detriment of the doctors. The FMV points out that the authorities have prevented it from engaging in collective bargaining for years, citing  overdue elections'  but at the same time the National Electoral Council (CNE) (a public body) has not authorized it to conduct its elections despite it having fulfilled the legal requirements.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that the revision of the Practice of Medicine Act is before the National Assembly s Social Development Commission, the provisions of this legislative text are anachronistic and outdated in relation to the social reality and the constitutional and legal standards in force. When information is available on any progress made, it will be sent in due course to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Government states that the legislative agenda of the Social Development Commission this year includes a first discussion of the special Bill against malpractice. The Bill envisages regulation for irregular situations in medical practice, penalizing the whole of a team involved in such a situation on the grounds that responsibility should not lie with just one person but with all the players involved in cases involving irregularities or adverse outcomes. Moreover, the abovementioned Social Development Commission, through the Health Subcommission, will resume consideration of the Public Health System Act, already approved at first discussion, in November this year. One of its main proposals is to incorporate all centres providing health services into a single system, the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) having participated by making suggestions and its representatives taking part in discussions.
.As regards the promotion of collective bargaining with regard to the FMV and specifically with regard to it status, it should be noted that the federation is composed of associations of doctors of the country, which are in turn specifically made up of workers and employers. Section  of the Organic Labour Act states that trade unions may be for workers or employers, and section  of the regulations implementing the Organic Labour Act establishes the  purity principle' as follows:  Prohibition of mixed trade unions (purity principle). Section . Establishing a trade union which seeks to represent jointly the interests of workers and employers shall be prohibited ...'  Accordingly, the FMV is not composed of trade unions but of doctors' associations and hence it does not have the status of federation as stipulated by law. The FMV cannot therefore qualify as a trade union since it is a professional association and as such it applied to the CNE for registration on  May .
.As regards the alleged changes to its leadership and the CNE s alleged refusal to authorize the FMV election process, the Government declares that on  September  the FMV electoral commission deposited the draft for the elections to the federation s electoral commission with the CNE, and requested authorization to convene the election, which was scheduled for  January  (in this process the CNE supported the FMV). Previously, since , the FMV made arrangements to hold elections but the CNE noted some omissions and called for a number of points to be rectified.
.The Government concludes, on the basis of all of the above, that there is no refusal, nor has there ever been, by the CNE or any Venezuelan state body to authorize the election process for the FMV executive committee or to discuss the collective labour agreement for this professional association. On the contrary, it is common knowledge that the public institutions demonstrate full and faithful compliance with regard to the legal system.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to send the text of the revised Practice of Medicine Act as soon as it has been adopted and to take account of the Committee s conclusions in the present case. The Committee also requests the Government to supply information on the outcome of the FMV elections convened for  January  within the framework of the CNE. The Committee notes the FMV s statement that for years it has met the legal requirements for holding such elections, that the Government maintains that there had been omissions and that the CNE called for rectifications to be made. The Committee observes, according to its understanding of the Government s reply, that the FMV is an organization of doctors' associations (and not a trade union federation) and as such it cannot engage in bargaining in accordance with the  purity principle' (as established by section  of the Organic Labour Act). This argument was previously examined by the Committee and the FMV indicated that the legislation in force gives it the right to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of its members.
.The Committee notes with regret that in this case, as in previous ones, the proceedings and appeals dealt with by the CNE and its decisions have resulted in the FMV elections being delayed for years. The Committee requests the Government once again to ensure that the CNE refrains from interfering in elections of organizations. The Committee reminds the Government that it previously asked it to promote collective bargaining between the FMV and doctors' associations, on the one hand, and the medical sector employers, on the other, pending the amendment of the Practice of Medicine Act. The Committee again requests the Government to guarantee this collective bargaining and regrets that the Government has previously failed to do so.
.Finally, it is the Committee s understanding (the Government has not sent any specific information in this respect) that the refusal to grant trade union leave to FMV officials is based on the same reasoning as the refusal to engage in collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to maintain the existing entitlement to trade union",-1,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
96,"leave of FMV leaders.
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures without delay, after full, frank and free consultations with the social partners, to amend the Practice of Medicine Act and to eliminate the discrepancies with Conventions Nos  and , which have been recognized by the Government, and also to avoid gaps in professional relations and reminds the Government that ILO technical assistance is at its disposal.(b) The Committee requests the Government in the meantime, until such time as it amends the Practice of Medicine Act, to promote collective bargaining between the FMV and the colleges of doctors with the employing bodies in the medical sector, including the MDSD, the IVSS and the IPASME.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.With regard to the first of these matters, the Committee reached the following conclusions [see th Report, paras  and ]:' The Committee shares the Government s view that the Practice of Medicine Act of  August  contains provisions incompatible with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  and should be amended since, on the one hand, it establishes compulsory affiliation of doctors on pain of sanctions, as well as a single medical federation which includes colleges of doctors, workers and employers and/or owners of medical establishments and, on the other, endows the Federation and colleges of doctors with the exclusive right of representation for the purposes of collective bargaining, whether or not there are other trade union organizations, and makes agreements concluded at local level by colleges of doctors subject to approval by the FMV (the corresponding provisions are reproduced in the annexes and/or the Government s reply).' The Committee recalls, however, that the responsibility for aligning legislation with ratified Conventions belongs to the Government. The Committee observes that the FMV is a group of colleges of doctors for which affiliation is compulsory, which as professional bodies would to some extent fall outside the scope of Conventions Nos  and  although not in other aspects since the legislation grants these bodies the rights of trade unions including their right to collective bargaining. In these circumstances, the Committee points out that in  and  the FMV had signed collective agreements and that the Government had not denied the failure of the Inspectorate of Labour to convene the employers' side nor that discussions of future collective agreements had never begun. The Committee finds that in the circumstances described above (inconsistent with and in violation of Conventions Nos  and ), the FMV has been representing and represents all doctors in the country. The Committee regrets that the Government has simply chosen to change its previous practice in relation to collective bargaining with the FMV apparently without informing the Federation of its new approach and without taking measures to correct the provisions in the legislation in a way which would fully assure the guarantees of freedom of association for the medical sector while promoting an effective collective bargaining mechanism. For all these reasons, it seems that the medical sector has been forced, for lack of action by the Government, to go several years without a collective agreement governing its conditions of employment.
.In its communications dated  April and  June , the Venezuelan Medical Federation (FMV) claims that, further to the Committee s recommendations, it contacted the Ministry of Labour requesting the commencement of discussions on the collective agreements with the employing bodies in the Government (Ministry of Health and Social Development (MSDS), Venezuelan Social Security Institute (IVSS) and Ministry of Education Staff Pensions and Welfare Institute (IPASME)) and the appropriate authorities, but it received no reply. The FMV indicates that the draft collective agreements had been introduced in  and that, in October , the Labour Inspectorate had invoked  overdue elections' (of the FMV s executive committee) to prevent negotiation; however, the FMV renewed the membership of its executive committee in accordance with its rules and those of the National Electoral Council, even though the Council has not yet authorized the election process. Furthermore, the Government is using the claim of  overdue elections' to suspend the trade union leave of FMV officials.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states that this complaint has not been changed and that no new arguments have been put forward by the complainants that merit any kind of response; nevertheless, and with the greatest will and eagerness to cooperate, the Government reiterates the points made in the communications sent on  August and  October  and informs this international body that, since the date mentioned above, no applications or new arguments have been presented that require the Government s attention.
.The Government adds that, already aware of the opinions and conclusions of the Committee on Freedom of Association in similar cases, in the name of the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, it considers that the complaint made by the FMV must be dismissed as it is entirely unfounded in the light of the provisions of Conventions Nos  and ; therefore, it reiterates the request for this case to be closed, given the incompatibility between the rules mentioned in the complaint and the Conventions mentioned in the responses duly provided on behalf of the Government.
.The Committee notes the new information from the FMV and the comments of the Government. The Committee notes that the Government merely reiterates its earlier responses to the Committee, and invokes the incompatibility of the national rules governing the FMV and Conventions Nos  and . The Committee notes with regret that the Government has ignored its recommendations in which it specifically requested the amendment of the Practice of Medicine Act and the promotion of collective bargaining between the authorities in the health sector and the FMV. The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendations and requests the Government to supply information in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to indicate why the National Electoral Council has not authorized the elections of the executive committee of the FMV and to provide the text of the decisions adopted in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to respond to the allegation concerning the suspension of the trade union leave of FMV officials.
.The Government sent its observations in its communication of  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures without delay, after full, frank and free consultations with the social partners, to amend the Practice of Medicine Act and to eliminate the discrepancies with Conventions Nos.  and , which have been recognized by the Government, and also to avoid gaps in professional relations and reminds the Government that ILO technical assistance is at its disposal.(b) The Committee requests the Government in the meantime, until such time as it amends the Practice of Medicine Act, to promote collective bargaining between the FMV and the colleges of doctors with the employing bodies in the medical sector, including the MDSD, the IVSS and the IPASME.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",-1,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  February .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the pending issues [see th Report, para. ]:(a) Expressing its deep concern at the problems faced by the complainant in exercising its trade union rights, the Committee again urges the Government to open a direct, constructive dialogue with SUNEP SAS on the pending issues: reform of the union s rules; elections to the executive committee; exercise of the right to engage in collective bargaining; taking of union leave; payment of the authorities' debts to the union for the implementation of educational and social programmes; and confiscation of union premises.(b) The Committee expects that a prompt solution to these issues can be found and that the Government will guarantee the trade union rights of SUNEP SAS, and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) The Committee requests the Government, if recourse to the CNE in trade union elections is voluntary, as the Government has stated, to give clear explanations and assurances in writing to SUNEP SAS that it can hold its elections without any intervention by the authorities, and to transmit a copy of such a communication.(d) In view of the fact that the judicial authority of the first level ordered the reinstatement of union official Mr Yuri Girardot Salas Moreno (although this decision was quashed at second level), that the grounds for dismissal were the taking of union leave to which he was not entitled and that there is nothing in the legal ruling to suggest that the union official acted in bad faith, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to reinstate him without delay and to ensure that the receives full compensation, including payment of lost salary and other benefits.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states, with regard to the points raised by the Committee regarding the situation of the Single National Union of Public, Professional, Technical and Administrative Employees of the Ministry of Health and Social Development (SUNEP SAS) (with regard to direct dialogue, reform of the union s statutes, elections to the executive committee, exercise of the right to collective bargaining, entitlements to union leave, payment of debts to the union, and confiscation of union premises), that SUNEP SAS held elections to its executive committee on  February  and that to date no draft collective agreement has been submitted. The Government reiterates that there is no question of a refusal by the health authorities or the Government itself to enter into dialogue or bargain collectively with the organization; it is simply that any trade union organization is required to satisfy established legal criteria in order to be authorized to represent workers in the discussions and negotiations leading to collective labour agreements and, thus, once the union has submitted its proposed text of a collective agreement in accordance with the law, the text will be discussed with the appropriate authorities.
.As regards the alleged confiscation of union premises, the Government states that it has no information on this point and suggests that the Committee seek further and more specific information in this regard in order to be able to examine this allegation.
.As regards the Committee s recommendation concerning Mr Yuri Girardot Salas Moreno, in view of the fact that the judicial authority of the first level ordered the reinstatement of the union official but the decision was rescinded by a higher level court, the Government notes with interest the Committee s recommendation, which reflects primarily the fact that in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela the rule of law prevails, given that the individual in question availed himself at all times of the appropriate legal avenues of redress, and in this case the judicial authority has responded promptly to his complaint against the Ministry of People s Power for Health; he was thus able, as the Committee itself acknowledges, to win at first instance his claim for reinstatement in his post in the Ministry. The Government states that the citizen in question acted correctly in bringing his case before the courts, which is the appropriate channel for obtaining redress for rights allegedly violated by the Government.
.In the same line of events, the legal representative of the Ministry of People s Power for Health lodged an appeal before the Second Court for Administrative Disputes against the ruling given on  December  by the Sixth Higher Court for Administrative Disputes of the Capital District. On  March , the Second Court for Administrative Disputes upheld the appeal lodged by the Ministry of People s Power for Health and rescinded the original ruling, quashing the administrative action initiated by Mr Yuri Girardot.
.The Government adds that the citizen in question did not avail himself of the right to seek a review of the ruling, for which a period of six months is allowed under law, and his employment at the Ministry of People s Power for Health was consequently legally terminated. Given the final and enforceable nature of the ruling, the executive is not in a position to disregard a decision of the judiciary.
.Allegations regarding the complainant organization s difficulties in exercising its trade union rights. The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect thatSUNEP SAS held elections to its executive committee on  February ; once the union submits its proposed text of a collective agreement, in accordance with the law, the text will be discussed with the appropriate authorities.
.The Committee trusts that, in its new situation, the complainant organization, in the context of exercising the right to collective bargaining, will be able to initiate direct and constructive dialogue with the health authorities on other questions raised with the Committee (entitlements to union leave, payment of debts owed by the authorities to the union, and implementation of educational and social programmes under the terms of previous collective agreements), and trusts that a solution will be found quickly. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In addition, and noting the Government s request, the Committee requests the complainant organization to supply as much information as possible on the alleged confiscation of union premises, in order to enable the Government to provide complete information.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of a trade union official. The Committee takes due note of the Government s statements to the effect that : () the union official, Mr Girardot Salas Moreno, did not lodge a final appeal against the appeal ruling which rescinded the reinstatement order given by the court of first instance; and () Mr Girardot Salas Moreno did not seek a review of the final appeal ruling within the legally stipulated period of six months, and as a result that ruling is now final and enforceable; the Government states that, consequently, it is not in a position to disregard the ruling of a judicial authority by, for example, adopting measures requested by the Committee to reinstate the individual in question.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee trusts that, in its new situation, the complainant organization, in the context of exercising the right to collective bargaining, will be able to initiate direct and constructive dialogue with the health authorities on certain questions raised with the Committee (entitlements to union leave, payment of debts owed by the authorities to the union, and implementation of educational and social programmes under the terms of previous collective agreements), and trusts that a solution will be found quickly. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) Lastly, and noting the Government s request, the Committee requests the complainant organization to supply as much information as possible on the alleged confiscation of union premises, in order to enable the Government to provide complete information.

.In its previous examination of the case at its March  meeting, the Committee made the following",0,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
98,"recommendations on the pending issues [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee invites the complainant organization to rectify, in form and in substance, the points signalled by the administrative authority relating to the amendments to the SUNEP SAS statutes, and requests the Government, once that rectification is accomplished, to fully comply without delay with the principle of non-interference by the authorities in trade union affairs and, in particular, the right of trade unions to draw up their by-laws.(b) The Committee urges the Government to take measures to ensure that the labour authorities and the National Electoral Council stop interfering in the internal affairs of SUNEP SAS, such as the elections of its executive committee, and to guarantee that the right to bargain collectively of this trade union is upheld, without discriminating against it in respect of other organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether it has implemented the Committee s previous recommendations to guarantee that SUNEP SAS does not have its trade union premises confiscated.
.In its communication dated  May , SUNEP SAS refers to the issues previously raised and points out that the authorities continue to infringe its rights as a trade union. Even though intervention by the National Electoral Council (CNE) constitutes interference in trade union autonomy, SUNEP SAS contacted the CNE once again in writing on  March  requesting the procedure for the election of its executive committee to be started, but there has been no reply to date. The Ministry of People s Power for Health, citing supposed  electoral default' (delays in elections since ), has been refusing trade union leave, the exercise of the right to engage in collective bargaining and the payment of debts to the union (, bolivares fuertes) to cover the cost of social and educational programmes (deriving from collective agreements) between  and . In general, SUNEP SAS alleges a hostile attitude on the part of the Ministry authorities responsible for labour or health matters expressed in its refusal to receive the union s officials, even though the union and these ministries have headquarters in the same building, and in its response to the union s written requests and appeals, which is characterized by months of delays and excessive formalities concerning points for rectification (emphasizing grammatical or editorial errors, use of stamps, etc.), as in the case of the union s reform of its rules (the union then undertook the necessary rectification and the Ministry considered it inadequate).
.The complainant union also refers to the conclusions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, noting with interest the Government s statement to the effect that trade unionist Mr Yuri Girardot Salas Moreno (who had been dismissed) was working, since the judicial proceedings which he had initiated had been settled in his favour [see th Report, para. ]. SUNEP SAS adds, however, that on  March  the second-level judicial authority examined an appeal by the Government and quashed the ruling ordering the reinstatement of the trade unionist.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states with regard to the allegations concerning the CNE that, by means of Decision No. - of  May  published in Electoral Gazette No.  of  May  of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the CNE issued the regulations concerning technical advice and logistical support with respect to trade union elections. When these regulations came into force, the regulations for the election of trade union authorities issued by the CNE by means of Decision No. -, published in Electoral Gazette No.  of  January , were repealed. Moreover, by means of Decision No. , also of  May  and published in Electoral Gazette No. , the CNE issued the regulations for guaranteeing the human rights of workers in trade union elections.
.The Government adds that these regulations establish the parameters for defining action by the electoral authority whenever its technical advice and logistical support for organizing electoral procedures are requested voluntarily by trade unions. These regulations protect the principles and human rights relating to participation in leadership, trade union democracy, the voting rights of trade union members and the free election of union representatives and their subsequent re-election or replacement, guaranteeing reliability, equality, impartiality and transparency, disclosure of legal documents, good faith, economy and efficiency in proceedings and processes, and respect for freedom of association.
.Consequently, as has been stated on various occasions, there is no interference by the CNE in the election of trade union officers. Specifically, with regard to SUNEP SAS, all requests made by the representatives of this organization have been met by the labour administrative authorities concerned, in accordance with the procedures laid down in the national legislation and international conventions, with timely responses to the union in line with the law. The Government therefore requests the Committee to take due note of this information. The CNE regulations were amended, taking into account the recommendations of the ILO supervisory bodies, and at no time did these regulations violate or undermine the right to freedom of association.
.As regards the request that SUNEP SAS should not be deprived of its union premises, the Government points out that it has no information concerning the supposed confiscation of this organization s union premises. In order to deal with this allegation, more information and specific details are needed from the complainants. In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the social, labour and union rights of workers are observed and guaranteed in strict compliance with the established legal system and the undertakings made at the international level.
.As regards the situation of the SUNEP SAS executive committee, the Government declares that this body is in a situation of  electoral default' since its last elections were held on  November  and no new elections have been held to cover the present term of office, namely ' , as per the union s own rules. Hence the executive committee has no authority to negotiate a collective agreement, framework contract or labour regulations; it merely has the capacity to perform administrative tasks.
.The Government emphasizes that it is not a question of any refusal to engage in collective bargaining with the trade union or of any refusal by the health sector authorities or the Government itself to open a dialogue. The issue is that of compliance by any trade union in the country with the legal requirements for representing workers in discussions and negotiations relating to collective labour agreements.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Expressing its deep concern at the problems faced by the complainant in exercising its trade union rights, the Committee again urges the Government to open a direct, constructive dialogue with SUNEP SAS on the pending issues: reform of the union s rules; elections to the executive committee; exercise of the right to engage in collective bargaining; taking of union leave; payment of the authorities' debts to the union for the implementation of educational and social programmes; and confiscation of union premises.(b) The Committee expects that a prompt solution to these issues can be found and that the Government will guarantee the trade union rights ofSUNEP SAS, and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) The Committee requests the Government, if recourse to the CNE in trade union elections is voluntary, as the Government has stated, to give clear explanations and assurances in writing to SUNEP SAS that it can hold its elections without any intervention by the authorities, and to transmit a copy of such a communication.(d) In view of the fact that the judicial authority of the first level ordered the reinstatement of union official Mr Yuri Girardot Salas Moreno (although this decision was quashed at second level), that the grounds for dismissal were the taking of union leave to which he was not entitled and that there is nothing in the legal ruling to suggest that the union official acted in bad faith, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to reinstate him without delay and to ensure that the receives full compensation, including payment of lost salary and other benefits.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  February and  May  and  and  March .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with interest the Government s statements to the effect that the trade unionists Yuri Girardot Salas Moreno (who had been dismissed), Francisco Atagua, Mara Tortoza, Jess Alberto Verdu, Nieves Paz, Arminda Mejas and Thamara Tovar (whose dismissal process had begun) are currently",1,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
99,"working, since the proceedings they had initiated were settled in their favour. The Committee also notes with interest that the allegations relating to the trade union leave and to the suspension of trade unionists' wages have been settled following the conclusion of the proceedings initiated by those concerned, and that the leave in question has been renewed and the remuneration owed paid.
.Concerning the alleged refusal by the authorities to accept the amendments to the SUNEP SAS statutes and the union s financial management report for ' , the Committee notes the Government s statement that it happened because the trade union did not comply with the labour inspector s recommendations requiring respect for articles , ,  and  of the Organic Labour Act (the Government attached the administrative decisions). The Committee invites the complainant organization to rectify, in form and in substance, the points signalled by the administrative authority and requests the Government, once that rectification is accomplished, to fully comply without delay, with the principle of non-interference by the authorities in trade union affairs and, in particular, with the right of negotiations to draw up their by-laws.
.As to the allegation concerning the refusal by the authorities to engage in collective bargaining with SUNEP SAS, the authorities' failure to reply to the union s request to subscribe to the  labour standards agreement' (sectoral collective bargaining for the health sector) and the refusal to appoint a representative for the negotiations concerning the draft framework collective agreement presented by another federation, the Committee recalls that, during its previous examination of the case, it urged the health sector authorities to open a constructive dialogue with SUNEP SAS and to keep it informed in this regard.
.On these matters, the Committee notes with regret that the Government does not provide information about any activity to promote dialogue or collective bargaining withSUNEP SAS. The Committee notes that the Government limits itself to stating that SUNEP SAS presented a list of demands on  May  and that the labour inspectorate made observations and requested the rectification of certain omissions, which was not done within the legal deadline and therefore the Labour Inspectorate declared the procedure closed. The Committee also notes the Government s statement that SUNEP SAS lodged a hierarchical appeal and that it will inform the Committee of the result. Lastly, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the refusal for SUNEP SAS to subscribe to the  labour standards agreement that governs working conditions in the health sector' (sectoral collective bargaining) is because the executive committee of SUNEP SAS is in a situation of overdue elections as its last elections were held on  November  (with the executive committee therefore reaching the end of its term on  November ) and to date there has been no documentation to show that further elections have been held.
.The Committee highlights certain ambiguities or contradictions in the Government s reply. The Committee observes, on the one hand, the Government s statement that it refused to allow SUNEP SAS to subscribe to the  labour standards agreement that governs working conditions in the health sector' (sectoral collective bargaining) because the executive committee of SUNEP SAS is in a situation of overdue elections as its last elections were held in , with the executive committee therefore reaching the end of its term on  November  and, on the other hand, its statement that while it initially cancelled the trade union leave of the officials, it has latterly recognized it again. The Committee observes that on another occasion the authorities made observations on the list of demands submitted by SUNEP SAS on  May , requesting the rectification of certain omissions, which ' according to the Government ' was not done, which is why the labour inspectorate declared the procedure closed. Consequently SUNEP SAS lodged a hierarchical (administrative) appeal, which, it would appear from the Government s reply, is still pending. Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has made no reference to the alleged refusal by the authorities to appoint a SUNEP SAS representative for the negotiations concerning the draft framework collective agreement introduced by another federation.
.The Committee deeply deplores the fact that the Government has not complied with its previous recommendation that the health sector authorities open a constructive dialogue with SUNEP SAS to resolve the issues relating to the refusal to bargain collectively with this organization. The Committee regrets that the Government is invoking  overdue elections' and recalls that in earlier examinations of the case it strongly criticized the interference of the National Electoral Council (which is not a judicial authority) in the elections of the executive committee of SUNEP SAS in  (the executive committee was recognized years later, following various appeals and after having lost the possibility of bargaining collectively); it also regrets the excessive delay in the processing of the appeals lodged [see nd Report, paras  et seq. and th Report, paras  et seq.].
.The Committee observes that the Government invokes another alleged electoral delay since  in order not to recognize the executive body of SUNEP SAS. The Committee urges the Government to take measures to ensure that the labour authorities and the National Electoral Council stop interfering in the internal affairs of SUNEP SAS, such as the elections of its executive committee (the Committee recalls that both it and the Committee of Experts and the Committee on the Application of Standards have, on several occasions, criticized the role and actions of the National Electoral Council and have asked it not to intervene in the elections of trade union executive committees), and to guarantee that the right to bargain collectively of this trade union is upheld, without discriminating against it in respect of other organizations. The Committee stresses that the Government cannot invoke an allegedly voluntary resort to the CNE, whereas in practice it is the body supervising union elections, without the endorsement of which the union executive committees are considered invalid. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether it has implemented the Committee s previous recommendations to guarantee that SUNEP SAS does not have its trade union premises confiscated, and requests a detailed reply to the allegation concerning the failure to pay SUNEP SAS the funding due for its social and education programmes for , unlike in previous years (the Government restricted itself to stating that SUNEP SAS can lodge appeals before the authorities, but did not indicate the reasons for the failure to pay).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee invites the complainant organization to rectify, in form and in substance, the points signalled by the administrative authority relating to the amendments to the SUNEP SAS statutes, and requests the Government, once that rectification is accomplished, to fully comply without delay with the principle of non-interference by the authorities in trade union affairs and, in particular, the right of trade unions to draw up their by-laws.(b) The Committee urges the Government to take measures to ensure that the labour authorities and the National Electoral Council stop interfering in the internal affairs of SUNEP SAS, such as the elections of its executive committee, and to guarantee that the right to bargain collectively of this trade union is upheld, without discriminating against it in respect of other organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether it has implemented the Committee s previous recommendations to guarantee that SUNEP SAS does not have its trade union premises confiscated.
.The Committee last examined this case at its May June  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see nd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )]. It also examined the case at its November  meeting, at which it presented another interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )].
.Subsequently, the Single National Union of Public, Professional, Technical and Administrative Employees of the Ministry of Health and Social Development (SUNEPSAS) presented additional information in communications dated  April and  October . The Government communicated its observations in a letter dated  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in November , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee emphasizes the seriousness of the allegations and urges the Government to put an end to the acts of discrimination against SUNEP-SAS and its officials, to guarantee its rights to trade union leave and to collective bargaining and to ensure that its",1,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
100,"trade union premises are not confiscated and that its officials are not dismissed or prejudiced for reasons relating to the exercise of their trade union rights (trade union official Yuri Giradot Salas Moreno has been dismissed; dismissal proceedings are currently under way against trade union officials Francisco Atagua, Nieves Paz, Arminda Mejas and Thamara Tovar; and the pay of  officials of the Miranda section of the complainant trade union has been illegally suspended). The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send the decision on the dismissal of trade union official Yuri Girardot Salas Moreno, specifying the grounds for dismissal, and the outcome of the appeal for review lodged with the Ministry of Health, so that it can examine the case while in full knowledge of the facts.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the additional information and new allegations presented by SUNEP SAS in a communication dated  August .B The complainant s allegations.The allegations presented by SUNEP-SAS in its communication of  August  are summarized below.
.The allegations presented by SUNEP-SAS in its communication of  August  are summarized below.
.SUNEP-SAS denounces the violations committed with regard to members of the executive committee of the Miranda section of SUNEP-SAS by the government authorities of the State of Miranda. Disregard for their status as legitimate representatives of the workers in the sector has worsened, as the situation is currently being examined by the Administrative Disputes Tribunal of the Capital Region but harassment by the employers is continuing. This is borne out not only by the illegal suspension of wages but also by the seizure of the union headquarters by the employer, resulting in the immediate eviction of the union.
.Furthermore, Miranda section executive committee members Francisco Atagua, Thamara Tovar, Arminda Mejas, Nieves Paz, Mara Tortoza and Jess Alberto Verdu went to the labour inspectorate offices on several occasions since November  in order to request amparo (protection of constitutional rights) relating to trade union immunity as provided for in the Organic Labour Act. As inspectorate records show, they came to the inspectorate offices to present the aforementioned amparo request so that the administrative proceedings provided for by the Organic Labour Act could be launched. The labour inspector at the Los Teques headquarters verbally indicated the aforementioned offices' refusal to even take receipt of any written request designed to launch the abovementioned proceedings. In view of the repeated refusal by the said headquarters to take receipt of the request and meet their formal obligations under the Constitution and national law, they presented a written communication setting out the grounds in law and in fact for requesting amparo in relation to trade union immunity at the offices concerned. Faced with the constitutional and legal obligation to respond to such a request, the inspector did not grant amparo with respect to the right in question. Nor did the inspector give any reply with regard to the initiation of administrative proceedings or regarding a negative or affirmative decision in relation to the immunity of these trade union officials and the corresponding union leave.
.Accordingly, court proceedings were instituted and by a ruling of  January  the Third High Court for Civil Administrative Disputes ordered the payment of wages and other economic, labour-related and contractual benefits which had been outstanding since October . In order to guarantee due process and the right of defence, it also ordered the Miranda State Health Corporation administration to refrain from any legal or physical action which would violate the fundamental rights of the parties concerned. The ruling judge also highlighted the negative attitude of the human resources director of the Miranda State Health Corporation, describing such conduct as inconsistent with the duties of loyalty and probity laid down in national law. The authorities and representatives of the Miranda State Health Corporation were therefore called upon to act in accordance with the standards of rectitude required by Venezuelan law. Nevertheless, the fundamental and labour rights of the union officials concerned are still being violated inasmuch as the administration has not complied with the above ruling and the Miranda State Health Corporation withholds recognition of the SUNEP-SAS Miranda section executive committee and continues to violate its rights with an unauthorized suspension of wages.
.As regards the union leave of the members of the executive committee of the Falcn section of the complainant union, the section requested that the union leave be clearly defined. The Legal Advisory Office stated that on  May the  labour regulations agreement' (sectoral bargaining) concluded with a number of other trade unions for employees in the health sector of the national public administration was legally registered, and under these regulations trade union leave is denied to organizations which are not formally participating in the agreement (i.e. SUNEP-SAS).
.This constitutes a blatant violation of both the legislation and Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and so intervention by the regional inspectorate was requested. The same situation has existed since  in the Mrida section of the complainant union despite the said violation having been reported to the regional inspectorate.
.With regard to the La Portuguesa section of the complainant union, even though a communication dated  July  from the Legal Advisory Office stated that  trade union benefits' were being maintained, in reality union officials' rights with respect to leave for union events and union mobilization allowances are being violated. As regards collective bargaining, SUNEP-SAS is suffering discrimination as a result of legal stratagems and obstruction through  administrative silence' of the right to discuss the Draft V Collective Employment Agreement, despite having requested collective bargaining in this regard at multiple hearings with the labour and health ministers, who have failed to accept such requests. The authorities have implemented presidential guidelines according to which the unions have to be done away with, no matter what, unless they submit to being part of the political plans of the head of the regime.
.Against this background, a communication was sent on  July  to the director of the National Inspectorate and Public Sector Collective Labour Office in order to present various points arising from the work of the national secretariat and to request the revival of the Draft V Collective Employment Agreement. With the general secretaries of the  union sections in attendance, they were obliged to lodge a serious protest since the inspector refused to receive them, blocking the right to submit claims and be heard by the official responsible, and in the end they were received by a junior officer, Ms Fanny Duran. The relevant claims were presented and a document was drawn up in which it was agreed that any proceedings arising from the refusal to grant hearings would be the responsibility of the aforementioned labour body.
.The authorities stress the fact that SUNEP-SAS is obliged to have recourse to the administrative dispute bodies of the judiciary, and this, apart from being costly and complicated, is useless because all the authorities are well known to be subject to the dictates of the Executive.
.SUNEP-SAS points out that a simple examination of the payrolls shows that SUNEP-SAS members form an overwhelming majority within the Ministry of Health.
.In its communication of  April , SUNEP-SAS states that the authorities of the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security (formerly the Ministry of Health and Social Development) refuse to bargain collectively. The Ministry refuses, however, to accept the financial management report of  May  stating that the management of union funds was approved by the general assembly of union members. The Ministry also refuses to accept amendments made to the SUNEP-SAS statutes. Appeals made to the administration have received no reply.
.There is continuing harassment of members of the Miranda section executive committee, who are still being refused union leave despite a judicial ruling prohibiting the denial of this right to trade union officials.
.In its communication of  October , SUNEP-SAS alleges that the administrative authority has declared the amended version of the union s financial management report invalid despite the incorporation of the observations made. The union was therefore obliged to lodge an administrative appeal on  May  but no reply was received. However, on  April  the union presented the new financial management report for  to the Ministry and ratified the amendments to the union statutes. The Ministry replied with a request to rectify various errors and defects. The Ministry decided to terminate proceedings on the grounds that it considered the rectifications to be invalid, and this in turn led to the union s appeal for review.
.On  May  the Ministry refused to accept the list of demands from the union, without respecting the right of defence. The union therefore applied to the Ministry to subscribe to the  labour regulations agreement' which had been requested by a trade union federation. A reply has still not been received. Furthermore, disregarding the representativeness of the trade union, the Ministry denied it",1,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
101,"the possibility of appointing representatives for the negotiations concerning the draft model agreement introduced by another federation. The union received no reply here either.
.Moreover, in January , the procedures for granting union leave as requested by SUNEP-SAS were suspended throughout the country.
.Finally, in order to undermine SUNEP-SAS, the Ministry has not paid the union the funding (,, bolivars in the old currency) due for workers' social and educational programmes in  (despite having paid the corresponding dues for ,  and ).
.In its communication of  October , referring to the case of SUNEP-SAS, the Government declares that replies have been made in due and adequate form to each of the observations made by the Committee. It therefore repeats the content thereof, especially communication No. / dated  October  in which ' according to the Government ' detailed information was presented concerning the development and status of the case before the administrative authorities.
.The Government again draws the Committee s attention to the appraisal of the replies sent by the Government, given that it considers the complainants' arguments to have been found completely groundless and therefore requests that they be dismissed and the present case closed.
.The Committee notes that the matters pending in the present case refer to acts of discrimination by the authorities against the public health sector trade union SUNEP-SAS, its sections and its officials, including: () dismissals or proceedings for the dismissal of union officials (Yuri Girardot Salas Moreno, Francisco Atagua, Nieves Paz, Arminda Mejas and Thamara Tovar); () suspension of pay for other persons; () refusal to grant trade union leave; () refusal of the authorities to negotiate with SUNEP-SAS; and () eviction of a section of SUNEP-SAS from its headquarters. SUNEP-SAS emphasizes its defencelessness in many cases because of the administrative authorities' delayed or nonexistent response to their communications and appeals, the discriminatory attitude towards SUNEP-SAS in administrative decisions, even including the authorities' refusal to comply with rulings in favour of SUNEP-SAS concerning the anti-union dismissal of its officials. SUNEP-SAS refers to the authorities' statements to the effect that SUNEP-SAS must go before the judicial bodies dealing with administrative disputes but points out that such proceedings, apart from being costly and complicated, are generally useless because all state authorities are well known to be subject to the dictates of the Executive.
.The Committee notes that SUNEP-SAS alleges that the problems which had been dealt with in the previous examination of the case remain and have worsened inasmuch as the authorities have not accepted amendments to the SUNEP-SAS statutes and have not accepted the financial management report for , obliging the union to lodge a series of appeals which systematically give rise to new requests for rectification from the authorities. Furthermore, according to SUNEP-SAS, trade unionists Mara Tortoza and Jess Alberto Verdu have been dismissed. While disregarding the majority representation of the union at the Ministry of Health and rejecting negotiations with regard to its demands, the authorities have not replied to SUNEP-SAS s request to subscribe to the  labour regulations agreement' (sectoral collective bargaining) requested by a health federation and have denied it the possibility of appointing a representative for the negotiations concerning the draft model agreement presented by another federation. Finally, according to SUNEP-SAS, the Government has not paid it the funding due for its social and education programmes for , unlike in previous years.
.The Committee notes the Government s observations dated  October  to the effect that it has replied in due and adequate form to each of the observations made by the Committee, it therefore repeats the content thereof, especially the communication dated  October  in which detailed information was presented concerning the development and status of the case before the administrative authorities. The Government again draws the Committee s attention to the appraisal of the replies sent by the Government, given that it considers the complainants' arguments to have been found completely groundless and therefore requests that they be dismissed and the present case closed.
.The Committee deeply regrets the lack of cooperation by the Government with respect to its procedures, in view of the Government s disregard for the specific requests for information addressed to it by the Committee at its November  meeting, and drawsthe Government s attention to the fact that the communication dated  October to which it refers was duly examined at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras '  and ' ].
.The Committee observes that despite the seriousness of the problems which were pending in November  and the fact that the National Electoral Council recognized the elections to the SUNEP-SAS executive committee, those issues are still unresolved and in some respects have worsened. The Committee notes with regret the administrative silence, obstacles and delays in procedures highlighted by the complainant and the authorities' refusal to hold a constructive dialogue with the complainant to find a speedy solution to the discrimination which it has been suffering for a number of years.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee repeats its recommendations of November  and again urges the authorities to open a constructive dialogue with SUNEP-SAS to resolve the major issues raised in this case. The Committee requests the Government to reply in detail and without delay to the SUNEP-SAS allegations of  August  and  April and  October .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply regrets the lack of cooperation by the Government with respect to procedures, in view of the Government s disregard for the specific requests for information addressed to it by the Committee in its previous examination of the case and observes that the issues raised by the complainant are still unresolved and in some respects have worsened.(b) The Committee urges the health sector authorities to open a constructive dialogue with SUNEP-SAS to resolve the issues raised in the present case and to keep it informed in this regard.(c) Repeating its previous recommendations, the Committee emphasizes once again the seriousness of the allegations and urges the Government to stop the acts of discrimination against SUNEP-SAS and its officials, to guarantee its rights to trade union leave and to collective bargaining and to ensure that its trade union premises are not confiscated and that its officials are not dismissed or prejudiced for reasons relating to the exercise of their trade union rights (union official Yuri Giradot Salas Moreno has been dismissed; dismissal proceedings are currently under way against union officials Francisco Atagua, Nieves Paz, Arminda Mejas and Thamara Tovar; and the pay of  officials of the Miranda section of the complainant trade union has been illegally suspended). The Committee again urges the Government to keep it informed without delay in this regard.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send the decision on the dismissal of trade union official Yuri Girardot Salas Moreno, specifying the grounds for dismissal, and the outcome of the appeal for review lodged with the Ministry of Health, so that it can examine the case in full knowledge of the facts.(e) The Committee urges the Government to send a detailed reply without delay with respect to the allegations presented by the complainant on  August  and  April and  October , particularly the following:' dismissals, dismissal proceedings against union officials (including Mara Tortoza and Jess Alberto Verdu), non-payment of outstanding wages, refusal to grant union leave;' the refusal by the authorities to accept the amendments to the SUNEPSAS statutes and the union s financial management report for ;' the persistent refusal by the health authorities to engage in collective bargaining with SUNEP-SAS, the authorities' failure to reply to the union s request to subscribe to the  labour standards agreement' (sectoral collective bargaining) requested by a health federation and the refusal to appoint a representative for the negotiations concerning the draft model agreement presented by another federation; and' the failure to pay SUNEP-SAS the funding due for its social and education programmes for , unlike in previous years.
.Subsequently, the Single National Union of Public, Professional, Technical and Administrative Employees of the Ministry of Health and Social Development (SUNEP-SAS) presented additional information in communications dated  October  and  February . In its communication dated  December , Public Services International (PSI) also sent additional information. The Government sent new observations in communications dated , ,  May and  October . SUNEP-SAS presented additional information and new allegations in a communication dated  August .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee emphasizes the seriousness of the allegations and urges the Government to put an end to the acts of discrimination against SUNEP-SAS and its officials, to guarantee its rights to trade",1,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
102,"union leave and to collective bargaining and to ensure that its trade union premises are not confiscated and that its officials are not dismissed or prejudiced for reasons relating to the exercise of their trade union rights (trade union official Yuri Giradot Salas Moreno has been dismissed; dismissal proceedings are currently under way against trade union officials Francisco Atagua, Nieves Paz, Arminda Mejas and Thamara Tovar; and the pay of  officials of the Miranda section of the complainant trade union has been illegally suspended). The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send the decision on the dismissal of trade union official Yuri Girardot Salas Moreno, specifying the grounds for dismissal, and the outcome of the appeal for review lodged with the Ministry of Health, so that it can examine the case while in full knowledge of the facts.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the additional information and new allegations presented by SUNEP-SAS in a communication dated  August .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Regretting the fact that the public authorities have not recognized the union elections of SUNEP-SAS in November , the Committee urges the Government and the public authorities to recognize the executive committee and the union officials who won these elections, and in future to guarantee respect for the principles of non-interference by the public authorities in the trade union elections referred to in the conclusions.(b) The Committee also requests the Government to remedy the negative consequences (denial of collective bargaining rights and of union leave for its officials) suffered by the complainant organization by the failure to recognize its elections in November  and the move to prevent it from participating in discussions on the draft collective agreement presented by one federation in , some years after the Ministry of Labour refused to consider the complainant organization s draft of a collective agreement in December . The Committee requests the Government to ensure the participation of SUNEP-SAS in discussions on the draft collective agreement if these discussions are still in progress.(c) The Committee requests the Government in future also to safeguard the right to collective bargaining and union leave for officials of the complainant organization, leave which had previously been refused in particular with regard to the Anzotegui section of SUNEP-SAS.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the follow-up to these recommendations, and to submit its observations concerning the new allegations made by SUNEP-SAS on  January  in connection with the unlawful pay suspension imposed on  leaders of SUNEP-SAS, Miranda section.",-1,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
103,".The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee considers that, in its present state, the Statute on the election of trade union officials adopted by the National Electoral Council constitutes a serious breach of Article  of Convention No.  and should be promptly amended so as to bring it into full conformity with Convention No. . The Committee also requests the Government to communicate these conclusions to the National Electoral Council, trusts that the Statute will be amended without delay, and asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in this matter. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the draft law before the National Assembly which grants the National Electoral Council the possibility to intervene in trade union elections only at the request of the trade union organizations.(b) Regarding the allegations relating to the Ministry of Labour Resolution of  February  giving trade union organizations  days to provide information on their administration and register of members in a form that includes each worker s full identity, place of residence and signature, the Committee considers that the confidentiality of trade union membership should be ensured and recalls that it would be advisable to establish, between trade unions, a code of conduct governing the conditions in which membership data is to be supplied, with the use of appropriate means of personal data processing, with guarantees of absolute confidentiality.(c) Regarding the cancellation of the  elections of the executive committee of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) by a resolution of the National Electoral Council on  January , the Committee observes that the CNE is not an independent judicial body which could afford sufficient guarantees of the right of defence and due process and, consequently, it should not have the authority to declare trade union elections null and void. The Committee also observes that challenging the results of trade union elections should not have the effect of suspending their validity pending the outcome of the judicial proceedings. The Committee regrets that, in the last four years, the Government has not recognized de jure the CTV, considers that the cancellation of the elections of the CTV executive committee was a serious violation of Article  of Convention No. , and expects that the next trade union elections will be held without any interference by the National Electoral Council.",0,2005,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant objects to the interference by the authorities following trade union elections held in March  by the Single Trade Union of Workers of Health Care and Private and Public Social Security Institutions in Carabobo State (SUTRASALUD CARABOBO).
.The Committee notes the decision of the Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of  July , which sets aside the appeal filed on  March  by Jos Mogolln, former president of SUTRASALUD CARABOBO, against the Decision of the National Electoral Council No. - of  January , published in the Electoral Gazette No.  of  February , which formerly acknowledged the validity of the elections held by SUTRASALUD CARABOBO on  November . These elections were a partial rerun of elections held in March  and were ordered by the National Electoral Council.
.The Committee notes that, for the reasons indicated in the Electoral Chamber s decision, reproduced in the Government s reply, the Chamber has not substantively examined a number of complaints by the appellant (former president of SUTRASALUD CARABOBO) against the partial rerun of the elections held by the Single Trade Union of Workers of Health Care and Private and Public Social Security Institutions in Carabobo State (SUTRASALUD CARABOBO) on  November , namely:(i) invalidity of the Trade Union Electoral Commission which conducted the partial rerun of the election;(ii) invalid set up of the voting tables and balloting arrangements, under the terms of section  of the Organic Act respecting voting rights and political participation;(iii) invalidity of the votes because of the illegal constitution of the polling station, in accordance with section  of the Organic Act respecting suffrage and political participation;(iv) lack of evidence of  other factors adverse to the supposed winning list' owing to interference by the National Guard;(v) inconsistency with election results;(vi) invalidity of the ballot records; and(vii) ineligibility of Carlos Viloria and Jess Pinto.
.In his complaint, the former president of SUTRASALUD CARABOBO alleges, for example, that the Electoral Commission did not include the requisite number of members on  November , because three of the principle members were prevented from attending the elections, and the ballot records were signed by only two members, in contravention of union rules.
.The Committee points out that on previous occasions, it has objected to the role assigned by the Constitution and legislation to the National Electoral Council in organizing and supervising trade union elections, including the power to suspend elections; it has considered that the organization of elections should be exclusively a matter for the organizations concerned, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , and that the power to suspend elections should be given only to an independent judiciary, which alone can provide sufficient guarantees of the right to defence and due process. In addition, the complainant has highlighted the presence of and interference by the National Guard and other authorities in the (partial) elections which the National Electoral Council had ordered to be rerun on  November at one of the voting centres. The Committee also notes the delays by the CNE, which did not give a ruling on the trade union elections of March  until  November , and by the Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, which gave its ruling on  July  regarding the CNE decision, but without giving any ruling on the substance of the appellant s arguments. The Committee greatly regrets the interference by various state authorities, including the National Electoral Council, in the SUTRASALUD CARABOBO elections, and requests the Government in future to refrain from such interference and to ensure that trade union elections can take place without interference by the public authorities, and that any suspension of trade union elections is a matter solely for the judicial authority. The Committee considers, however, given the Electoral Chamber s ruling in June  and the considerable time that has passed since the elections in March , that it will not recommend a further rerun of the elections.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee greatly regrets the interference by various state authorities including the National Electoral Council, in the SUTRASALUD CARABOBO union elections, and requests the Government in future to refrain from such interference and to ensure that trade union elections can take place without interference by the public authorities, and that any suspension of such elections is a matter solely for the judicial authority.",0,2004,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
106,".The Committee last examined this case (presented in March ) at its June  session and on that occasion presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras  to , approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (June )].
.The Government sent further observations in a communication of  March .
.The Committee recalls that in its previous examination of the case it noted that various recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry ' appointed by the Governing Body in the light of the complaint made under article  of the ILO Constitution by various Employers' delegates to the th Session of the International Labour Conference against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and mandated to examine the country s non-observance of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) among other Conventions ' refer to issues raised in case No. . The Committee observes that the Commission of Inquiry established in its report that, in the light of the gravity of the issues raised, the situation and the progress achieved on its recommendations should be the subject of active supervision by the ILO supervisory bodies concerned. Given the gravity and persistence of the matters involved in this case, the Committee requested the Government to send its observations in relation to its previous recommendations and in the light of the relevant recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry, so that at its following session it might pursue its examination of the case with full knowledge of the facts. The Committee also observes that, at each of its sessions, the Governing Body discusses the periodic progress report on developments concerning the social dialogue forum set up to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry with respect to the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.At its June  session, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee once again firmly urges the Government to adopt all measures necessary to end immediately all acts of hostility and intimidation against FEDECAMARAS so that it may exercise its representative activities in full freedom, and to ensure that the necessary foundations for genuine social dialogue in the country are established. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on specific action taken in this regard.(b) The Committee once again urges the Government and all competent authorities to take all necessary measures without delay to ensure that all of the instigators and perpetrators of the attacks examined in the present case are identified and appropriately punished and to ensure that any compensation measures sought by the victims of the attacks are applied. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on progress made in this regard.(c) In relation to the criminal proceedings initiated against certain leaders of a meat processing company and a supermarket chain, the Committee urges the competent authorities to: (i) make every effort to expedite the judicial proceedings that are still under way and (ii) duly and fully take into account the employers' right to freely exercise their representative activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d) The Committee firmly urges the Government to: (i) provide detailed information on the outcomes of the social dialogue forum called for by the Governing Body, which should be organized and implemented in the light of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry; (ii) establish the bipartite and tripartite forums that this Committee has been calling for many years and that were called for once again by the Commission of Inquiry; and (iii) to immediately take all measures necessary to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific action taken in this regard.(e) Emphasizing once again that the absence of acts of harassment, stigmatization and intimidation and a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations are prerequisites for consultation processes, the Committee firmly urges the Government to immediately take all action necessary to establish an effective mechanism for tripartite consultations in accordance with the present conclusions. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific action taken in this regard.(f) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of progress on the above issues, which were also the subject of recommendations from the Commission of Inquiry. The Committee urges the Government to immediately take all the measures necessary to comply fully with the requirements made of it, in accordance with the process under way before the competent bodies of the Organization.(g) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communication of  March , the Government requested that the information sent by it to the Governing Body and the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations be brought to the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association, considering that the case is closely linked to the proceedings of the Committee of Inquiry which examined the non-observance of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), among other Conventions, and with a view to maintaining the necessary consistency among proceedings and avoiding a duplication of proceedings on the same case.
.The Committee recalls that, in the context of this case, it has been examining since  serious allegations of violations of freedom of association relating notably to: (i) acts of harassment, stigmatization and intimidation against employer leaders and their organizations, including acts of violence against them, and (ii) the marginalization and exclusion by the public authorities of the employers' organization, FEDECAMARAS, in decision-making processes, thus excluding social dialogue, tripartism and, in general, the holding of consultations regarding decision-making in economic and social matters.
.The Committee recalls that it observed with deep concern the Commission of Inquiry s finding and condemnation of a web of mechanisms and practices involving acts of violence, as well as impunity or lack of clarification of such acts; persecution and multiple forms of harassment of employers and trade unionists; practices of favouritism or promotion of parallel organizations and of discrimination against, replacement of and obstacles to the functioning of organizations that are not close to the Government; and the absence of tripartite consultation and exclusion from social dialogue (report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ). The Committee once again notes with concern that the above-mentioned ongoing process before the Governing Body reveals that the Government has not, to date, accepted the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry.
.The Committee observes that other general questions raised in this case are being examined by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations within the framework of the application of Convention No.  and as follow-up to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry.
.The Committee recalls that in its previous examination of the case, it recalled the conclusions of the  high-level tripartite mission and the conclusions and recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry, and its recommendations in the present case with respect to the allegations concerning social dialogue and tripartite consultation, indicated in paragraph  (d) and (e).
.The Committee notes the discussions held at the th, th and th Sessions of the Governing Body (March, June and October November ) and the information provided by the Government in this framework relating to the establishment and monitoring of the social dialogue forum to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry. In particular, the Committee notes that on  March , the inaugural session of the social dialogue forum was held, chaired by the Minister of People s Power for the Social Process of Labour (MPPPST), with the participation of other officials of the Ministry and the following employers' and workers' organizations: FEDECAMARAS, the Bolivarian Socialist Confederation of Men and Women Workers in Urban and Rural Areas and Fishing of Venezuela (CBST-CCP), the Venezuelan Federation of Craft, Micro, Small and Medium-sized Business Associations (FEDEINDUSTRIA) the Independent Trade Union Alliance Confederation of Workers (CTASI), the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CTV), the National Union of Workers of Venezuela (UNETE), the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions (CODESA); and with ILO technical assistance. During the session, the terms of reference were adopted for the social dialogue forum which include, for discussion, pending issues on the application of the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), Convention No.  and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ). The Committee also notes that between  and  April , the first in-person session of the forum was held, with the technical assistance of the Office, which resulted in the adoption of a plan of action involving a timetable of activities for",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
107,"the implementation of the Conventions mentioned. As follow-up to the forum, bilateral meetings were held with the social partners from  to  July , including FEDECAMARAS; and from  to  September , another session of the forum was held, with the technical assistance of the Office, at which the activities carried out as part of the implementation of the plan of action adopted in April were evaluated, and it was agreed to update the plan. The Committee notes that the third in-person session of the social dialogue forum was held on Margarita Island from  January to  February , with the participation of the MPPPST, FEDECAMARAS, FEDEINDUSTRIA, the CBST-CCP, the CTASI, the CTV and the CGT (report to the Governing Body at its th Session, GB./INS/(Rev.)). At that session, the participants agreed on various measures for the follow-up and updating of the plan of action, including strengthening relations between the National Land Institute (INTI) and FEDECAMARAS through meetings on the cases raised; strengthening actions to ensure the social dialogue process addresses the issues included in the Annex, holding bipartite meetings between the MPPPST and workers' and employers' organizations upon their request; and requesting ILO technical assistance on matters related to the implementation of the plan of action. The Committee notes that the plan of action adopted in the social dialogue forum, and its update, includes in its Annex, among other aspects relating to the above Conventions, the following expected results in connection with the case, as follow-up to the decisions of the Governing Body and relating to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry:
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee noted the first contact established between the legislature, through the Special Dialogue Commission, and FEDECAMARAS. The Committee also notes that, in its communication of  August  to the Governing Body, the Government indicated that the MPPPST was in the process of reaching agreement with the legislature, at the request of the social partners, on the participation of workers' and employers' organizations in the consultation phase of laws containing special arrangements on working conditions and the bill on workers with disabilities. It also noted the Government s indication that the associations and chambers of the production sectors headed by the Presidents of FEDECAMARAS and FEDEINDUSTRIA had been incorporated in the National Council on the Productive Economy at a new meeting of the Council, led by the President of the Republic. The Government indicated that the meeting was intended to devise strategies to strengthen the country s different production sectors. In this respect, the Committee notes that FEDECAMARAS, through a communication of  September  to the Governing Body, indicated that on  August , the President and other leading FEDECAMARAS officials were invited to the event of the National Council on the Productive Economy which included announcements on taxation and rates of collection and the Government s intention to develop a new diversified economic model which is less dependent on oil.
.The Committee also notes the communication transmitted by the Government on  December  to the Governing Body, following up on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry, in which the Government indicates that according to the work schedule of the plan of action updated in September , consultation activities with the social partners were planned, such as the adoption of the Regulations under the Constitutional Law of the Workers' Production Councils, on which it was expected to receive comments from employers' and workers' organizations; and lastly the minimum wage consultation for the second half of December . In this respect, the Committee notes that in the plan of action updated in the social dialogue forum in January February , annexed to the report to the Governing Body at its th Session, it was agreed to extend the deadline for the submission of comments on the above Regulations.
.The Committee also notes that in the above communication, the Government reported that in , within the framework of a broad and inclusive dialogue with all the country s employer sectors and partners, more than  round tables have been held with various economic sectors, citing the Exploratory and Trade Mission organized by the Federation of Traders of Colombia, with the participation of the Executive Vice President of the Republic and the institutional support of FEDECAMARAS ( November ). The Government also indicates that an event was held, organized by the Venezuelan Confederation of Industrialists (CONINDUSTRIA), a member organization of FEDECAMARAS concerning the  prospects of the Venezuelan industrial sector, with the participation of over one hundred employer associations, enterprises and chambers of the country.
.The Committee also notes the information provided by the Government to the Governing Body in its communication of  October , relating to the activities to implement the plan of action agreed in Caracas in September : (i) on  October , the public consultation was held with the employers' and workers' organizations on the Homeworkers' Act, in which the CBST-CCP, CTASI, CTV, CGT, FEDECAMARAS and FEDEINDUSTRIA participated; on  October , a meeting was held with FEDECAMARAS and FEDEINDUSTRIA to make progress in defining requirements and procedures for the national registration of those organizations, and a round table was set up at which the proposals presented by the social partners were discussed; and (iii) on  October , a tripartite meeting was held with the organizations affected by the results of the Social Dialogue Forum on the setting up of a round table relating to the application of Convention No. .
.While noting the information provided by the Government, the Committee also notes the communication from FEDECAMARAS to the Governing Body of  September , indicating that although meetings were held between the parties in a respectful and cordial atmosphere, the dialogue process is subject to delays and weaknesses, as no structured tripartite consultation body has been set up and the meetings do not comply with the formalities recommended by the Commission of Inquiry and other ILO supervisory bodies (independent chairperson or secretariat, recording of minutes, agreed timetable of meetings, follow-up mechanisms on compliance with agreements).
.In the light of the above, the Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on: (i) the specific results of the social dialogue forum, as follow-up to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry; and (ii) the measures taken to generate a climate of trust based on respect for employer and trade union organizations, with a view to promoting stable industrial relations. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific actions taken in this regard and as follow-up to the plan of action updated in the framework of the social dialogue forum.
.In addition, the Committee once again highlights the importance that the tripartite consultations that have been called for many years should: (i) be held by the executive branch within the scope of its powers; (ii) involve all representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS, regardless of their relations with the Government; and (iii) be effective and address all of the social and economic decisions likely to affect the interests of workers and employers. Emphasizing once again that the absence of acts of harassment, stigmatization and intimidation and a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations are prerequisites for consultation processes, the Committee firmly urges the Government to immediately take all action necessary to establish the said effective mechanism for tripartite consultations. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific action taken in this regard.
.The Committee recalls that it noted with great concern that the Commission of Inquiry expressed deep regret at the persistent and serious harassment of the representative action of FEDECAMARAS and its members and recommended the immediate cessation of all acts of violence, threats, persecution, stigmatization, intimidation or other forms of aggression against persons or organizations in relation to the exercise of legitimate employers' or trade union activities, and the adoption of measures to ensure that such acts do not recur in future (report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ()(i)).
.The Committee notes that, in two communications addressed to the Governing Body, FEDECAMARAS reports that: (i) it informed the Ministry of Labour of discrediting messages and unfounded accusations against FEDECAMARAS leaders, broadcast in a programme of the State channel on  April , in order to ensure that they are properly processed, as set out in the plan of action agreed during the social dialogue forum of April  (communication of  May ); and (ii) new hateful and intimidating messages ( and  August ) directed at the trade union organization from the National Assembly deputy for the state of Yaracuy, against the Presidents of FEDECAMARAS and the National Federation of Stockbreeders of Venezuela, as well as other trade union leaders as part of the restitution process of invaded lands (communication of  September ). The Committee notes that it has no information on the appropriate processing that should be performed of the",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
108,"allegations made by FEDECAMARAS in the communications dated  May and  September . The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the follow-up given to the treatment of the allegations of discrediting and intimidation presented by FEDECAMARAS in its communications to the Governing Body of  May and  September , in accordance with the plan of action agreed in the framework of the social dialogue forum.
.In the light of the findings and recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry, and of the measures taken in the framework of the plan of action adopted and updated in the social dialogue forum, the Committee once again strongly urges the Government to adopt all necessary measures to: (i) end immediately and prevent all acts of hostility and intimidation against FEDECAMARAS, so that it may exercise its representative activities in full freedom; (ii) ensure that the necessary foundations for genuine social dialogue in the country are established; and (iii) give effect to the measures set out in the plan of action agreed in a tripartite setting and updated in the social dialogue forum with a view to achieving the expected results defined in the plan of action. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific action taken in this regard.
.The Committee recalls that, in the present case, it has examined serious episodes of attacks on FEDECAMARAS leaders and on the organization s headquarters, in relation to which it has repeatedly requested that all of those responsible should be identified and punished and that the victims should receive compensation. The Committee recalls that it noted, in its previous examination of the case, the allegation of the abduction of and attack on Ms Albis Muoz and three further FEDECAMARAS leaders in , examined within the Commission of Inquiry, and that despite the time that had elapsed, several key elements of the offences had still not been clarified and that the corresponding judicial proceedings were still pending a final decision (see report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ; and th Report of the Committee, paras  and ). Further, the Committee recalls that with respect to the  attack on the ASOGATA headquarters, it noted with concern that the Commission of Inquiry: (i) noted that the attack took place the day after a peaceful protest organized by the association and that (ii) despite more than two years having passed between the events and the report of the Commission of Inquiry, there were still no defendants in the case; and (iii) considered that these elements provide sufficient grounds not to exclude the motive for the attack being related to the association s representative activities (report of the Commission of Inquiry, para.  and th Report of the Committee, para. ).
.Noting with great concern that the Government has not provided any new information on these cases since the publication of the report of the Commission of Inquiry, the Committee regrets to once again recall that in relation to cases of physical or verbal violence against workers and employers leaders and their organizations, the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union activities [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. In line with its previous recommendations and in accordance with the corresponding recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry, the Committee once again urges the Government and all competent authorities to take all necessary measures without delay to ensure that all of the instigators and perpetrators of the aforementioned attacks are identified and appropriately punished and to ensure that any compensation measures sought by the victims of those attacks are applied. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on progress made in this regard.
.The Committee recalls that, in the present case, it has examined serious allegations of the detention and prosecution of employers and leaders of representative organizations in various sectors. The Committee recalls that, in its previous examination of the case, it referred specifically in its conclusions and recommendations to the criminal investigations into the leaders of a meat processing company and a supermarket chain.
.The Committee notes that the Commission of Inquiry examined the aforementioned three cases, along with other allegations concerning similar situations (report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ). As regards the criminal investigations into leaders of a supermarket chain, in relation to which the Committee had requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the Prosecutor s Office s appeal against the judicial decision to close the investigations, the Committee notes that the Commission of Inquiry was informed that a judgement of the Court of Appeal on the matter was still pending. As regards the criminal investigations into the leaders of a meat processing company and a supermarket chain, reported in the context of this case, the Committee deeply regrets that, to date and despite the time that has lapsed, the Government has not provided information on the status of the legal proceedings concerned nor on the measures taken to implement the recommendations related to these allegations. The Committee therefore once again urges the competent authorities to: (i) make every effort to expedite the judicial proceedings that are still under way; and (ii) duly and fully take into account the employers' right to freely exercise their representative activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.Lastly, while welcoming the holding of the various sessions of the social dialogue forum and the measures agreed under the plan of action adopted and updated both in September  and February , the Committee encourages the Government to, in accordance with the process under way before the competent bodies of the Organization, continue to take all necessary measures without delay to fully comply with the requirements of the Commission of Inquiry.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on: (i) the specific results of the social dialogue forum, as follow-up to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry; (ii) the measures taken to generate a climate of trust based on respect for employer and trade union organizations with a view to promoting stable industrial relations; and (iii) the measures taken to ensure that the processes of dialogue and tripartite consultation comply with the formalities recommended by the Commission of Inquiry and other ILO supervisory bodies. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific actions taken in this regard and as follow-up to the plan of action updated in the framework of the social dialogue forum.(b) Emphasizing once again that the absence of acts of harassment, stigmatization and intimidation and a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations are prerequisites for consultation processes, the Committee firmly urges the Government to immediately take all action necessary to establish the said effective mechanism for tripartite consultations in accordance with the information laid out in the present conclusions. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific action taken in this regard.(c) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the follow-up given to the treatment of the allegations of discrediting and intimidation presented by FEDECAMARAS in its communications to the Governing Body of  May and  September  and in accordance with the plan of action agreed in the framework of the social dialogue forum.(d) The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to adopt all necessary measures to: (i) end immediately and prevent all acts of hostility and intimidation against FEDECAMARAS, so that it may exercise its representative activities in full freedom; (ii) ensure that the necessary foundations for genuine social dialogue in the country are established; and (iii) give effect to the measures agreed in the plan of action agreed in a tripartite setting and updated in the social dialogue forum with a view to achieving the expected results defined in the plan of action. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific action taken in this regard.(e) The Committee once again urges the Government and all competent authorities to take all necessary measures without delay to ensure that all of the instigators and perpetrators of the attacks examined in this case are identified and appropriately punished and to ensure that any compensation measures sought by the victims of those attacks are applied. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on progress made in this regard.(f) As regards the criminal investigations into the leaders of a meat processing company and a supermarket chain, the Committee once again urges the competent authorities to: (i) make every effort to expedite the judicial proceedings that are still under way; and (ii) duly and",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(g) The Committee encourages the Government to, in accordance with the process under way before the competent bodies of the Organization, continue to take all necessary measures without delay to fully comply with the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of specific measures adopted to comply with the plan of action agreed in the social dialogue forum regarding the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry and the decisions of the Governing Body, and relating to this case.(h) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its October  session and on that occasion presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (October November )].
.FEDECAMARAS submitted further allegations in a communication of  April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  May .
.The Committee recalls that it suspended its consideration of this case after its last examination, in the light of the complaint made under article  of the ILO Constitution by various Employers' delegates to the th Session of the International Labour Conference against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the decision of the Governing Body to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to examine the country s non-observance of the Freedom of Association Convention,  (No. ), among other Conventions. The Governing Body took note of the report of the Commission of Inquiry at its th Session (October November ). The Committee observes that the Commission of Inquiry established in its report that, in the light of the gravity of the issues raised, the situation and the progress achieved on its recommendations should be the subject of active supervision by the ILO supervisory bodies concerned. The Committee also observes that several of the pending recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry concern matters raised in Case No. , the examination of which may now be reactivated. In its rd Report (March , paragraph ), in the light of the gravity and persistence of the matters involved in this case, the Committee requested the Government to send its observations in relation to its previous recommendations and in the light of the relevant recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry so that it might pursue its examination of the case in full knowledge of the facts.
.At its October  session, the Committee made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a) Deploring the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, the Committee insists on the urgency of the Government taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b) As regards the abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), the Committee once again urges the Government to send a copy of the ruling by which the accused was sentenced and to state whether other people were charged (providing information on any related proceedings and the outcome thereof). The Committee also requests the Government to inform it of the status and possible outcome of any complaint or judicial proceedings (sending a copy of any relevant ruling) relating to the granting of compensation to FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned for the damage caused by these illegal acts. As regards the February  bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee again insists that the Government send its observations on the points raised by FEDECAMARAS and, in particular, on the outcome of the appeal against the closing of the case and on any investigation carried out in order to determine whether anyone else was involved in the attack, and thus to shed light on its motive and to prevent any recurrence.(c) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue that need to be established in the country; the plan of action to be established in consultation with the social partners with stages and specific time frames for implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body; and the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee deeply deplores the lack of information and further progress in this regard. It recalls that the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission conducted in  refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee also recalls that at its March  session, in examining the complaint presented under article  of the ILO Constitution against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela alleging non-compliance with Conventions Nos ,  and , the Governing Body urged the Government to institutionalize without delay a tripartite round table, with the presence of the ILO, to foster social dialogue for the resolution of all pending issues, including matters relating to the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders. The Committee insists once again on the urgency of the Government adopting immediately tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission and the Governing Body. Deeply deploring once again that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee once again urges it to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon.(d) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, again urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee urges the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard.(e) As regards the criminal investigations concerning the meat processing company, the Committee urges the Government not merely to give an indication of general criminal offences but to indicate the specific allegations against each of the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities and to provide precise information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings. Furthermore, the Committee requests the competent authorities to consider lifting or replacing the only preventive detention measure in the framework of those investigations. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the Prosecutor s Office s appeal against the judicial decision to close the criminal investigations concerning the supermarket chain. In relation to allegations of assault and detention of leaders and shareholders of a consortium of credit card transaction companies, the Committee invites the complainant organizations to provide any additional information at their disposal and requests the Government to send a detailed reply in the light of such information, indicating the specific allegations against each of the persons under investigation or trial and to provide information on the progress and status of the judicial proceedings concerned.(f) The Committee firmly urges that full consultations on draft legislation covering labour, economic or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members be held without delay with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, including FEDECAMARAS.(g) The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures, including the repeal or reform of regulations or legislation with a view to eliminating any institutions or provisions established or promoted by public authorities ' including the WPBs or other bodies such as the General Staff of the Working Class and the Labour Feminist Brigades ' which may supplant independent trade union organizations or interfere in the freedom of negotiation between independent organizations of workers and of employers. In view of the fact that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified Conventions Nos  and , the Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) and requests the Government to keep the CEACR informed of any measures taken in this regard.(h) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
110,"on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(i) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In a communication of  April  submitted by the IOE, FEDECAMARAS states that: (i) FEDECAMARAS is the subject of continued hostile messages from the highest state authorities, as evidenced by the televised statements of the President of the Republic on  April  claiming that the organization is engaging in conspiracy schemes; (ii) no social dialogue forum has been established or convened in line with point  under paragraph  of the Commission of Inquiry s report, as required by subparagraph (b) of the Governing Body s decision of March  (GB//INS/ (Rev. )); and (iii) no further meetings have been held with representatives of the Ministry of Popular Power for the Social Process of Labour.
.In a communication of  May  and considering the case to be implicit within the complaint made in  by Employers' delegates to the International Labour Conference, the Government, seeking to maintain the necessary coherence and coordination between proceedings, submitted to the Committee its communications on the follow-up to the report of the Commission of Inquiry and the reports sent to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations on compliance with the Conventions that are the subject of the aforementioned complaint.
.The Committee recalls that, since , it has been examining under this case serious allegations of violation of freedom of association concerning in particular: (i) acts of harassment, stigmatization and intimidation towards employers' leaders and their organizations, including acts of violence against them, and (ii) the public authorities' marginalization and exclusion of the employers' organization FEDECAMARAS from decision-making processes, thereby excluding social dialogue, tripartism and, more generally, consultations on the adoption of social and economic decisions.
.The Committee takes note of the report of the Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Governing Body to examine allegations of non-observance by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of Convention No. , among other Conventions, which was adopted on  September . The Committee notes that many matters in the present case were examined by the Commission of Inquiry, which after a detailed examination confirmed a number of the concerns raised by the Committee in the present case. In this respect, the Committee observes with great concern the Commission s finding and condemnation of a web of mechanisms and practices involving acts of violence, as well as impunity or lack of clarification of such acts; persecution and multiple forms of harassment of employers and trade unionists; practices of favouritism or promotion of parallel organizations and of discrimination against, replacement of and obstacles to the functioning of organizations that are not close to the Government; and the absence of tripartite consultation and exclusion from social dialogue (report of the Commission of Inquiry, paragraph ). The Committee also notes that the ongoing procedure before the Governing Body shows that the Government has thus far not accepted the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry.
.Duly noting the fact that the Commission of Inquiry indicated that the situation and the progress achieved on its recommendations should be the subject of active supervision by the ILO supervisory bodies concerned, the Committee will pursue its examination of the present case in the light of the conclusions and recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry.
.The Committee recalls that, in the present case, it is examining numerous allegations of stigmatization and intimidation by the authorities or Bolivarian groups and organizations against FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated bodies, leaders and affiliated enterprises. In this respect, the Committee notes with great concern that the Commission of Inquiry expressed deep regret at the persistent and serious harassment of the representative action of FEDECAMARAS and its members and recommended the immediate cessation of all acts of violence, threats, persecution, stigmatization, intimidation or other forms of aggression against persons or organizations in relation to the exercise of legitimate employers' or trade union activities, and the adoption of measures to ensure that such acts do not recur in future (report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ()(i)).
.The Committee notes that, in a communication of  December  to the Governing Body concerning the receipt of the report of the Commission of Inquiry, the Government continues to deny the existence of such acts of harassment. The Committee also notes that both in a communication of  March  to the Governing Body and in its communication of  April , FEDECAMARAS reports that the organization had received further hostile messages from the highest state authorities.
.Deploring the continuing serious situation of harassment it has noted since its first examination of the case in , the Committee regrets that it must recall once again that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. In the light of the conclusions and recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry, the Committee once again firmly urges the Government to adopt all measures necessary to end immediately all acts of hostility and intimidation against FEDECAMARAS, so that it may exercise its representative activities in full freedom, and to ensure that the necessary foundations for genuine social dialogue in the country are established. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on specific action taken in this regard.
.The Committee recalls that, in the present case, it has examined serious episodes of attacks on FEDECAMARAS leaders and on the organization s headquarters, in relation to which it has repeatedly recommended that all of those responsible should be identified and punished and that the victims should receive compensation. The Committee recalls in particular that: (i) the abduction of and attack on Ms Albis Muoz and three further FEDECAMARAS leaders in  and the attack on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters in  resulted in repeated recommendations of the Committee (recommendation (b) of the Committee s last report) and (ii) moreover, the attack on the headquarters of the Tchira State Stockbreeders Association (ASOGATA) in February  was reported by the complainants in the context of this case in May .
.The Committee observes that the Commission of Inquiry examined specifically the three attacks mentioned in the previous paragraph. As regards the attacks on Ms Muoz and three further FEDECAMARAS leaders and the attack on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee observes that, on the basis of all of the information received, which matches the evidence examined by the Committee in the present case, the Commission of Inquiry noted that, despite the time that had elapsed, several key elements of the offences had still not been clarified and that the corresponding judicial proceedings were still pending a final decision (report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ).
.As regards the  attack on the ASOGATA headquarters, the Committee notes with concern that the Commission of Inquiry: (i) noted that the attack took place the day after a peaceful protest organized by the association and that (ii) despite more than two years having passed between the events and the report of the Commission of Inquiry, there were still no defendants in the case; and (iii) considered that these elements provide sufficient grounds not to exclude the motive for the attack being related to the association s representative activities (report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ).
.Observing with great concern that the Government has not provided any new information on these cases since the publication of the report of the Commission of Inquiry, the Committee recalls once again that the absence of judgments against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights [see Compilation, para. ]. In line with its previous recommendations and in accordance with the corresponding recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry, the Committee therefore once again urges the Government and all competent authorities to take all necessary measures without delay to ensure that all of the instigators and perpetrators of the aforementioned attacks are identified and appropriately punished and to ensure that any compensation measures sought by the victims of the attacks are applied. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on progress made in this regard.
.The Committee recalls that, in the present case, it has examined serious allegations of the detention and prosecution of employers and leaders of representative organizations in various sectors. The Committee recalls that, in its last examination of the case, it referred specifically in its conclusions and recommendations to the criminal investigations into the leaders of a meat processing company, a supermarket chain and a consortium of credit card transaction companies (recommendation (e) of the Committee s",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
111,"last report).
.The Committee observes that the Commission of Inquiry examined the aforementioned three cases, along with other allegations concerning similar situations (report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ). As regards the criminal investigations into leaders of a credit card consortium, the Committee notes that the Commission of Inquiry was informed of the closure of the corresponding proceedings. In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation. As regards the criminal investigations into leaders of a supermarket chain, in relation to which the Committee had requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the Prosecutor s Office s appeal against the judicial decision to close the investigations, the Committee notes that the Commission of Inquiry was informed that a judgment of the Court of Appeal on the matter was still pending.
.As regards the criminal investigations into the leaders of a meat processing company, the Committee recalls that it had requested further information on the specific allegations against each of the people under investigation and precise information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings, and had requested the competent authorities to consider lifting or replacing the only preventive detention measure in force. The Committee notes in this regard that the Commission of Inquiry was informed by the Government that: (i) a final indictment had been served against Ms Tania Salinas and Ms Delia Rivas for committing the offences of speculation, boycott, fraudulently misrepresenting the quality of goods, price rigging and selling expired foodstuffs and goods, all under the Basic Fair Pricing Act, and criminal association, under the Penal Code; (ii) the case was still awaiting a preliminary hearing, since on  September  an arrest warrant had been issued for Ms Salinas after she escaped from hospital; and (iii) alternative precautionary measures, and other unspecified measures (freezing of bank accounts) had been imposed on Angelly Lpez, Yolman Valderrama and Ernesto Arenas.
.While noting with concern the Commission of Inquiry s conclusions on the situation of other employers' leaders (report of the Commission of Inquiry, paras  et seq.), in relation to the criminal proceedings initiated against certain leaders of a meat processing company and a supermarket chain that were reported in the context of the current case, the Committee urges the competent authorities to: (i) make every effort to expedite the judicial proceedings that are still under way and (ii) duly and fully take into account the employers' right to freely exercise their representative activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Committee recalls that, on the basis of the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission of  that were endorsed by the Governing Body, it has been urging the Government for several years to: (i) establish structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue and a plan of action, with a view to resolving all outstanding matters, including issues relating to the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders and (ii) take action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations (recommendations (c) and (d) of the previous examination of the case).
.The Committee observes that the Commission of Inquiry noted with concern the favouritism towards organizations that are close to the Government in relation to dialogue and consultation, and the exclusion or unequal treatment of representative organizations, in particular FEDECAMARAS, for the mere fact of not being close to the Government (report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ). On that basis, the Commission of Inquiry recommended the creation and convocation in the very near future of various dialogue round-tables, including: (i) a round-table for tripartite dialogue which includes all representative organizations and (ii) a round-table for dialogue between the authorities concerned and FEDECAMARAS on questions relating to that organization, such as land seizure (report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ()).
.The Committee notes that, in a communication of  February  to the Governing Body, the Government indicates that: (i) dialogue forums were recently established with various employers' and workers' organizations of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, one of which included FEDECAMARAS and (ii) it is planned to continue with the dialogue forums on a regular basis.
.The Committee also notes that, in a communication of  March  to the Governing Body, FEDECAMARAS indicates that, although it participated in two meetings with the Ministry of Popular Power for the Social Process of Labour (on  February and  March ), the dialogue forum intended in the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry has not yet been established. FEDECAMARAS refers in this connection to the importance of the dialogue forum being chaired by an independent person who has the trust of the parties, of the workers' organizations participating on the basis of plurality and in particular of ensuring an atmosphere free of intimidation and harassment. In this regard, the Committee recalls that it is important that consultations take place in good faith, confidence and mutual respect, and that the parties have sufficient time to express their views and discuss them in full with a view to reaching a suitable compromise. The Government must also ensure that it attaches the necessary importance to agreements reached between workers' and employers' organizations [see Compilation, para. ].
.In addition, the Committee notes that, in its decision of March  on the Government s reply to the report of the Commission of Inquiry (decision GB//INS/ (Rev. )), the Governing Body urged the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to establish and convene, by May , a social dialogue forum, in line with point  under paragraph  of the Commission of Inquiry s report. In this respect, the Committee notes that, in its communication of  April , FEDECAMARAS states that: (i) the social dialogue forum called for by the Governing Body has not been established or convened and (ii) no further meetings have been held with representative of the Ministry of Popular Power for the Social Process of Labour. Furthermore, the Committee notes that, in an additional communication sent on  April  to the Director-General pursuant to the decision of the Governing Body on the measures taken to follow up on the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry, the Government states that: (i) dialogue forums with employers' and workers' organizations on the ILO Conventions covered by the Commission of Inquiry and on other issues have continued to be organized, in a climate of consultation; (ii) it plans to organize in May a major forum for social dialogue that is broad, inclusive and without privileges, involving all representative organizations of employers and workers that wish to participate in it in a way that is sincere, constructive and unconnected with political interests; and (iii) it is open to suggestions from the ILO on the organization of this forum.
.While duly noting the information provided by the Government to the Governing Body and, in particular, the isolated meetings organized with FEDECAMARAS in February and March , the Committee finds it deeply regrettable that the Commission of Inquiry s recommendations on social dialogue, which are in line with the repeated recommendations issued by the various supervisory bodies of the ILO, including this Committee, for many years, have still not been implemented. Emphasizing once again the fundamental importance of tripartite dialogue as a means of finding solutions to problems arising in the context of labour relations [see Compilation, para. ] and noting the Government s stated intention to organize a major dialogue forum in May, the Committee firmly urges the Government to: (i) provide detailed information on the outcomes of the social dialogue forum called for by the Governing Body, which should be organized and implemented in the light of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry; (ii) establish the bipartite and tripartite forums that this Committee has been calling for many years and that were called for once again by the Commission of Inquiry; and (iii) to immediately take all measures necessary to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific action taken in this regard.
.The Committee recalls that as part of its recommendations on social dialogue, it has been urging the Government for many years to hold without delay full consultations with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, including FEDECAMARAS, on draft legislation covering labour, economic or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members (recommendation (f) of the Committee s last report on this case).
.The Committee observes with concern that, in its report, the Commission of Inquiry noted the persistent exclusion of FEDECAMARAS from consultation processes. The Committee notes that, in line with the recommendations that have been issued for many years by this Committee and the other supervisory bodies of the ILO, the",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
112,"Commission of Inquiry recommended the establishment of effective tripartite consultation procedures covering the subjects envisaged in all ratified ILO Conventions (report of the Commission of Inquiry, paragraph ()). In this regard, the Committee has drawn the attention of governments to the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law. The Committee also considers that a forum for social dialogue shall be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations [see Compilation, paras  and ].
.The Committee notes that, in its communication of  February  to the Governing Body, the Government indicates that FEDECAMARAS is holding meetings directly with the Special Commission for Dialogue, Peace and National Reconciliation of the National Assembly ( the Special Commission for Dialogue'  and thus the priorities and aspirations expressed by FEDECAMARAS will be able to be channelled by the legislature. In this respect, the Committee notes that, in its communication of  March  to the Governing Body, FEDECAMARAS: (i) refers to the meeting on  January  with the Special Commission for Dialogue in which it was agreed that the representative organization would send the Special Commission the proposals that it considered most urgent and (ii) indicates that it sent those proposals on  February , including a request that the Special Commission for Dialogue exercise its good offices to urge and facilitate before the National Executive the formal establishment of the tripartite forum recommended by the Commission of Inquiry. The Committee also notes that, in their communications of  April and  May , respectively, to the Director-General pursuant to the decision of the Governing Body on the measures taken to comply with the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry: (i) the Government states that formal consultations have begun with workers' and employers' organizations on minimum wage-fixing machinery and (ii) FEDECAMARAS states that the Government approved a minimum wage increase on  May , that FEDECAMARAS was requested one day beforehand by official letter to communicate its observations on the increase, and that the sending of the letter cannot be considered as a meaningful consultation.
.While duly noting the initial contact established between the legislature through the Special Commission for Dialogue and FEDECAMARAS, the Committee recalls that it has emphasized the vital importance that it attaches to social dialogue and tripartite consultation, not only concerning questions of labour law but also in the formulation of public policy on labour, social and economic matters [see Compilation, para. ]. In the light of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry and of its own previous recommendations in this regard, the Committee highlights the importance that the tripartite consultations that have been called for many years should: (i) be held by the executive branch within the scope of its powers; (ii) involve all representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS, regardless of their relations with the Government; and (iii) be effective and address all of the social and economic decisions likely to affect the interests of workers and employers. Emphasizing once again that the absence of acts of harassment, stigmatization and intimidation and a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations are prerequisites for consultation processes, the Committee firmly urges the Government to immediately take all action necessary to establish the said effective mechanism for tripartite consultations. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific action taken in this regard.
.The Committee expresses deep concern at the lack of progress on the aforementioned points, which are also the subject of recommendations by the Commission of Inquiry. The Committee also notes the Government s express rejection of decision GB//INS/ (Rev. ) of the Governing Body. The Committee urges the Government to immediately take all measures necessary to comply fully with all of the requirements made of it, in accordance with the process under way before the competent bodies of the Organization.
.In the light of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee once again firmly urges the Government to adopt all measures necessary to end immediately all acts of hostility and intimidation against FEDECAMARAS so that it may exercise its representative activities in full freedom, and to ensure that the necessary foundations for genuine social dialogue in the country are established. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on specific action taken in this regard.(b) The Committee once again urges the Government and all competent authorities to take all necessary measures without delay to ensure that all of the instigators and perpetrators of the attacks examined in the present case are identified and appropriately punished and to ensure that any compensation measures sought by the victims of the attacks are applied. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on progress made in this regard.(c) In relation to the criminal proceedings initiated against certain leaders of a meat processing company and a supermarket chain, the Committee urges the competent authorities to: (i) make every effort to expedite the judicial proceedings that are still under way and (ii) duly and fully take into account the employers' right to freely exercise their representative activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d) The Committee firmly urges the Government to: (i) provide detailed information on the outcomes of the social dialogue forum called for by the Governing Body, which should be organized and implemented in the light of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry; (ii) establish the bipartite and tripartite forums that this Committee has been calling for many years and that were called for once again by the Commission of Inquiry; and (iii) to immediately take all measures necessary to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific action taken in this regard.(e) Emphasizing once again that the absence of acts of harassment, stigmatization and intimidation and a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations are prerequisites for consultation processes, the Committee firmly urges the Government to immediately take all action necessary to establish an effective mechanism for tripartite consultations in accordance with the present conclusions. The Committee expects to receive information from the Government without delay on the specific action taken in this regard.(f) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of progress on the above issues, which were also the subject of recommendations from the Commission of Inquiry. The Committee urges the Government to immediately take all the measures necessary to comply fully with the requirements made of it, in accordance with the process under way before the competent bodies of the Organization.(g) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its May June  session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see nd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ), paras ' ].
.The complainant organizations presented new allegations in a communication dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication received on  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following interim recommendations regarding the allegations presented by the complainant organizations [see nd Report, para. ]:(a) While once again expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, the Committee insists on the urgency of the Government taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b) As regards the abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), the Committee urges the Government to send a copy of the ruling by which one of the accused was sentenced and to state whether other people were charged (providing information on any",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
113,"related proceedings and the outcome thereof) and whether FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned received compensation for the damage caused by these illegal acts. As regards the February  bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee again insists that the Government send its observations on the points raised by FEDECAMARAS and, in particular, on the outcome of the appeal against the closing of the case and on any investigation carried out in order to determine whether anyone else was involved in the attack, and thus to shed light on its motive and to prevent any recurrence.(c) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue that need to be established in the country, the plan of action to be established in consultation with the social partners with stages and specific time frames for implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, and the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee deeply deplores the lack of information and further progress in this regard. It recalls that the conclusions of the mission refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee also recalls that at its March  session, in examining the complaint presented under article  of the ILO Constitution against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela alleging non-compliance with Conventions Nos ,  and , the Governing Body urged the Government to institutionalize without delay a tripartite round table, with the presence of the ILO, to foster social dialogue for the resolution of all pending issues, including matters relating to the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders. The Committee insists on the urgency of the Government adopting immediately tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission and the Governing Body. Deeply deploring that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee once again urges it to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon.(d) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, again urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee urges the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard.(e) The Committee, having noted the Government s observations concerning the allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors, deeply deplores that once again a full answer has not been provided in relation to the individuals who are the subject of investigation procedures. As regards the cases of the meat processing company and the supermarket chain, the Committee urges the Government not merely to give an indication of general criminal offences but to indicate the specific allegations against each of the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities and to provide precise information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings. Furthermore, in the case of the meat processing company, the Committee urges the Government to state whether these employers and leaders have been subjected to precautionary or detention measures and again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on them.(f) As regards the adoption by the President of the Republic of numerous decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, deeply deploring that the Government has not made any observations concerning their impact on social dialogue and the persistent nature of this situation, the Committee firmly urges that full consultations on draft legislation covering labour, economic or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members be held without delay with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS.(g) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(h) The Committee will examine the new allegations, made by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS and the reply of the Government thereto at its next meeting and requests the Government to send further relevant observations in this respect.(i) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In their communication of  May , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS denounce new violations of the principles of freedom of association and the absence of effective social dialogue. The complainants denounce that spokespersons for or linked to the Government have continued to attack FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and the business sector. They provided numerous examples of unsubstantiated and intimidating accusations and threats made through the media by, among others, the Deputy Chairperson of the government party ' a member of parliament who was appointed to the Government as co-leader of the National Anti-Coup Committee for Peace and Sovereignty ' and the President of the Republic himself. The complainants also denounce attacks on the employers' sector by government authorities, including threats of imprisonment, assaults, arrests of leaders, employees and shareholders, accusing them of corruption or economic destabilization and subjecting them to public ridicule without guaranteeing due process and their right of defence: they refer, in particular, to the imposition of orders to reduce prices (with detention of employees) and confiscation of goods (combined with threats to initiate criminal proceedings against the President of FEDECAMARAS, alleging that the latter described one of the cases of confiscation as theft, which is untrue); looting in the stores of the State of Bolvar, and the detention and referral for trial before the military courts of representatives of the leading credit card transaction company, in relation to faults in the operation of the system (accusing them of treason); and arbitrary measures against bakeries with the support of the security forces (without respecting the right of defence and resulting in the occupation of some bakeries).
.The complainant organizations also denounce the absence of effective dialogue and reiterate that the dialogue processes which the Government had announced before the Governing Body of the ILO have not been put in place (neither the action plan that provided for social dialogue nor the inclusion of FEDECAMARAS in a socio-economic dialogue round table have taken place). The complainants denounce that FEDECAMARAS has been excluded through new governmental measures having an impact on business performance and undermining freedom of association. In this regard, the complainants referred to the approval, without consultation, of the purchase from farmers of  per cent of agro-industrial production for use by local supply and production committees. The complainants also denounce the creation, without consultation, of the Workers' Production Boards (WPBs), with three employees' representatives from the enterprise and four from the State, which constitutes an additional mechanism for state interference (as these are subject to the guidelines of the Government, with the presence and support of the armed forces). The complainants further pointed out that among the representatives of the State, one belongs to the Bolivarian Armed Forces, one to the Bolivarian militias, one is a youth representative and one belongs to the National Women s Union. The complainants denounce the presentation of the WPBs by the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MPPPST), according to which the WPBs have been conceived as a civil ilitary union for the professional, technical and political training of workers and they must have the support of all trade union organizations. The complainants refer to Decree No.  of  November  on the creation of the WPBs, issued under the state of emergency for economic hardship. The complainants further denounce the creation of the General Staff of the Working Class (a government organization to strengthen the WPBs) and the Labour Feminist Brigades (a body to promote control of the entire social process of work in each company), as well as other strategies for using the country s labour movement in support of the Government and against employers, in violation of freedom of association. In addition to these bodies, the complainants referred to the complex structure of highly politicized state organizations with which companies must interact (including various supervisory bodies such as the National Superintendence for the Defence of Socio-economic Rights) thereby limiting the freedom of action of employers and workers, making it virtually impossible for enterprises to conduct normal business activities and rendering ineffective the exercise of freedom of association. The complainants also stressed that heavy state intervention and interference limit the operational capacity of employers and have led to a decrease in the number of enterprises and the consequent loss of decent jobs ' largely because of the absence of social dialogue with the most representative actors in the country in relation to the adoption of",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
114,"macroeconomic measures and of policies that ensure the sustainability of enterprises and jobs. The complainants further denounce that another economic emergency decree was enacted on  September  (and, once again, its wording is part of the Government s campaign to stigmatize the business and trade union sectors ' attributing the poverty suffered by the Venezuelan population to an economic war allegedly waged by certain sectors of the national economy ' including repressive measures against the employers), as well as the approval, without consultation, of increases in the minimum wage and the cestaticket (food voucher) in January and April  and February , respectively.
.The complainants allege that notwithstanding the fact that written communications were exchanged and meetings held between FEDECAMARAS and the MPPPST (specifically, on  and  January and  April ), these meetings, which were held in a climate of institutional respect, were purely formal in nature, did not take place within structured dialogue mechanisms or in a climate of sufficient trust between the parties to support the realization of effective dialogue and were carried out simultaneously with the aforementioned intimidating attacks on FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated organizations and its leaders, adding that the invitations to attend these meetings were couched in intimidating terms by the Minister in the media. The complainants further state that: (i) although the MPPPST admitted at the meeting of  January  that the consultation regarding the increase in the minimum wage in January  had been omitted and that, by a letter of  February , FEDECAMARAS had been requested to express its views on the policy of minimum wage increases (to which FEDECAMARAS responded on  February ), on  February, the increase impacting the food benefits was published without due tripartite consultation; and (ii) although at the meeting held on  April  the Minister asked for suggestions regarding the following salary increase, FEDECAMARAS was unable to express specific considerations or participate in an effective dialogue thereon because the MPPPST did not transmit to it any specific terms or elements regarding the increase under consideration and, again, an increase in the minimum wage was adopted on  April  without tripartite consultation. Despite this, FEDECAMARAS reiterates once again its general complaints that isolated wage increases do not solve the problem of the workers' loss of purchasing power and that comprehensive measures are required. Finally, the complainants point out, in relation to the National Council on the Productive Economy, that while it is possible that one of its chambers of commerce or employers might participate in a meeting on a one-time basis, FEDECAMARAS as an institution is still not a member of the aforementioned Council.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government had provided its observations replying to the allegations of the complainant organizations of  May . Regarding the allegations of intimidating attacks on FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated organizations and its leaders, the Government referred to the information it provided to the Governing Body during its th Session (March ). Furthermore, in its observations, the Government affirmed that: (i) the various measures that allegedly constituted attacks on various business sectors were not arbitrary and were carried out in accordance with the law and with the goal of protecting the population (in relation to allegations of arrests and intimidation of leaders and shareholders of a consortium of credit card transaction companies, the Government indicates that upon proof that faults in the electronic payment platform had been deliberately caused as a form of financial sabotage, the competent authorities proceeded to arrest the perpetrators, and that it was in no way an act of intimidation against Venezuelan businessmen); (ii) the purchase of  per cent of agro-industrial production was carried out in accordance with the constitutional mandate to ensure the availability of commodities within the context of economic warfare and the creation of WPBs was carried out to promote the participation of the working class in the management of production, without replacing or opposing the trade union organization; and (iii) the increase in the cestaticket (food voucher) was the result of its natural annual adjustment and the MPPPST had asked FEDECAMARAS, in its communication dated  February , to submit its proposals concerning the salary increase that was customary for Labour Day. The replies, received from FEDECAMARAS on  and  April , did not contain any concrete proposals.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government sent its observations concerning the aforementioned recommendations of the Committee.
.Concerning recommendation (a), the Government once again denies that FEDECAMARAS, its affiliates or its leaders have been persecuted, pressured, threatened or subjected to any act of violence as a result of their condition and exercise of trade union activity. The Government alleges that it has not refused to recognize FEDECAMARAS as one of the most representative employers' organizations. The Government argues that, however, while at the international level FEDECAMARAS wishes to legitimize its status as a representative organization of employers, at the national level it acts as a political organization in opposition to the legitimately elected Government. The Government submits that the acquiescence of FEDECAMARAS with regard to the destabilizing political activities that have been taking place in the country since April  was clear and evident, in an attempt to disregard the institutional framework and forcefully put an end to the established constitutional order, ignoring the democratically elected authorities. It also alleges that FEDECAMARAS made public calls to suspend the election process of the National Constituent Assembly on  July . Based on these arguments, the Government once again requests the Committee to stop examining these matters, which it considers to fall outside its scope, and that particular political interests should no longer be allowed to be used in the campaign of attacks against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.With regard to recommendation (b) of its previous examination of the case, the Government reiterates that since September , by virtue of a final ruling, which is currently being enforced, the perpetrator of the acts that took place in  against the representatives of FEDECAMARAS was sentenced to  years and eight months' imprisonment. The Government indicates that the facts in question were chance acts completely unrelated to the trade union status of the affected persons, and therefore requests the Committee to refrain from further examining this matter. As regards the granting of compensation to FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned in the case, the Government indicates that it will act to the extent appropriate and where so determined by a final judicial ruling.
.With regard to recommendations (c) and (d) of its previous consideration of the case, the Committee notes that the Government emphasizes its commitment to advancing consensus and dialogue in maintaining peace. The Government emphasizes that FEDECAMARAS has been invited by the highest Governmental bodies to join the honest and politically disinterested dialogue at a time when individual economic and political interests, both internal and external, attempt to ignore the institutional framework and the rule of law in the country. In this regard, the Government transmits its response to the communication of  August  from FEDECAMARAS (reporting on the appointment of the new Management Committee of this organization), in which the MPPPST welcomed the suggestion of dialogue made by FEDECAMARAS in its letter. In this letter of reply, the Minister calls on FEDECAMARAS to deal without distractions with the contribution of the business sector in this process, as well as to renounce individual and political interests that have historically been used to justify actions contrary to the Constitution and the laws of the Republic (also inviting FEDECAMARAS to condemn any action, internal or external, that contributes to the destabilization of the country or attempts to infringe on national sovereignty). The Government indicates that the National Constituent Assembly having been formed, the invitation for FEDECAMARAS to participate remains open, free of demands and agendas. Nevertheless, the Government reports that, unfortunately, FEDECAMARAS refuses to recognize the full powers of the National Constituent Assembly and has disregarded the Government s efforts to engage in direct and honest bipartite dialogue.
.The Government also recalls that, previously, at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in June , the Minister of MPPPST requested the support of the Director-General to hold a tripartite meeting at ILO headquarters in the presence of his representatives, in addition to the representatives of FEDECAMARAS and the Bolivarian Socialist Confederation of Urban, Rural and Fisheries Workers (CBST), as the most representative employers' and workers' organizations in the country. The Government indicates that, unfortunately, FEDECAMARAS, ignoring, with a hint of arrogance, the CBST as the most representative workers' organization and claiming that it has political ties with the Government, coupled with the destabilizing situation that was emerging in the country at that time, decided not to attend the meeting a few minutes before its commencement. The Government emphasizes that this attitude is at odds with FEDECAMARAS' continual and constant requests to the ILO for technical assistance for the implementation of social dialogue with the Government.
.With regard to recommendation (e)",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
115,"of its previous examination of the case, the Government provides, in relation to the case of the meat processing company, the following information on the criminal investigations initiated: (i) in March , charges were filed against Ms Tania Carolina Salinas Rebolledo and Ms Delia Isabel Rivas Colina in relation to the commission of the crimes of speculation, boycotting, fraudulently misrepresenting the quality of goods, price rigging, selling expired foodstuffs and criminal conspiracy; these persons are currently waiting for the relevant preliminary hearing to be held while their bank accounts have been suspended and frozen as a result of a provisional injunction granted at the national level; (ii) Ms Delia Isabel Rivas Colina, as well as Ms Anllerlin Guadalupe Lpez Graterol, Mr Yolman Javier Valderrama and Mr Ernesto Luis Arenad Pulgar are subject to precautionary measures alternative to imprisonment; and (iii) a preventive detention measure was imposed on Ms Tania Carolina Salinas Rebolledo (who is a fugitive from justice). Regarding the supermarket chain, the Government reports that: (i) in May  charges were brought against Mr Manuel Andrs Morales Ordosgoitti and Mr Tadeo Arriechi Franco for the commission of the crimes of boycotting and destabilization of the economy; (ii) in November , the competent court replaced the detention of accused persons with alternative precautionary measures; (iii) on  January  the preliminary hearing was held and the court ordered the closing of the case (and consequently the cessation of the precautionary measures ordered); and (iv) the Public Prosecutors' Office filed an appeal against the decision ordering the closing of the case on  January .
.With regard to recommendation (f) of its previous consideration of the case, the Government indicates that, as the ILO is aware, the Government has conducted consultations and convened meetings on the issue of wages and other labour matters with the participation of workers' and employers' organizations (including FEDECAMARAS and its affiliated organizations) but FEDECAMARAS has refused to take part in those consultations and meetings and has ignored this dialogue, acting in a way that is not in accordance with the law, showing no respect or consideration for the other participating sectors. The Government refers in particular to FEDECAMARAS' refusal to take part in the dialogue to which it has been invited, within the framework of the work of the National Constituent Assembly, to contribute to the country s economic and social development (the Government refers to the decree of  August of the National Constituent Assembly calling for a national constituent dialogue of the productive sectors throughout the country). The Government states that the fact that there has been no progress on social dialogue in the country was due to the expression by FEDECAMARAS of political-partisan interests, which are unrelated to labour and business matters and not in accordance with the constitutional and legal order. In this regard, it points out that FEDECAMARAS has refused to engage in dialogue with the Government and the most representative workers' organizations (remembering that it did not participate in the ILO-sponsored meeting during the International Labour Conference in ). The Government expresses the hope that FEDECAMARAS recognize the institutional framework of the country and leaves the door open to engage in dialogue in conditions of public recognition, either within the framework of the National Constituent Assembly or any other governmental body.
.Finally, the Government indicates that it reserves the opportunity to continue to report on the other conclusions and recommendations of the Committee, while at the same time stating that it does not agree with them and that it will expand its reply in due course.
.As regards recommendation (a) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, its leaders and affiliated companies), the Committee notes with deep regret that the Government is again using its reply to accuse the complainant organization to be linked to those who carried out destabilizing actions in the country and gives no indication that it has taken any measures to prevent acts and statements of stigmatization and intimidation, as the Committee recommended. The Committee notes once again with regret the persistence of attacks, threats and interference in the country s employer sector and against its leaders, impairing the capacity of the employers' organizations to defend the interests of their members. Under these circumstances, the Committee regrets that it must reiterate its previous recommendation and urges the Government to take the requested measures without delay. In this regard, the Committee is bound to reiterate that for the contribution of trade unions and employers' organizations to be properly useful and credible, they must be able to carry out their activities in a climate of freedom and security. This implies that, in so far as they may consider that they do not have the basic freedom to fulfil their mission directly, trade unions and employers' organizations would be justified in demanding that these freedoms and the right to exercise them be recognized and that these demands be considered as coming within the scope of legitimate trade union activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee again notes that, throughout its examination of this case, it has been witness to many serious accusations levelled against FEDECAMARAS by the Government and has noted with great concern the many allegations of attacks against this organization, emphasizing that, taken as a whole, these allegations create a climate of intimidation of employers' organizations and their leaders that is incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. . In this regard, the Committee regrets that it is bound to recall once again the principle whereby the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. It firmly urges the Government to take all the necessary measures in this regard and with a view to the promotion of social dialogue based on respect. The Committee recalls that, according to the Declaration of Philadelphia, which is part of the ILO Constitution, the war against want requires to be carried on by an effort in which the representatives of workers and employers, enjoying equal status with those of governments, join with them in free discussion and democratic decision with a view to the promotion of the common welfare.
.As regards recommendation (b) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of violence, specifically, the abduction and mistreatment of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz in ), the Committee regrets that the Government neither sends, despite repeated requests by it, a copy of the ruling issued (in its previous examination of the case, the Government indicated that it had sent a request to the Public Prosecutor s Office to obtain a copy thereof) nor provides more detailed information on the granting of compensation. The Committee urges the Government to send it a copy of the ruling issued and to state whether other people were charged (providing information on any related proceedings and the outcome thereof). The Committee also requests the Government to inform it of the status and possible outcome of any claims or judicial proceedings (submitting a copy of any relevant judgments) relating to the granting of compensation to FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned for the damage caused by these illegal acts. As regards the February  bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee regrets that it has not received any reply from the Government and again insists that the Government send its observations on the points raised by FEDECAMARAS and, in particular, on the outcome of the appeal against the closing of the case and on any investigation carried out in order to determine whether anyone else was involved in the attack, and thus to shed light on its motive and to prevent any recurrence.
.Recommendations (c) and (d) of the previous examination of the case by the Committee concern: the establishment of structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue and an action plan, with a view to resolving all outstanding issues, including issues relating to the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, as well as actions that create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee observes that the Government provides information on an attempt to hold a tripartite meeting during the International Labour Conference and indicates that it has invited FEDECAMARAS to join the dialogue processes relating to the transformation and reorganization of the State, which are linked to the work of the National Constituent Assembly. Furthermore, the Committee notes that the complainant organizations still report that there is no",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
116,"effective dialogue beyond certain formal exchanges and reiterate that there have been no dialogue processes in the country to which the Government had committed itself before the Governing Body of the ILO. The Committee notes with regret that, beyond the attempt to hold a meeting during the International Labour Conference, it is not apparent from information provided by the Government that it has followed up on the measures it had announced before the ILO Governing Body (an action plan that provided for the establishment of a round table for dialogue between representatives of the Government and of FEDECAMARAS, with a schedule of fortnightly meetings and the inclusion of FEDECAMARAS in the future socio economic dialogue round table). The Committee also notes with regret that the Government does not report having taking any concrete steps to follow up on the Committee s recommendations concerning the establishment of structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue, as well as an action plan to be established in consultation with the social partners with stages and specific time frames for implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO ' an action plan recommended since  by the Governing Body as a result of the high-level tripartite mission. While deeply deploring the lack of information and progress in this regard and in light of the Governing Body s decision of  March  (in the examination of a complaint presented by virtue of article  of the ILO Constitution against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela alleging non-compliance with Conventions Nos ,  and ), in which the Government was urged to institutionalize without delay a tripartite round table, with the presence of the ILO, to foster social dialogue for the resolution of all pending issues, including matters relating to the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee reiterates its recommendation and insists on the urgency of the Government taking the requested measures without delay, including taking immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations.
.As regards recommendation (e) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors), the Committee takes due note of the fact that, in relation to the supermarket chain, the cases against the accused were closed (the preventive detention measures against them have consequently been lifted) but that the Prosecutor s Office appealed the decision in January . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this appeal. With regard to the meat processing company, the Committee notes that, while some of the charges against some of those under investigation are specified, the Government does not indicate, as requested by the Committee, the specific allegations against each of the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities. The Committee is therefore bound to reiterate its previous recommendation and urges the Government to provide precise information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings. Noting that only one preventive detention would remain in force, the Committee calls on the authorities to consider lifting or replacing this preventive detention measure. Finally, regarding the complainants' allegations of  May  (assaults and arrests of leaders, employees and shareholders of a consortium of credit card transaction companies by government authorities, subjecting them to public ridicule without guaranteeing due process and their right of defence), the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the acts in question were a response to financial sabotage, that the competent authorities proceeded to arrest the perpetrators, and that it was in no way an act of intimidation against businessmen. In the absence of more detailed information and in the light of the grave nature of the allegations, the Committee invites the complainant organizations to provide any additional information at their disposal and requests the Government to send a detailed reply in the light of such information, indicating the specific allegations against each of the persons under investigation or trial and to provide information on the progress and status of the judicial proceedings concerned.
.As regards recommendation (f) from its previous examination of the case (referring to the holding of full consultations with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, including FEDECAMARAS, on draft legislation covering labour, economic or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members), the Committee notes that, with regard to consultations at the national level, the Government indicated that it had requested FEDECAMARAS to provide in writing comments on the increase in the minimum wage and that, in its most recent observations, it referred to a broad call for dialogue with the productive sectors within the framework of the Constituent National Assembly. Furthermore, the Committee notes that complainant organizations continue to denounce the lack of effective dialogue (in relation to the invitation to provide comments on the increase in the minimum wage, FEDECAMARAS indicates that it was unable to make specific considerations, as the Government did not transmit to it any specific terms or elements on the increase under consideration, and therefore the increase was approved without consultation). The Committee emphasizes that it is important that consultations take place in good faith, confidence and mutual respect, and that the parties have sufficient time to express their views and discuss them in full with a view to reaching a suitable compromise. The Government must also ensure that it attaches the necessary importance to agreements reached between workers' and employers' organizations [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee further notes that, as claimed by the complainant organizations and not denied by the Government, important governmental measures affecting the interests of employers' organizations, such as the establishment of Workers' Production Boards (WPBs), have continued to be taken without consultation with the social partners concerned, including FEDECAMARAS. Deeply deploring the persistent nature of this situation, the Committee firmly urges that full consultations on draft legislation covering labour, economic or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members be held without delay with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, including FEDECAMARAS.
.The Committee also notes with concern the allegations of the complainant organizations regarding the establishment, without consultation, of bodies that would infringe on the freedom of association, in particular the WPBs (formed of three employees' representatives from the enterprise and four from the State, and which is in charge of reviewing, approving, controlling and monitoring the fundamental programmes and projects of the productive process of the work entities), as an additional mechanism of state interference. The complainant organizations also refer to other strategies and institutions for state interference (like the General Staff of the Working Class (a government organization to strengthen the WPBs) and the Labour Feminist Brigades (a body to promote control of the entire social process of work in each company)). The Committee takes note that the Government states that: (i) WPBs are an institution in accordance with the Organic Labour and Workers Act which was established to promote the participation of the working class as a key actor in the management of production; and (ii) that the creation of WPBs in no way replaces or opposes the trade union organization, but rather it is conceived as a form of primary participation of workers in the real and effective monitoring of the productive processes of their work entities. The Committee notes with great concern, however, that Decree No.  of  November  establishing the WPBs, which is applicable to all labour entities in the country, both public and private and issued under the state of emergency for economic hardship states in its preamble, with a view to justifying the introduction of the WPBs, that: (i)  the Ministry ... has the obligation to organize the working class starting from the work entities themselves'  (ii) Article  states that the scope and purpose of the WPBs is  to promote the participation of the working class as a key actor in the management of production from both public and private work entities'  and (iii) that the WPBs are created with a pre-established composition that comprises representatives of the public authorities, including the armed forces and the Bolivarian militias. The Committee considers that the establishment of the WPBs constitutes a violation of the freedom of association and an interference in the free development of collective relations between workers' organizations and employers and their organizations. The Committee is bound to recall that a government should not adopt measures such as the creation by decree of institutions to organize workers into bodies established and controlled by public authorities, which may interfere with the right of workers to organize freely and the freedom of negotiation between independent organizations of workers and of employers. In this regard, the Committee considers that the establishment of public bodies that may involve government control over the representation of the workers' sector also constitutes interference",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
117,"in the freedom of action and of negotiation of the employers and their organizations and is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures, including the repeal or reform of regulations or legislation with a view to eliminating any institutions or provisions established or promoted by public authorities ' including the WPBs or other bodies such as the General Staff of the Working Class and the Labour Feminist Brigades ' which may supplant independent trade union organizations or interfere in the freedom of negotiation between independent workers' organizations and employers' organizations. In view of the fact that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified Conventions Nos  and , the Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) and requests the Government to keep the CEARC informed of any measures adopted in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deploring the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, the Committee insists on the urgency of the Government taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b) As regards the abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), the Committee once again urges the Government to send a copy of the ruling by which the accused was sentenced and to state whether other people were charged (providing information on any related proceedings and the outcome thereof). The Committee also requests the Government to inform it of the status and possible outcome of any complaint or judicial proceedings (sending a copy of any relevant ruling) relating to the granting of compensation to FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned for the damage caused by these illegal acts. As regards the February  bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee again insists that the Government send its observations on the points raised by FEDECAMARAS and, in particular, on the outcome of the appeal against the closing of the case and on any investigation carried out in order to determine whether anyone else was involved in the attack, and thus to shed light on its motive and to prevent any recurrence.(c) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue that need to be established in the country; the plan of action to be established in consultation with the social partners with stages and specific time frames for implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body; and the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee deeply deplores the lack of information and further progress in this regard. It recalls that the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission conducted in  refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee also recalls that at its March  session, in examining the complaint presented under article  of the ILO Constitution against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela alleging non-compliance with Conventions Nos ,  and , the Governing Body urged the Government to institutionalize without delay a tripartite round table, with the presence of the ILO, to foster social dialogue for the resolution of all pending issues, including matters relating to the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders. The Committee insists once again on the urgency of the Government adopting immediately tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission and the Governing Body. Deeply deploring once again that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee once again urges it to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon.(d) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, again urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee urges the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard.(e) As regards the criminal investigations concerning the meat processing company, the Committee urges the Government not merely to give an indication of general criminal offences but to indicate the specific allegations against each of the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities and to provide precise information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings. Furthermore, the Committee requests the competent authorities to consider lifting or replacing the only preventive detention measure in the framework of those investigations. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the Prosecutor s Office s appeal against the judicial decision to close the criminal investigations concerning the supermarket chain. In relation to allegations of assault and detention of leaders and shareholders of a consortium of credit card transaction companies, the Committee invites the complainant organizations to provide any additional information at their disposal and requests the Government to send a detailed reply in the light of such information, indicating the specific allegations against each of the persons under investigation or trial and to provide information on the progress and status of the judicial proceedings concerned.(f) The Committee firmly urges that full consultations on draft legislation covering labour, economic or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members be held without delay with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, including FEDECAMARAS.(g) The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures, including the repeal or reform of regulations or legislation with a view to eliminating any institutions or provisions established or promoted by public authorities ' including the WPBs or other bodies such as the General Staff of the Working Class and the Labour Feminist Brigades ' which may supplant independent trade union organizations or interfere in the freedom of negotiation between independent organizations of workers and of employers. In view of the fact that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified Conventions Nos  and , the Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) and requests the Government to keep the CEARC informed of any measures adopted in this regard.(h) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(i) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its May June  session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ), paras ' ].
.The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers and Associations of Commerce and Production (FEDECAMARAS) provided additional information in joint communications dated  July  and  May .
.The Government sent additional observations in communications dated  September  and  May .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined the case at its May June  session, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:While once again expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops and the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the urgency of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
118," and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b)	As regards the abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), while noting the sentencing of one of the accused to  years and eight months' imprisonment, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the ruling issued and to continue providing additional information concerning any penalties imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes, and concerning any compensation to FEDECAMARAS and to the leaders concerned for damage caused by those illegal acts. Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its request to the Government to send its observations concerning the points raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters on  February .(c)	As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee insists that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which in turn refers to  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee regrets that the Government stated in previous communications that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable and that, in its latest communication, it merely indicates that it proceeded in compliance with the law. The Committee firmly urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Lastly, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d)	As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee regrets the lack of information and further progress in this regard. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission also refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Observing that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meetings held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February and October , and to implement tripartite consultations immediately.(e)	The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee regrets that the Government has not appointed a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the social dialogue body fulfilling its functions, and urges the Government to do so as soon as possible.(f)	The Committee, having noted the Government s observations concerning the allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors, regrets that once again a full answer has not been provided in relation to the individuals who are the subject of investigation procedures. As regards the cases of Corporacin Crnica and the  Da a Da Practimercados' chain, the Committee urges the Government to indicate the specific allegations against the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities, and not merely give an indication of general criminal offences, and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings and their compliance with precautionary or detention measures. The Committee again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on employers' and business leaders pending trial. As regards the allegation of the detention of the managers of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the charges against these individuals have been dropped or, if not, to indicate the specific allegations against them and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings; and, in view of the complainants' allegation that four of the owners and managers of this pharmacy chain had been arrested, the Committee urges the Government to indicate whether any other individuals are currently under arrest or trial, and it invites the complainant organizations to provide the Government and the Committee with any detailed information that they may have on this matter.(g) As regards the allegations of the detention of the president of [the National Commerce and Services Council (CONSECOMERCIO)], Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the president of [the National Association of Supermarkets and Self-Service Stores (ANSA)], Mr Luis Rodrguez, and the president of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Mr Rosales Briceo, and allegations of shadowing and harassment of the president of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Jorge Roig, given the divergences between the allegations and the Government s reply, the Committee invites the complainants to provide the Government and the Committee with additional information, including any evidence they may have, and it urges the Government, on the basis of such information, to carry out any relevant additional investigations and to keep the Committee informed on this matter.(h) As regards the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, the Committee regrets that the Government has not made any observation concerning their impact on social dialogue and, deeply deploring the persistence of this situation, it firmly expects that full consultations will be held in the future with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS, on draft legislation covering labour or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members.(i)	The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(j)	The Committee notes with great concern the new allegations of the IOE and FEDECAMARAS dated  May , in which it is alleged: (i) the enactment in December , without consultation with the social partners, of  national laws, including the law on job security; (ii) semblance of dialogue through communications to FEDECAMARAS by the Government, when it has already announced or adopted the measures concerned; (iii) the unilateral promulgation without prior consultation of the Decree of the President of the Republic declaring a state of emergency for economic hardship; (iv) new acts of intimidation against FEDECAMARAS; (v) approval without consultation of a new increase in the minimum wage and the value of the socialist Cestaticket in February ; and (vi) failure by the Government to implement the road map presented to the Governing Body of the ILO in March . The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay so that the Committee can examine all the relevant elements.(k)	The Committee once again draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communication of  July , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS report new events that constitute repeated and aggravated violation of the principles of freedom of association and proof of the Government s unwillingness to resume social dialogue.
.First, the complainants report that the Government has failed to honour its undertaking to establish dialogue round tables. They recall that during the March  session of the Governing Body, the Government presented a proposed action plan",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
119,"that provided for the establishment of a round table for dialogue between representatives of the Government and of FEDECAMARAS and included a schedule of fortnightly meetings. FEDECAMARAS stated that the first meeting could not be held on the proposed date of  April  because it had previously scheduled a national council meeting for that date. However, although FEDECAMARAS contacted the People s Ministry for the Social Process of Labour on several occasions in an effort to reschedule the first meeting, as at the date of the communication it had received no invitation. On  April , FEDECAMARAS sent the Ministry a letter in which it mentioned the failure to implement the action plan proposed by the Government. On  May , FEDECAMARAS informed the Government that it was concerned at the Government s continuing and persistent violations of the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) through further acts of intimidation, approval of the minimum wage without consultation and failure to honour commitments to the Governing Body. In this second communication, FEDECAMARAS once again called for sincere, ongoing and effective dialogue in order to find tangible solutions to the crisis faced by the country. It received no reply to this message; moreover, in public speeches broadcast on the state channel on  April and  May , the President of the Republic declared that he was not prepared to engage in any dialogue with FEDECAMARAS.
.Second, the complainants report further acts of intimidation directed against FEDECAMARAS, in particular: (a) intimidating accusations made during the aforementioned public speeches made by the President of the Republic, in which the current and former Chairpersons of FEDECAMARAS were depicted as enemies of the workers and curtailers of labour rights; (b) use of the state television channel to call on the public to mobilize against FEDECAMARAS (a programme entitled  Zurda Konducta'  broadcast on  April ); (c) a press release issued by the President of the Republic on  May , attacking FEDECAMARAS and stating that FEDECAMARAS and its affiliate, the National Commerce and Services Council (CONSECOMERCIO), were the only unions that were not members of the National Council on the Productive Economy (although it was the President himself who had selected and sworn in the members of that Council and had not invited FEDECAMARAS or its affiliates); and (d) a statement made by a deputy ' who is also the Deputy Chairperson of the ruling party ' in his programme on the state television channel, claiming that the entrepreneurs who had signed the request for a recall referendum would be ineligible for government contracts and for loans from the state-owned bank.
.Third, the complainants report that on  May  (three days after the expiration of the most recent economic emergency decree), the Government once again decreed a state of economic emergency through Decree No. , which suspends the constitutional guarantees on economic matters in language that repeats intimidating and groundless claims of a hostile, destabilizing attitude on the part of some private sectors of the economy, an attack on the Government and efforts to hinder access to essential public goods and services by the country s economic agents at the instigation of foreign interests. The Decree also gives the Government sweeping powers, imposes additional repressive measures on employers and authorizes using the armed forces and other organizations to ensure the distribution and sale of food and other essential items, taking steps to ensure that the private sector provides support to the public sector and placing restrictions on commercial and financial operations and transactions. These intimidating and repressive measures, together with the media campaigns waged against FEDECAMARAS and its members by the Government and its agencies, are seriously undermining freedom of association.
.In their communication of  May , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS allege: (i) authorities and spokespersons for or linked to the Government have continued to attack FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and the business sector; intimidating accusations and threats have been made through the media by, among others, the Deputy Chairperson of the government party and the President of the Republic himself; government authorities have attacked and detained leaders, employees and shareholders, accusing them of corruption or economic destabilization and subjecting them to public ridicule without guaranteeing due process or their right of defence; (ii) there is no genuine dialogue: the complainants reiterate that the dialogue which the Government had announced to the Governing Body of the ILO has not taken place and emphasize that FEDECAMARAS has been excluded through new government measures that have an impact on business performance and undermine freedom of association (such as the approval, without consultation, of the purchase from farmers of  per cent of agro-industrial production for use by local supply and production committees and the creation of workers' production boards as one of several government strategies for using the country s labour movement in support of the Government and against employers); (iii) another economic emergency decree was promulgated on  September  (and, once again, its wording is part of the campaign to stigmatize the business sector) and increases in the minimum wage and the cestaticket (food voucher) were approved without consultation in January and April  and February , respectively; (iv) notwithstanding the fact that written communications were exchanged and meetings held between FEDECAMARAS and the People s Ministry for the Social Process of Labour (specifically, on  and  January and  April ), these meetings, which were held in a climate of institutional respect, were purely formal in nature, did not take place within structured dialogue mechanisms or in a climate of sufficient trust between the parties to support the realization of effective dialogue and were carried out simultaneously with the aforementioned intimidating attacks; and (v) while it is possible that one of its chambers of commerce or employers might participate in a meeting on a one-time basis, FEDECAMARAS as an institution is still not a member of the National Council on the Productive Economy.
.In its communication of  September , the Government sent its observations concerning the aforementioned recommendations of the Committee.
.Concerning recommendation (a), the Government once again denies having attacked, harassed or persecuted FEDECAMARAS, its affiliates or its leaders and emphasizes that no FEDECAMARAS members have been detained or prosecuted. On the contrary, the Government indicates that it has implemented policies designed to foster private enterprises by increasing their productivity. The Government maintains that through actions wholly unrelated to employer representation, FEDECAMARAS functions as a political organization in opposition to the Government and the President of the Republic (as seen from its Chairperson s recent support for the recall referendum; its involvement in the  coup d at, when its Chairperson proclaimed himself President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; and other attacks on and attempts to destabilize the Government). The Government states that the country is experiencing a complex economic situation owing to the decline in oil prices and the destabilization efforts of economic groups and that this has led to a flurry of statements and demonstrations by both government and private enterprise representatives which demonstrate that there is complete freedom of expression in the country and that institutions are in place to hear the complaints of people who feel that they have been affected, insulted or slandered. The Government considers that freedom of association and expression are freely exercised in the country and that there has been no violation of Convention No. . It therefore calls on the Committee to cease to examine irrelevant issues and not to allow itself to be co-opted by individual political interests in a campaign against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.Concerning recommendation (b), the Government reiterates that the trial of Mr Antonio Jos Silvia Moyega was concluded on  September  and that he was sentenced to  years and eight months' imprisonment for his attacks on Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz and is currently in prison. The Government adds that this was shown to have been a chance act perpetrated by a criminal gang and that the victims were not targeted because they were business leaders and FEDECAMARAS members. The Government adds that it has requested the Public Prosecutor s Office to provide a copy of the judgment, which, once received, will be forwarded to the Committee. It further states that it has already provided its observations concerning the attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , stating that the perpetrator has died and that the Public Prosecutor s Office has reported that for this reason, it has closed the case. The Government reiterates its request that the Committee not pursue its examination of these allegations and considers that it has already provided sufficient information concerning them.
.Concerning recommendation (c), the Government maintains that there has been no violation of property rights or discrimination in implementing the land recovery legislation and that",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
120,"these issues lie outside the Committee s mandate. The Government reiterates that in recent years, under the farmland recovery policy, there have been many recoveries of illegally occupied idle land to which the occupants were unable to show title and emphasizes that very few of the recoveries could have affected FEDECAMARAS leaders (the reported cases account for . per cent of the lands recovered). The Government considers that this proves that there has been no retaliation against any entrepreneur or member of FEDECAMARAS, but rather implementation of its policy for elimination of the landed estate (latifundia) system as a whole for the benefit of workers in line with the Tenants and Share-croppers Recommendation,  (No. ) and the Rural Workers' Organisations Recommendation,  (No. )). It also emphasizes that the recoveries have been carried out with full respect for rights and guarantees and that where the people who occupied the recovered land can show that they have made improvements to it, they are compensated accordingly. As regards Mr Eduardo Gmez Sgala, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Government reiterates that there was no expropriation; the lands were recovered because they were idle and the occupants were unable to show title to them, and the law and due process were followed (in the case of Mr Garmendia, only a portion of the land that he occupied was recovered because he was able to show title to another portion, which is still in his possession). As regards the cases of Mr Egildo Lujn and Mr Vicente Brito, the Government reiterates that according to the National Land Institute, its archives contain no information on any possible recoveries or expropriations under their names.
.Concerning recommendation (d), as previously the Government states that there is broad, inclusive social dialogue in the country and emphasizes that FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and its affiliates have met with various government authorities on countless occasions. The Government maintains that while some organizations have used non-attendance at consultations and round tables as a political strategy, this has not prevented hundreds of their affiliate employers' organizations from participating. The Government recalls the  establishment of the Economic Conference for Peace, in which all of the economic and social sectors were invited to take part and at which  different working groups comprising representatives of the Government, workers and employers from all parts of the country were set up with the aim of boosting the national economy; the establishment, in , of the Presidential Commission on Economic Affairs (as one of the outcomes of the economic working groups) in order to boost the export of non-traditional products; and the holding of other enterprise meetings such as the International Chocolate Fair (October ) and the Sustainable Venezuela World Expo (September ). The Government also draws attention to the establishment of the National Council on the Productive Economy, which comprises representatives of the public authorities, academic institutions and public and private sector workers and entrepreneurs, in order to hold discussions and make recommendations for overcoming the current economic situation and the decline in oil prices. The Government regrets that FEDECAMARAS is still claiming to be excluded and marginalized even though many of its chambers of commerce and enterprises participate in dialogues, consultations, technical discussions, agreements and negotiations; in particular, many of its chambers of commerce are involved in the work of the aforementioned Council. In that connection, the Government explains that the Council s members include the chairpersons of the following FEDECAMARAS associations and enterprises: the Oil Board, a member of FEDECAMARAS; the Plastics Board, a member of the Venezuelan Confederation of Industrialists (CONINDUSTRIA) and of FEDECAMARAS; the Venezuelan Chemical and Petrochemical Industry Association (ASOQUIM), a member of CONINDUSTRIA and of FEDECAMARAS; Supracal Corp., a member of ASOQUIM and of FEDECAMARAS; and the Venezuelan Banking Association, a member of the Executive Board of FEDECAMARAS. The Government also emphasizes that, since its establishment, the Council has held various meetings and events and has set up round tables for the manufacturing, export, forestry, construction, automotive, agro-food, mining, hydrocarbon, petrochemical, tourism and telecommunications industries; the Government provides details on these meetings and activities in its observations. It also mentions loans and financing that have been provided to enterprises and entrepreneurs and the first Supply and Demand Forum (of the Integrated and Standardized Government Procurement System), in which over  enterprises participated. It reiterates that representatives of FEDECAMARAS affiliate enterprises and chambers of commerce have participated in all of these forums, meetings and round tables and that this is proof of its desire to promote and sustain such dialogue with the business sector and of the importance that it attaches to that sector s involvement in and incorporation into the country s productive economy. It also mentions various statements that the current and former chairpersons of FEDECAMARAS have made to the media, in which they acknowledged the existence of dialogue with the Government. It recalls that in three written communications sent to the Chairperson of FEDECAMARAS in October and December , the People s Ministry for the Social Process of Labour expressed its willingness to give FEDECAMARAS a greater role in discussions with a view to the development of labour policies, laws and regulations. The Government therefore emphasizes that it maintains an ongoing dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and that while the business sector may consider that the outcome thereof is not entirely favourable to it, this does not mean that there is an absence of social dialogue.
.Concerning recommendation (f), the Government states that:(i)	With regard to the  Da a Da Practimercados' supermarket chain (hereinafter  the supermarket chain' , the Government reiterates that on  February , an inspection of the supermarket chain was carried out by a presidential commission and the Office of the National Superintendent for the Defence of Socio-Economic Rights (SUNDDE). They found irregularities in the distribution of goods, as a result of which Mr Manuel Andrs Morales Ordosgoitti and Mr Tadeo Arriechi, the chain s General Director and legal representative, respectively, were investigated. The Government adds that these people are, however, at liberty and that any additional information provided by the Public Prosecutor s Office will be forwarded to the Committee.(ii)	With regard to the directors of Corporacin Crnica (hereinafter  the meat processing company' , the Government reiterates that on  January , SUNDDE officials visited the establishment following complaints that it was overcharging for goods. This irregularity was verified during the inspection and led to the seizure of more than  tonnes of hoarded meat products. For this reason, Ms Tania Carolina Salinas, Ms Delia Isabel Ribas, Ms Anllerlin Guadalupe Lpez Graterol, Mr Ernesto Luis Arenas Pulgar and Mr Yolman Javier Valderrama Santiago are currently being investigated by the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Government will forward to the Committee any additional information received from that Office.(iii)	With regard to the FARMATODO pharmacy chain (hereinafter  the pharmacy chain' , the Government states that the managers of the pharmacy chain, Mr Pedro Luis Angarita and Mr Agustn lvarez, are at liberty and have not been charged; it therefore requests that there be no further examination of this allegation.(iv)	With regard to the alleged detention of the former Chairperson of CONINDUSTRIA, Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the Government reiterates that he was not detained; on the contrary, he received a summons and made his own way to the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) headquarters in order to answer questions concerning his statements to a national newspaper concerning the impact that the chikungunya outbreak would have on productivity. The Government states that Mr Garmendia has acknowledged that these statements were made without evidence and that he was treated courteously by the SEBIN officials who questioned him; it requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of this matter.(v)	The Government also reiterates that there is no record of any investigation of the Chairperson of ANSA, Mr Luis Rodrguez, who is at liberty. It therefore requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of this allegation. (The Government also reiterates that on  February , an interview was held at SEBIN headquarters after Mr Rodriguez had expressed the desire to provide information on the  Da a Da Practimercados' case.)(vi)	With regard to the Chairperson of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Mr Rosales Briceo, the Government reiterates that he was interviewed on  February  in connection with statements that he had made and that he is not under investigation and is at liberty; it therefore requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of this allegation.
.Concerning recommendation (h) from its previous examination of the case, the Government once again informs the Committee that article () of the Constitution empowers the President of the Republic, with prior authorization under an enabling act, to issue decrees with the force of law and that enabling acts must be approved by three-fifths of the members of the National Assembly in order to establish guidelines, objectives and the framework for matters delegated to the President of the Republic. The Government states that enabling",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
121,"acts lie within the competence of the President of the Republic, the discussion of legislation and draft legislation within that of the National Assembly, and national socio-economic policy within that of the executive branch in coordination with the other branches of government, without prejudice to the country s existing and operational mechanisms for consultation and social dialogue.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government sent its observations replying to the allegations of the complainant organizations of  May . With respect to the allegations of intimidating attacks perpetuated against FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated organizations and its leaders, the Government refers to the information it provided to the Governing Body at its th Session (March ). Furthermore, in its observations, the Government affirms that: (i) the various measures that allegedly constituted attacks on various business sectors were not arbitrary and were carried out in accordance with the law and with the goal of protecting the population; (ii) the purchase of  per cent of agro industrial production was carried out in accordance with its mandate to ensure the availability of commodities within the context of economic warfare and the creation of workers' production boards was carried out to promote the participation of the working class in the management of production, without replacing or opposing the trade union organization; (iii) the increase of the cestaticket (food voucher) was the result of its natural annual adjustment and the People s Ministry for the Social Process of Labour had asked FEDECAMARAS, in its communication dated  February , to submit its proposals concerning the salary increase that was customary for Labour Day. The replies, received from FEDECAMARAS on  and  April , did not contain any concrete proposals.
.As regards recommendation (a) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, its leaders and affiliated companies), the Committee notes with deep regret that the Government is again using its reply to accuse the complainant organization and gives no indication that it has taken any measures to prevent acts and statements of stigmatization and intimidation, as the Committee recommended. Under the circumstances, the Committee is bound to reiterate its previous recommendation and urges the Government to take the requested measures without delay. The Committee recalls that, for the contribution of trade unions and employers' organizations to be properly useful and credible, they must be able to carry out their activities in a climate of freedom and security. This implies that, in so far as they may consider that they do not have the basic freedom to fulfil their mission directly, trade unions and employers' organizations would be justified in demanding that these freedoms and the right to exercise them be recognized and that these demands be considered as coming within the scope of legitimate trade union activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee again notes that, throughout its examination of this case, it has been witness to many serious accusations levelled against FEDECAMARAS by the Government and has noted with great concern the many allegations of attacks against this organization, emphasizing that, taken as a whole, these allegations create a climate of intimidation of employers' organizations and their leaders that is incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. . In this regard, the Committee regrets that it is bound to recall once again the principle whereby the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. It firmly urges the Government to take all the necessary measures in this regard and with a view to the promotion of social dialogue based on respect.
.As regards recommendation (b) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of violence and threats directed against FEDECAMARAS and its member organizations and, specifically, the abduction and mistreatment of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz in ), the Committee takes note of the Government s reiterated observations that in  Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega was sentenced to  years and eight months' imprisonment for the crimes committed in  and that it has been shown that the victims were not targeted because they were FEDECAMARAS members. The Committee urges the Government to send it a copy of the ruling issued and to state whether other people were charged (providing information on any related proceedings and the outcome thereof) and whether FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned received compensation for the damage caused by these illegal acts. As regards the  bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee recalls that FEDECAMARAS indicated to the high-level tripartite mission that: () the person who planted the bomb (a police inspector, Mr Hctor Serrano) died as a result of the explosion; () on  February , a complaint was filed with the Public Prosecutor s Office; () on  August , the Public Prosecutor s Office issued a ruling ordering the case to be closed for lack of sufficient evidence to establish a guilty party, and this ruling was appealed by FEDECAMARAS; () on  May , the Forensic, Penal and Criminal Investigations Unit (CICPC) announced that a public official (a police officer), Mr Crisstomo Montoya, had been detained on charges of terrorism for having planted the explosive device (it is reported that he has been released) and that Ms Ivonne Mrquez had also been implicated; () the th Court of First Instance scheduled the public hearing of the trial for  November  and the hearing was postponed until  October ; and () to date, no one has been found guilty of the attack. While noting the Government s reiteration that the perpetrator has died and that the case has therefore been closed, the Committee again insists that the Government send its observations on the points raised by FEDECAMARAS and, in particular, to inform it of the outcome of the appeal against the closing of the case and on any investigation carried out in order to determine whether anyone else was involved in the attack, and thus to shed light on its motive and to prevent any recurrence.
.As regards recommendation (c) (seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders) and (d) (bipartite and tripartite social dialogue) from its previous examination of the case, the Committee observes that the Government has reiterated its previous remarks and emphasized that there is broad, inclusive social dialogue in the country. On the one hand, the Committee takes note of the Government s various initiatives; its statement that FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and its affiliates have met with various government authorities on countless occasions and, in particular, that many FEDECAMARAS chambers of commerce, enterprises and members participate actively in the work of the National Council on the Productive Economy and in other forums; and its mention of other forms of dialogue, such as written communications. On the other hand, the Committee notes that FEDECAMARAS challenges these statements and, in particular, states that it was not invited to become a member of the Council; that the Government has not replied to its communications; that the President of the Republic has publicly declared that he was not prepared to engage in any dialogue with FEDECAMARAS; and that the Government has failed to honour the undertaking to establish dialogue round tables with FEDECAMARAS that it made before the Governing Body of the ILO: (i) in March , the Government presented an action plan that provided for the establishment of a round table for dialogue between representatives of the Government and of FEDECAMARAS and included a schedule of fortnightly meetings, but the round table has not been established; and (ii) in November , the Government undertook to include FEDECAMARAS in the future socio-economic dialogue round table but although the Ministry of Labour and FEDECAMARAS held two meetings in January , there has been no progress in establishing such a round table on the plan of action announced to the Governing Body. While welcoming the two meetings held in January , the Committee again observes that the Government has provided no information on implementation of the plan of action recommended by the Governing Body as a result of the high-level tripartite mission conducted in . While deeply deploring the lack of information and progress in this regard and in light of the Governing Body s decision of  March  (in the examination of a complaint presented by virtue of article  of the ILO Constitution against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela alleging non-compliance with Conventions Nos ,  and , in which the Government was urged to institutionalize without delay a tripartite round table, with",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
122,"the presence of the ILO, to foster social dialogue for the resolution of all pending issues, including matters relating to the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders), the Committee reiterates its recommendation and insists on the urgency of the Government taking the requested measures without delay.
.As regards recommendation (e) from its previous examination of the case (action to create a climate of trust and, in particular, the appointment of a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the tripartite social dialogue body fulfilling its functions), the Committee regrets that the Government has made no observations in this regard. In line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee again urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee urges the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard.
.As regards recommendations (f) and (g) from its previous examination of the case (detention of employers or leaders), in the case concerning the supermarket chain, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements indicating that irregularities in the distribution of goods were found and that the chain s General Director and legal representative, respectively, were investigated but are now at liberty. In the case concerning the directors of the meat processing company, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that Ms Tania Carolina Salinas, Ms Delia Isabel Ribas, Ms Anllerlin Guadalupe Lpez Graterol, Mr Ernesto Luis Arenas Pulgar and Mr Yolman Javier Valderrama Santiago are currently being investigated by the Public Prosecutor s Office. Deeply deploring that the requested additional information on the allegations against each of the seven people under investigation has not been provided, the Committee urges the Government not merely to give an indication of general criminal offences, but to indicate the specific allegations against each of the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities and to provide precise information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings. Also in the case of the meat processing company, regretting that the Government has simply reiterated the statements made in its previous communication, the Committee urges it to state whether these employers and leaders have been subjected to precautionary or detention measures and again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on them. In the case of the pharmacy chain, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the chain s managers, Mr Pedro Luis Angarita and Mr Agustn lvarez, are at liberty and have not been charged. With regard to the alleged detention of the former Chairperson of CONINDUSTRIA, Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the Chairperson of ANSA, Mr Luis Rodrguez, and the Chairperson of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Mr Rosales Briceo, the Committee takes note of the fact that the Government reiterates that they have not been detained or investigated but were merely interviewed at SEBIN headquarters and that all of them are at liberty. The Committee underlines that the high number of employers and employers' organizations' leaders who were convened at SEBIN does not help creating a climate of trust free of pressure and threats.
.As regards recommendation (h) from its previous examination of the case (adoption by the President of the Republic of a large number of decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS), the Committee notes with regret that the Government merely repeats information that it has already provided on the constitutional legal basis empowering the President of the Republic to issue decrees with the force of law, without making any observation concerning their relevance for or impact on social dialogue. The Committee is bound to point out once again that, over the years, when examining various complaints relating to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, it has noted the use in many cases of enabling legislation by the Legislative Assembly empowering the President of the Republic to adopt many decrees and laws that affect the interests of workers' and employers' organizations without a parliamentary debate being held [see, in particular, Case No. , th Report, para. ]. The Committee emphasizes that it is important that consultations take place in good faith, confidence and mutual respect, and that the parties have sufficient time to express their views and discuss them in full with a view to reaching a suitable compromise. The Government must also ensure that it attaches the necessary importance to agreements reached between workers' and employers' organizations [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee has also emphasized the value of consulting organizations of employers and workers during the preparation and application of legislation which affects their interests and has drawn the attention of governments to the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. Deeply deploring the persistent nature of this situation, the Committee firmly urges that full consultations on draft legislation covering labour, economic or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members be held without delay with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS.
.The Committee notes with great concern the new allegations made by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS on  July  and  May  to the effect that: (i) the Government has failed to honour the undertaking to establish dialogue round tables that it made before the Governing Body of the ILO, and the highest-level state bodies have refused to enter into dialogue with FEDECAMARAS; (ii) further acts of intimidation have been directed against FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated organizations and their leaders by public figures and officials, including the President of the Republic, and the public has been called upon to mobilize against FEDECAMARAS; (iii) government authorities have launched attacks on the business sector and have attacked and detained leaders, employees and shareholders, accusing them of corruption or economic destabilization and subjecting them to public ridicule without guaranteeing due process or their right of defence; (iv) FEDECAMARAS has not been made a member of the National Council on the Productive Economy and has been excluded through new government measures that have an impact on business performance and undermine freedom of association, such as the approval, without consultation, of the purchase from farmers of  per cent of agro-industrial production for use by local supply and production committees and the creation of workers' production boards and other bodies through which the Government is interfering with relations between workers and employers; and (v) additional increases in the minimum wage and the cestaticket (food voucher) have been approved without tripartite consultation and two more states of economic emergency that suspended the constitutional guarantees on economic matters have been declared through instruments that contain intimidating claims that the country s economic agents have taken a hostile, destabilizing attitude, including by hindering access to essential public goods and services. On the other hand, the Committee observes that, in its communication dated  May , the Government provides its observations replying to the allegations of the complainant organizations of  May , affirming, in particular that: (i) it had responded to the allegations of intimidating attacks against FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated organizations and its leaders, before the Governing Body during its th Session (March ); (ii) the various measures that allegedly constituted attacks to various business sectors were not arbitrary and were carried out in accordance with the law and with the goal of protecting the population; (iii) the purchase of  per cent of agro-industrial production was carried out in accordance with its mandate to ensure the availability of commodities within the context of economic warfare and the creation of workers' production boards was carried out to promote the participation of the working class in the management of production, without replacing or opposing the trade union organization; (iii) the increase of the cestaticket (food voucher) was the result of its natural annual adjustment and, with respect to the salary increase of May , the opinion of FEDECAMARAS had been requested and no concrete response had been received. The Committee will examine these allegations and the reply at its next meeting, and requests the Government to communicate any additional relevant observations in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	While once again expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, the Committee insists on the urgency of the Government taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
123,"Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b)	As regards the abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), the Committee urges the Government to send a copy of the ruling by which one of the accused was sentenced and to state whether other people were charged (providing information on any related proceedings and the outcome thereof) and whether FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned received compensation for the damage caused by these illegal acts. As regards the February  bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee again insists that the Government send its observations on the points raised by FEDECAMARAS and, in particular, on the outcome of the appeal against the closing of the case and on any investigation carried out in order to determine whether anyone else was involved in the attack, and thus to shed light on its motive and to prevent any recurrence.(c)	As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue that need to be established in the country; the plan of action to be established in consultation with the social partners with stages and specific time frames for implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body; and the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee deeply deplores the lack of information and further progress in this regard. It recalls that the conclusions of the mission refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee also recalls that at its March  session, in examining the complaint presented under article  of the ILO Constitution against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela alleging non-compliance with Conventions Nos ,  and , the Governing Body urged the Government to institutionalize without delay a tripartite round table, with the presence of the ILO, to foster social dialogue for the resolution of all pending issues, including matters relating to the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders. The Committee insists on the urgency of the Government adopting immediately tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission and the Governing Body. Deeply deploring that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee once again urges it to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon.(d)	The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, again urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee urges the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard.(e)	The Committee, having noted the Government s observations concerning the allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors, deeply deplores that once again a full answer has not been provided in relation to the individuals who are the subject of investigation procedures. As regards the cases of the meat processing company and the supermarket chain, the Committee urges the Government not merely to give an indication of general criminal offences but to indicate the specific allegations against each of the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities and to provide precise information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings. Furthermore, in the case of the meat processing company, the Committee urges the Government to state whether these employers and leaders have been subjected to precautionary or detention measures and again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on them.(f)	As regards the adoption by the President of the Republic of numerous decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, deeply deploring that the Government has not made any observations concerning their impact on social dialogue and the persistent nature of this situation, the Committee firmly urges that full consultations on draft legislation covering labour, economic or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members be held without delay with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS.(g)	The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(h)	The Committee will examine the new allegations, made by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS and the reply of the Government thereto at its next meeting and requests the Government to send further relevant observations in this respect.(i)	The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting of May June , when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent additional observations in communications dated  and  October .
.The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers and Associations of Commerce and Production (FEDECAMARAS) provided additional information in a joint communication dated  May .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case at its May June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) While expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee draws the Government s attention to the importance of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.(b) The Committee notes with regret that the criminal proceedings relating to the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February  and the abduction and mistreatment in  of the leaders of that organization, Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds) have not yet been completed (FEDECAMARAS appealed against the ruling ordering the closure of the case concerning the bomb attack on its headquarters), again expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded without further delay, and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the issues raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee requests that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  and regrets that the Government stated in its last communication that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable. The Committee urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
124,"any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it has not yet concluded the process of consultation with different sectors and organizations and requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Noting that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meeting held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February , and to immediately implement tripartite consultations.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee further requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose any problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee notes with concern the new allegations by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS of  November  concerning: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, President of CONINDUSTRIA, for  hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, President of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level state officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee requests the Government to send complete observations on these allegations.(g) The Committee notes with concern new allegations from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS and the observations by the Government of  and  March  on some of the allegations. The Committee once again requests the Government to complete its response, to indicate the specific allegations against each of the  employers or managers from the different sectors who have been detained or placed under precautionary measures by the judicial authorities, and not to limit itself to an indication of the general criminal offences (boycott, hoarding, smuggling, speculation, etc.), and also to provide information on developments in the respective judicial proceedings. The Committee also requests the Government to forward its observations concerning the latest additional information transmitted by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS in their communication dated  May . The Committee intends to examine these serious issues in a detailed manner, in full knowledge of the facts, and requests the authorities to consider lifting the precautionary custodial measures imposed on employers and business leaders pending trial.(h) The Committee expresses its deep concern, observing the lack of information and any progress on the previous recommendations and firmly urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay, including with regard to the new allegations of acts of intimidation and stigmatization against FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and members by the authorities, contained in its communication of  May .(i) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In their communication dated  May , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS denounce new violations of the principles of freedom of association and the absence of dialogue from the Government.
.First, the complainants denounce the enactment in December , without consultation with the social partners,  national laws, including the law on job security which allows the labour inspection, under the Government s authority, to determine the qualification of a dismissal as well as the automatic reinstatement of the employee without the guarantee of the right to defence for employers.
.Second, the complainants allege that through communications Nos  and  from the Ministry of Popular Power for Social Work Process, aimed at FEDECAMARAS on  and  December  (during the festive period), the Government intended to maintain some semblance of dialogue with FEDECAMARAS when, in reality, the Government does not encourage constructive dialogue and continues to take measures without due consultations. In communication No.  of  December , the Government requested FEDECAMARAS to substantiate its application for the annulment of the LOTTT, to which FEDECAMARAS replied in specifying, by letter dated  January , that it had not called for the repeal of the law, but referred to the document entitled  Commitment to Freedom: for a regulatory framework for a better future'  approved by the st Annual Meeting of FEDECAMARAS ' which had already been submitted to the Government ' that contained comments on the rules governing employers, including some provisions of the LOTTT, since the latter was approved without consulting employers and workers. In communication No.  of  December , the Government declared reiterating its request to FEDECAMARAS, made during previous meetings of  and  October , to submit proposals on wage policy that would be evaluated in , on the regulations implementing the LOTTT and on job security. However, the complainants allege that the day after the meeting of  October and prior to the sending of their communication, the President of the Republic had already announced to the media a new increase in the minimum wage and other legislative reforms on tax, exchange rate and pricing, as well as the new law on job security, without engaging due consultation. Consequently, the complainants allege that the intended effective dialogue does not exist, that the alleged inquiries are made untimely when the measure to consult on has already been adopted or announced, and that the Government has not made up any workplan, nor has it engaged in serious and comprehensive discussions on labour issues, as requested by the supervisory bodies of the ILO.
.Third, the complainants denounce the unilateral adoption without prior consultation of the Decree of the President of the Republic declaring a state of emergency for economic hardship, suspending constitutional guarantees on economic matters and granting extraordinary powers to the Government, in a context where the President cannot exercise legislative power without the prior consent of the opposition majority in the National Assembly. The complainants denounce the fact that the bases of the Decree put the blame for the crisis on an economic war allegedly led by FEDECAMARAS and national entrepreneurs with foreign governments and international organizations. This Decree, to which FEDECAMARAS expressed adverse position, could justify the takeover of some companies and inventories. The complainants add that although the National Assembly, having engaged in a dialogue with various business and labour sectors including FEDECAMARAS, issued a decision disapproving the Decree, the Supreme Court of Justice confirmed the validity of the latter. The complainants allege that with such decision the Supreme Court undermined the separation of powers and the role of the National Assembly, exceeding its mandate by declaring, without having been asked, the nullity and annulment for unconstitutionality of article  of the Organic Law on the state of emergency (which provides for the omission of any decision and the termination of the instance in the event of disapproval of a state of emergency decree by the National Assembly). The complainants consider that the Government consolidates a model of autocratic State, at a time when the country requires mechanisms for effective social dialogue to address the crisis ' to which the technical assistance of the ILO could be of great value, but the Government refuses to receive such assistance in the terms recommended in the report of the tripartite high-level mission of . With regard to the establishment of the National Council for a Productive Economy on  January , the complainants state that, although some businesses representing the various economic sectors represented in FEDECAMARAS were incorporated under their personal capacity to the Council, there is neither an institutional representation of FEDECAMARAS nor the participation of independent trade unions in the Council. And yet there has been no agreement in the sectorial working groups of the Council which would permit to reach concrete solutions.
.Fourth, the complainants denounce new acts of",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
125,"intimidation towards FEDECAMARAS, contrary to the recent findings of the Committee on the Application of Standards of the th International Labour Conference, which urged the Government to immediately cease all acts of interference, aggression and stigmatization against FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated organizations and their leaders. In particular, the complainants indicate that, on  December , the President of the Republic stated publicly that FEDECAMARAS requested the repeal of the LOTTT, the Organic Law on Fair Prices and other regulations that protect people insinuating that the opposition parties and FEDECAMARAS hate the workers. The complainants further allege that, on  April and  May , the President of the Republic made accusations of intimidation against FEDECAMARAS and delivered statements instigating hatred against the institution, presenting the leaders as enemies of the workers. The complainants also refer to additional allegations of stigmatizing attacks raised in other cases before the Committee.
.Fifth, the organizations denounce the approval of a new increase in the minimum wage and the value of the socialist Cestaticket in February , without consulting with FEDECAMARAS and the statement by the President of the Republic that he was not willing to engage in a dialogue with the organization.
.Sixth, the complainants denounce the failure of the Government to implement the road map proposed to the Governing Body of the ILO in March , and they indicate that, at the date of their submission to the Committee, there has not been any meeting between the Government and FEDECAMARAS.
.In its communication of  October , the Government sent its observations with regard to the Committee s aforementioned recommendations.
.As regards recommendation (a) (allegation of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups or organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, its leaders and affiliated companies), the Government denies that there have been any attacks, persecution, harassment, intimidation or stigmatization against FEDECAMARAS. The Government indicates that, although the complainant organizations accuse the Government of threats of persecution and imprisonment, no FEDECAMARAS members are being detained or persecuted, even though the organization is responsible for actions that have created the climate of intimidation leading to the death of hundreds of people and serious harm to the nation. The Government indicates that some of these actions included participating in, funding and carrying out a coup d at, an illegal work stoppage by the employers, and sabotage of the oil industry, and it indicates that it has responded to these violent and continued actions by FEDECAMARAS, considering them not to be business-related but motivated by political interests that are opposed to Venezuelan democracy.
.As regards recommendation (b) (allegations of acts of violence and threats against FEDECAMARAS and its employer members, specifically as regards the abduction and mistreatment of FEDECAMARAS leaders), the Government indicates that, as regards the acts carried out against Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz, the trial of Mr Antonio Jos Silvia Moyega was concluded on  September  with him being sentenced to  years and eight months' imprisonment for the crimes of brief abduction, aggravated theft of a motor vehicle, criminal conspiracy and attempted homicide in the context of aggravated robbery against the victims. The Government indicates that the convicted person is being held in custody. The Government adds that it was demonstrated that it was a chance act perpetrated by a group of criminals and that it was not carried out against the victims because they were FEDECAMARAS employers' leaders. The Government adds that it will forward any additional information received from the Public Prosecutor s Office in relation to these cases.
.As regards recommendation (c) (allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders), the Government again indicates that in all cases of land recoveries, where the persons who occupy the land are able to demonstrate that they have made improvements to it, they are entitled to the respective compensation. The Government adds that, in recent years, under the policy for the recovery of agricultural land, many recoveries have been carried out on illegally occupied idle land where the occupants were not able to prove ownership, highlighting that only a minute proportion of the recoveries could have affected FEDECAMARAS leaders (the reported cases account for . per cent of the lands recovered). The Government considers that this demonstrates that it is not a case of retaliation against any employer. As regards Mr Eduardo Gmez Sgala, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Government again indicates that it was not a case of expropriation but that the lands were recovered because they were idle and the occupiers were not able to demonstrate their ownership; due process was followed and the regulations were complied with (in the case of Mr Garmendia, the recovery was limited to only part of the lands that he occupied, since he had only been able to demonstrate his ownership of another part, which is still in his possession). As regards the cases of Mr Egildo Lujn and Mr Vicente Brito, the Government again indicates that the National Land Institute reported that its archives contain no information on any recoveries or expropriations under the names of these leaders.
.As regards recommendation (d) (bipartite and tripartite social dialogue), the Government reiterates that social dialogue in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is conceived from a broad and inclusive perspective and that participation mechanisms should not be limited to the most representative organizations but should also include the whole spectrum of employers and workers. It indicates that consultation and participation is a constitutional mandate exercised through broad, inclusive, participatory and proactive social dialogue. It reports that consultations are carried out at all levels through participatory, inclusive social dialogue, even though certain organizations seek to exclude other organizations, exclude themselves or fail to attend consultations and working groups as a political strategy, which has not prevented hundreds of member employers' organizations from participating. The Government highlights, as a starting point, the Economic Conference for Peace, in which all the economic and social sectors were called upon to take part and in which  different working groups were set up, with the participation of the Government, workers and employers from the whole country with the aim of boosting the national economy. In this regard, the Government indicates that in  the Presidential Commission of Economic Affairs was established as one of the outcomes of the economic working groups, to boost the export of non-traditional products. Furthermore, the Government highlights the work carried out by the regional governments, which have organized many events to promote productive development, bringing together hundreds of employers. The Government also emphasizes that it has used the National Assembly as a platform to encourage meetings with national employers to promote the reactivation of the economy. While highlighting these examples of broad, inclusive, participatory and proactive social dialogue, the Government indicates that the leaders of FEDECAMARAS have themselves gone so far as to indicate their appreciation for this work, according to their statements in the national media. As examples of the work carried out with the employers' sector, with the participation of many enterprises, the Government draws attention to the International Chocolate Fair (October ) and the Sustainable Venezuela World Expo (September ).
.Furthermore, in its communication of  October , the Government forwards a letter of  October  sent by the People s Ministry of Labour to the President of FEDECAMARAS. It refers to two meetings held with FEDECAMARAS and indicates the Government s willingness to enter into broad social dialogue and to establish mechanisms that will give FEDECAMARAS a larger role in the discussion with a view to developing labour policies and labour-related legislation and regulations, requesting in particular the submission of proposals for the development of wage policies and of new implementing regulations for the Basic Act on Labour and Workers (LOTTT).
.As regards recommendation (e) (actions to create a climate of trust, including the appointment of a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council), the Government indicates that the Higher Labour Council was a body created to monitor the implementation of the LOTTT, and the transitional provisions of the LOTTT established that it would cease its functions three years after the approval of the act. Having approved the LOTT in May , the Government indicates that the LOTTT expired in May  and was no longer applicable.
.As regards recommendation (f) (allegations concerning detention, shadowing and harassment of leaders, escalation of verbal attacks and adoption of decree-laws without prior consultation of FEDECAMARAS), the Government provides the following information:(i) As regards the supposed detention of the former president of the Venezuelan Confederation of Industrialists (CONINDUSTRIA), Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the Government reports that he was not detained but that, on the contrary, he made his own way to the headquarters of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN), in compliance with a summons that he had received to answer questions on statements he had made in a national newspaper on how the outbreak of chikungunya would affect",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
126,"productivity (the Government indicates that the statements had been made without evidence, as he recognized). The Government points out that Mr Garmendia was treated courteously by the SEBIN officials who questioned him, and it requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of this matter.(ii) The Government also indicates that no organization is currently shadowing or harassing former FEDECAMARAS president Mr Jorge Roig; it therefore requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of the allegation.(iii) The Government denies the allegation of an escalation of the alleged attacks against FEDECAMARAS and indicates that there are no attacks or instances of persecution, harassment, intimidation or stigmatization against FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and members.(iv) As regards the alleged adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, the Government indicates that the discussion of laws and bills comes within the competence of the National Assembly and that national socio-economic policy comes within the competence of the Executive, in coordination with the other branches of government, without limiting the mechanisms for consultation and broad social dialogue that already exist and are implemented with the various sectors. Furthermore, the Government again reports to the Committee that article () of the Constitution grants the President of the Republic the possibility, subject to authorization under an enabling act, of issuing decrees with the force of law, indicating that enabling acts must be approved by three-fifths of the members of the National Assembly, in order to establish guidelines, objectives and the framework for matters delegated to the President of the Republic.
.As regards recommendation (g) (allegations of the detention of employers or leaders), the Government makes the following observations:(i) In the case of the  Da a Da Practimercados' supermarket chain, the Government reports that on  February  an inspection of the supermarket chain was carried out by a presidential commission and the Office of the National Superintendent for the Defence of Socio-Economic Rights (SUNDDE). It found irregularities in the distribution of goods, as a result of which Mr Manuel Andrs Morales Ordosgoitti and Mr Tadeo Arriechi, director-general and legal representative of the chain, respectively, are currently the subject of an investigation procedure by the Public Prosecutor s Office, the hearing for which was deferred on the request of their private defence.(ii) As regards the directors of the Corporacin Crnica company, the Government reports that, on  January , SUNDDE officials visited the establishment following complaints that it was selling goods at excessive prices. Irregularities were established during the inspection, leading to the seizure of more than  tonnes of hoarded meat products. As a result of this situation, the Government indicates that Ms Tania Carolina Salinas, Ms Delia Isabel Ribas, Ms Anllerlin Guadalupe Lpez Graterol, Mr Ernesto Luis Arenas Pulgar and Mr Yolman Javier Valderrama Santiago are currently being investigated by the Public Prosecutor s Office.(iii) As regards the case of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, the Government indicates that even though irregular situations affecting users had been detected, a hearing was held in the competent court for the review of the precautionary measure against Mr Pedro Luis Angarita and Mr Agustn lvarez, who are managers of the pharmacy network, in which the Public Prosecutor s Office issued a decree for their unconditional release. The Government therefore requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of this allegation.(iv) The Government indicates that there is no record of investigations against the president of the National Association of Supermarkets and Self-Service Stores (ANSA), Mr Luis Rodrguez, whose freedom is unrestricted. The Government therefore requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of this allegation. It adds that, on  February , an interview was held at SEBIN headquarters, after Mr Rodriguez had expressed his wish to provide information on the  Da a Da Practimercados' case.
.As regards recommendation (a) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, its leaders and affiliated companies), the Committee notes with deep regret that the Government is again using its reply to accuse the complainant organization and that it gives no indication that it has taken any measures to prevent acts and statements of stigmatization and intimidation, as the Committee had recommended. The Committee is therefore bound to reiterate its previous recommendation and urges the Government to take the requested measures without delay. A climate of violence, coercion and threats of any type aimed at trade union leaders and their families does not encourage the free exercise and full enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in Conventions Nos  and . All States have the undeniable duty to promote and defend a social climate where respect of the law reigns as the only way of guaranteeing respect for and protection of life [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.As regards recommendation (b) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of violence and threats against FEDECAMARAS and its member employers, specifically the abduction and mistreatment of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz in ), the Committee notes that one of the accused, Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega, was sentenced to  years and eight months' imprisonment for the crimes of brief abduction, aggravated theft of a motor vehicle, criminal conspiracy and attempted homicide in the context of aggravated robbery against the victims. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that it has been demonstrated that it was a criminal act which was not committed against the victims because they were FEDECAMARAS leaders. The Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the aforementioned ruling and to continue providing additional information concerning any penalties imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes and any compensation to FEDECAMARAS and to the leaders concerned for damage caused by those illegal acts. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the points raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters on  February . In this regard, the Committee recalls that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed; that a climate of violence, such as that surrounding the murder or disappearance of trade union leaders, or one in which the premises and property of workers and employers are attacked, constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; such acts require severe measures to be taken by the authorities; that the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events; and that the inviolability of trade union premises is a civil liberty which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights [see Digest, op. cit., paras , ,  and ].
.As regards recommendation (c) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders), observing that the Government reiterates previously submitted information and deeply regretting the absence of any indication of progress, the Committee reiterates its recommendation and urges the Government to take the requested measures without delay. In this regard, the Committee recalls that the confiscation of trade union property by the authorities, without a court order, constitutes an infringement of the right of trade unions to own property and undue interference in trade union activities [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.As regards recommendation (d) from its previous examination of the case (bipartite and tripartite social dialogue), the Government reiterates the information already provided on previous occasions concerning the broad, inclusive, participatory and proactive social dialogue that exists in the country, referring to certain recent initiatives in this regard. The Committee takes due note of the communication sent to the president of FEDECAMARAS and welcomes the provision that it makes to give FEDECAMARAS a larger role in the discussion with a view to developing labour policies and labour-related legislation and regulations, requesting in particular the submission of proposals for the development of wage policies and the new LOTTT regulations. However, the Committee observes that the Government does not provide any indications concerning the implementation of the plan of action recommended by the Governing Body. Regretting the lack of information and progress in this regard, the Committee reiterates its recommendation and urges the Government to take the requested measures without delay.
.As regards recommendation (e) from its previous examination of the case (actions to create a climate of trust, including the appointment of",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
127,"a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council), the Committee notes with regret that the Government merely indicates that the Higher Labour Council ceased its functions in May . The Committee has emphasized the importance it attaches to the promotion of dialogue and consultations on matters of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative occupational organizations of the sector involved [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Regretting the lack of information and expressing its deep concern at the lack of progress, the Committee regrets that the Government has not appointed a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the social dialogue body fulfilling its functions, and urges the Government to do so as soon as possible.
.As regards recommendation (f) from its previous examination of the case (allegations concerning detention, shadowing and harassment of leaders, escalation of verbal attacks and adoption of decree-laws without prior consultation of FEDECAMARAS), the Committee notes, firstly, the Government s statements to the effect that: (i) the president of CONINDUSTRIA, Mr Garmendia, was not detained but summoned, he made his own way to SEBIN headquarters, and he was treated courteously by the officials who questioned him regarding his statements on how the outbreak of chikungunya would affect productivity; and (ii) no organization is shadowing or harassing former FEDECAMARAS president Mr Jorge Roig. Noting the contradiction between the Government s reply and the allegations made by the complainants, the Committee invites the latter to provide the Government and the Committee with additional information, including any evidence they may have, and it urges the Government to carry out any relevant further investigation on the basis of such information.
.Secondly, the Committee notes the Government s statement denying the escalation of verbal attacks and indicating that there are no attacks or instances of persecution, harassment, intimidation or stigmatization against FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and members. However, the Committee recalls that throughout its examination of this case it has been witness to many serious accusations levelled against FEDECAMARAS by the Government, and it has noted with great concern the many allegations of attacks against this organization, emphasizing that all the allegations create a climate of intimidation against employers' organizations and their leaders, which is incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. . In this regard, the Committee regrets that it is bound to recall once again the principle whereby the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Digest, op. cit., para. ] and it firmly urges the Government to take the measures that are necessary both in this regard and to promote social dialogue based on respect.
.Thirdly, as regards the alleged adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with regret that the Government merely repeats information that it has already provided on the constitutional legal basis empowering the President of the Republic to issue decrees with the force of law, without making any observation concerning their relevance for or impact on social dialogue. The Committee is bound to point out once again that, over the years, when examining various complaints relating to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, it has noted the use in many cases of enabling legislation by the Legislative Assembly empowering the President of the Republic to adopt many decrees and laws that affect the interests of workers' and employers' organizations without a parliamentary debate being held [see, in particular, Case No. , th Report, para. ]. The Committee underlines that it is important that consultations take place in good faith, confidence and mutual respect, and that the parties have sufficient time to express their views and discuss them in full with a view to reaching a suitable compromise. The Government must also ensure that it attaches the necessary importance to agreements reached between workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee has also emphasized the value of consulting organizations of employers and workers during the preparation and application of legislation which affects their interests, and has drawn the attention of governments to the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Digest, op. cit., paras ,  and ]. Deeply deploring the persistence of this situation, the Committee firmly expects that full consultations will be held in the future with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS, on draft legislation covering labour or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members.
.As regards recommendation (g) from its previous examination of the case (detention of employers or leaders), in relation to the case of the supermarket chain  Da a Da Practimercados'  the Committee notes the Government s statements indicating that, having found irregularities in the distribution of goods in this supermarket chain, Mr Manuel Andrs Morales Ordosgoitti and Mr Tadeo Arriechi, director-general and legal representative, respectively, are currently undergoing investigation. Furthermore, as regards the case of the directors of the Corporacin Crnica company, the Committee notes that Ms Tania Carolina Salinas, Ms Delia Isabel Ribas, Ms Anllerlin Guadalupe Lpez Graterol, Mr Ernesto Luis Arenas Pulgar and Mr Yolman Javier Valderrama Santiago are currently being investigated by the Public Prosecutor s Office. Deeply regretting that no further information has been provided as requested regarding the allegations against these seven individuals under investigation, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether or not they are subject to precautionary or detention measures, to indicate the specific allegations against them, and to provide up-to-date information on the status of the procedures against them. The Committee recalls that the arrest of trade unionists and leaders of employers' organizations may create an atmosphere of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of trade union activities; and that in cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official, the Committee, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, has considered that it was incumbent upon the government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned [see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ].
.As regards the case of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, in which, according to the Government, Mr Pedro Luis Angarita and Mr Agustn lvarez were released unconditionally, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the charges against these individuals have been dropped or, if not, to indicate the specific allegations against them, and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings. In view of the complainants' allegation that four of the owners and managers of this pharmacy chain had been arrested, the Committee urges the Government to indicate whether any other individuals are currently under arrest or trial and it invites the complainants to provide the Government and the Committee with any detailed information that they may have on this matter.
.As regards the case of the president of the National Association of Supermarkets and Self-Service Stores (ANSA) and of the president of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, the Committee notes the Government s indication that they were both only interviewed at SEBIN headquarters, that there are no restrictions on their freedom, and that the Government therefore requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of these allegations. Noting the contradiction between the Government s reply and the allegations made by the complainants, the Committee invites the latter to provide the Government and the Committee with additional information on this matter, including any available evidence, and urges the Government, on the basis of such information, to carry out any relevant additional investigations and to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Committee notes with great concern the new allegations of the IOE and FEDECAMARAS dated  May , in which it is alleged: (i) the enactment in December , without consultation with the social partners, of  national laws, including the law on job security; (ii) semblance of dialogue through communications to FEDECAMARAS by the Government, when it has already announced or adopted the measures concerned; (iii) the unilateral promulgation without prior consultation of the Decree of the President of the Republic declaring a state of emergency for economic hardship; (iv) new acts of intimidation against FEDECAMARAS; (v) approval without consultation of a new increase in the minimum wage and the value of the socialist Cestaticket in February ; and (vi) failure by the Government to implement the road map presented to the Governing Body of the ILO in March . The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay so that the Committee can examine all the relevant elements.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
128,"Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While once again expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops and the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the urgency of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b) As regards the abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), while noting the sentencing of one of the accused to  years and eight months' imprisonment, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the ruling issued and to continue providing additional information concerning any penalties imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes, and concerning any compensation to FEDECAMARAS and to the leaders concerned for damage caused by those illegal acts. Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its request to the Government to send its observations concerning the points raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters on  February .(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee insists that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which in turn refers to  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee regrets that the Government stated in previous communications that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable and that, in its latest communication, it merely indicates that it proceeded in compliance with the law. The Committee firmly urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Lastly, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee regrets the lack of information and further progress in this regard. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission also refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Observing that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meetings held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February and October , and to implement tripartite consultations immediately.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee regrets that the Government has not appointed a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the social dialogue body fulfilling its functions, and urges the Government to do so as soon as possible.(f) The Committee, having noted the Government s observations concerning the allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors, regrets that once again a full answer has not been provided in relation to the individuals who are the subject of investigation procedures. As regards the cases of Corporacin Crnica and the  Da a Da Practimercados' chain, the Committee urges the Government to indicate the specific allegations against the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities, and not merely give an indication of general criminal offences, and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings and their compliance with precautionary or detention measures. The Committee again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on employers' and business leaders pending trial. As regards the allegation of the detention of the managers of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the charges against these individuals have been dropped or, if not, to indicate the specific allegations against them and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings; and, in view of the complainants' allegation that four of the owners and managers of this pharmacy chain had been arrested, the Committee urges the Government to indicate whether any other individuals are currently under arrest or trial, and it invites the complainant organizations to provide the Government and the Committee with any detailed information that they may have on this matter.(g) As regards the allegations of the detention of the president of CONINDUSTRIA, Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the president of ANSA, Mr Luis Rodrguez, and the president of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Mr Rosales Briceo, and allegations of shadowing and harassment of the president of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Jorge Roig, given the divergences between the allegations and the Government s reply, the Committee invites the complainants to provide the Government and the Committee with additional information, including any evidence they may have, and it urges the Government, on the basis of such information, to carry out any relevant additional investigations and to keep the Committee informed on this matter.(h) As regards the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, the Committee regrets that the Government has not made any observation concerning their impact on social dialogue and, deeply deploring the persistence of this situation, it firmly expects that full consultations will be held in the future with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS, on draft legislation covering labour or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members.(i) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(j) The Committee notes with great concern the new allegations of the IOE and FEDECAMARAS dated  May , in which it is alleged: (i) the enactment in December , without consultation with the social partners, of  national laws, including the law on job security; (ii) semblance of dialogue through communications to FEDECAMARAS by the Government, when it has already announced or adopted the measures concerned; (iii) the unilateral promulgation without prior consultation of the Decree of the President of the Republic declaring a state of emergency for economic hardship; (iv) new acts of intimidation against FEDECAMARAS; (v) approval without consultation of a new increase in the minimum wage and the value of the socialist Cestaticket in February ; and (vi) failure by the Government to implement the road map presented to the Governing Body of the ILO in March . The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay so that the Committee can examine all the relevant elements.(k)",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
129,"The Committee once again draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  session, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (March )].
.On that occasion, it requested the Government [see th Report, para. , recommendation (g)] to complete its response on certain issues and indicated its intention to consider them in detail at its May  meeting.
.In a communication dated  May , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS provided additional information.
.The Government sent additional observations in a communication dated  May .

.In its previous examination of the case at its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) While expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee draws the Government s attention to the importance of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.(b) The Committee notes with regret that the criminal proceedings relating to the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February  and the abduction and mistreatment in  of the leaders of that organization, Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds) have not yet been completed (FEDECAMARAS appealed against the ruling ordering the closure of the case concerning the bomb attack on its headquarters), again expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded without further delay, and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the issues raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee requests that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  and regrets that the Government stated in its last communication that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable.

Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it has not yet concluded the process of consultation with different sectors and organizations and requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high level tripartite mission. Noting that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon.

The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee further requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose any problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee notes with concern the new allegations by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS of  November  concerning: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, president of CONINDUSTRIA, for  hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, president of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level state officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee requests the Government to send complete observations on these allegations.(g) The Committee notes with concern the new allegations from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS and takes note of the recent Government observations on some of the allegations. The Committee requests the Government to complete its response and intends to review the issues raised therein in a detailed manner at its next meeting in May .(h) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In respect of recommendation (g), the report on the previous examination of the case only contains a very brief summary of the allegations and the responses from the Government as these were only received shortly before the Committee s March  meeting. Accordingly, a detailed account of the said allegations and the responses from the Government is provided below.
.In a communication of  March , the IOE and the Venezuelan business association FEDECAMARAS denounce once again the continuing harassment of the country s free employers by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and protest to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO about new attacks on the private sector and on private Venezuelan companies, many of which are members of FEDECAMARAS, the county s most representative employers' organization. This tactic comprises new acts of aggression and public vilification by the Venezuelan Government targeted against Venezuelan companies and employers, which in the month of February  alone resulted in the sudden detention of more than  employers and managers of companies distributing food and medicines and of private union organizations providing in-patient care, supermarket servicing and meat distribution, along with the de facto seizure, by the Government, of a private food-distribution company, accusing it of conspiring against the Government, without due process or respect for their right to defence, incidents which have been widely publicized by the media.
.The complainant organizations recall that, one year ago, in March , the ILO officially requested the Venezuelan Government to urgently adopt an action plan to launch a social dialogue in the country based on respect and the absence of intimidation against independent and representative employers' and trade union organizations. This insistent request was prompted by concerns relating to violation of the right to freedom of association and the freedom to form trade unions of employers and workers in the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
130,"country and was reflected in detail in the report submitted by the ILO high-level mission on its visit to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in January , which was approved by the Governing Body on  March . In that report, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was also requested to ensure that rapid and effective steps were taken to prosecute acts of violence against representatives of employers' and trade union organizations. That notwithstanding, the new attacks in February  are cause for serious concern, demonstrating that the launch of a social dialogue in the country based on respect and the absence of intimidation against independent and representative employers' and trade union organizations is far from being a reality in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.The IOE and FEDECAMARAS allege that, on  February , four of the owners and managers of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, including the Executive President of the chain, Pedro Luis Angarita and his operations Vice-President, Agustn Antonio lvarez Costa, were detained in connection with the queues formed by consumers at the doors of their distribution centres for medicines and other personal hygiene items which are in short supply in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Government saw this as a deliberate delaying tactic designed to undermine and discredit the Government in the eyes of consumers, and accused them of  conspiracy' and  waging an economic war against the Government'  The President of the country went on radio and television to inform the public that the owners of FARMATODO had been detained and were being held in the cells of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) and that charges against them had been lodged with the Office of the Attorney-General. The offences with which the FARMATODO directors were charged carried penalties of ten to  years' imprisonment.
.On  February , the company issued a statement to its workers emphasizing its willingness to cooperate with a view to ensuring the prompt availability of essential items and to continue providing services to its clients.
.On  February, the President of FEDECAMARAS, Jorge Roig, condemned the actions taken by the Venezuelan Government against the management of FARMATODO. He declared that measures of that kind taken by the authorities formed part of a campaign of  absolute and exclusive persecution against Venezuelan private enterprise'  The President of FEDECAMARAS deplored the  demonizing' of the business sector, which was being put  on trial without any conclusive evidence and without letting us hear the injured parties' side of the story'  He stressed that the pharmacy chain must be given a fair trial, noting that  we e heard nothing from the injured party' and that  these investigations have degenerated into summary trials' 
.The complainant organizations also allege that, on  February , the President of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, the Vice-President for Food Security and Self Sufficiency, Carlos Osorio, the Minister for Food, Yvn Bello, and officials from the National Fair Pricing Authority (SUNDDE) inspected the storerooms of the Da a Da supermarket in Caracas, which, according to a declaration by Mr Cabello, were seized by the Government because of irregularities detected in the sale of products and the large inventory that they contained. On instructions from the President of the Republic, according to Mr Cabello, seizure of the entire network of Da a Da supermarkets was ordered, from the warehouses, to the distribution areas and sales outlets, all of which were then transferred to the State food distribution service, the Venezuelan Food Production and Distribution Board (PDVAL). On  February, the Governor of the State of Aragua announced that four more storerooms of the Da a Da chain had been seized in that state, full of  hoarded' supplies.
.On  February , at the warehouses of the Da a Da minimarket chain, situated in Caracas, eight lorries from the national Government Food Mission, escorted by PDVAL officials, inspectors from SUNDDE and the Bolivarian National Guard, loaded up goods for delivery to  branches of the chain and to PDVAL premises.
.On  February , the President of the Republic announced that, as from  February, the PDVAL state-owned network would be taking over all the services of Da a Da, accusing the latter of waging war against the Venezuelan people. He also urged the judicial authorities and the Public Prosecutor s Office to initiate proceedings against those responsible for offences against the people in this economic war, from this chain in particular, which had now been taken over by the PDVAL, and to ensure that they paid in full and  to show no mercy to these mafias which are harming our people'  He also instructed the Public Prosecutor s Office to determine the material damage caused to society and the State through the conduct of  economic warfare by this group' 
.On  February , Da a Da issued a communiqu explaining that it was quite normal for most of the company s stock to be stored in its central warehouse, and that this stock generally only covered a few days of sales. Where staples were concerned, and in particular maize meal, the warehouse generally held no more than three days of stock for sales in all the chain s outlets of  tonnes per day. It insisted that there was neither any hoarding nor a boycott.
.Francisco Martnez, the First Vice-President of FEDECAMARAS, maintained that the unremitting attacks against the private sector were a source of concern to FEDECAMARAS, which was alarmed that it should be deemed an offence to hold three days of stock.
.On  February , the President of Da a Da explained that the legal arrangements for the company s incorporation into the State food distribution network, PDVAL, still had not been worked out.  We do not know'  he said,  if this is expropriation, or interference, or what. All we know is that our director-general is in prison. ' Our supplies have been taken and are being invoiced by PDVAL' 
.The complainant organizations further indicate that, on  February , SEBIN detained the directors of the Da a Da supermarket chain and Luis Rodrguez, President of the National Association of Supermarkets and Self-Services (ANSA). They were detained as they left a meeting which had been called by the Government in the Palace of Miraflores, with the Vice-President for Food Security and Self-Sufficiency, Carlos Osorio, to discuss the issue of supplies in the country.
.The complainant organizations add that, on  February , the Government seized the meat distributor Corporacin Crnica  and detained its owners. The head of SUNDDE announced the detention of five managers from the company in the State of Falcn, for having sold meat, chicken and fish at a mark-up of up to , per cent, and on suspicion of the offence of hoarding. At a meeting with representatives of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), the State President announced that the company had been seized by the Government and that it would now become part of the PDVAL network. During the extended plenary meeting of the PSUV, Diosdado Cabello, President of the National Assembly, requested President Maduro personally to preside over the Corporacin Crnica take-over operation in the State of Falcn. The Head of State announced that the company would be handed over to the PDVAL State network.
.The IOE and FEDECAMARAS allege that, on  February , eight SEBIN officials detained the President of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Dr Carlos Rosales Briceo, in his practice in the city of Valencia, in Carabobo State. The SEBIN officials ordered the doctor to accompany them to the regional headquarters. It is assumed that Dr Rosales s detention was prompted by recent statements that he had made regarding the shortage of medicines and supplies necessary to protect the lives and health of Venezuelans in clinics and hospitals, in which he had urged the Venezuelan authorities to respond to the emergency. Dr Rosales said, after his release, that SEBIN had informed him that his statements to the media  might have caused alarm among the population and were not objective' 
.In their communication dated  May , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS reiterate their previous allegations and submit press clipping summaries of statements of an intimidating nature made by the President of the Republic and other authorities against FEDECAMARAS and its leaders, in which they are also accused of criminal offences and carrying out an economic war. These press clippings include statements that were also made in the month of April .
.In its communication dated  March , the Government stated that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was currently suffering from threats and sanctions imposed from abroad with a view to destabilizing the country. Clear evidence of these destabilizing threats had been provided to various community organizations and international agencies such as the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), the Bolivarian Alliance of the Peoples of Our America ' Peoples Trade Treaty (ALBA TCP),",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
131,"the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which took a unanimous position against these attempts to interfere in the country and to destabilize its democratic system.
.As part of this economic war, blatantly conspiratorial political and economic groups had expended huge sums of money buying essential items which were then sent out of the country, hidden away or simply destroyed to prevent them being distributed to the population. In the month of January  alone, there was a difference of  per cent in the quantity of such items distributed than in the same month of the previous year. This sabotage of the country s economy had led to the emergence of a black market in commodities and to turmoil in the population, comparable to that which developed in Chile in the months preceding the coup d at against President Allende that led to the Pinochet dictatorship.
.The political aims of this economic sabotage were clear and were demonstrated by countless political statements calling for sedition, for acts of looting and violence or, quite blatantly, for the overthrow of the legitimate Government of President Nicols Maduro.
.The incitements to acts of violence had fallen on deaf ears, because the population had stoically endured the queues necessary for controlled items, caused by their withdrawal from distribution and disappearance.
.Despite the attacks, the people had firmly maintained their attachment to democracy, independence and to the gains that had been made to uphold the Bolivarian revolution and the legacy of the Supreme Commander, Hugo Chvez Fras.
.Thanks to organized action by trade unions and local councils, which had set up inspection, investigation and information-gathering teams to combat hoarding and speculation, the country was successfully resisting the economic war and was able to detect semi-clandestine stashes of commodities and instances of the buying up of commodities so that they could be taken out of circulation and reappear outside the normal distribution channels at inflated prices.
.The Government stated that that action has led to the arrest of many unscrupulous traders, who ' regrettably ' were  employers' engaged in speculation, hoarding and the smuggling of goods for profiteering purposes, all designated as offences under the law, as they were in many other countries. Some of those  employers' were managers or owners of large distribution companies belonging to important economic groups. Despite their membership of those important economic groups, they had been treated exactly the same as small-scale employers, and they had been accorded their constitutional right to defence and due process.
.In October ,  kilometres from Caracas, several storehouses had been found containing medical, surgical and pharmaceutical equipment sufficient to supply the needs of the hospital network for six months. To give an idea of the hoard, it had included  million syringes and  million pairs of gloves, at the very time when the media, both national and international, were highlighting  the absence of medical and surgical equipment' in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, specifying in particular syringes and gloves. The medical supply companies Javoy and Suplidora Hospimed  had received $ million from the Venezuelan Government for the import of supplies that had then been withheld from the public. The owners of those companies were now fugitives from justice.
.In January , the company Distribuidora Herrera CA had been seized, with more than , tonnes of essential foodstuffs. In both cases, many of the items had been distributed to businesses and then, anomalously, had gone back into storage and were being repackaged to be illegally spirited out of the country. The main shareholder of that company was the firm Diamond Trading Investments Ltd., based in Barbados, whose owner was Ms Peggy Ordaz, now a fugitive from justice, an activist in the Voluntad Popular party, which had been linked to the coup attempts in  and whose main leader was currently in detention, charged with provoking the violent activities known as  guarimbas' during .
.While both cases had been reviewed extensively in the national press, they had been omitted from the press clippings accompanying the communication from FEDECAMARAS, despite their direct link with the facts being reported. Investigations and intelligence operations had led to the arrest of the owners of the pharmaceutical and food distribution chains, FARMATODO and Da a Da. That was not action taken against some trade union activity by the accused ' there had not in fact been any such activity ' but a normal and legal response to offences connected with organized crime.
.Representatives of the company Corporacin Crnica  had been arrested because they were found to be selling meat and poultry outside regular distribution channels and at prices inflated to ten times the value of the product, the price of which is regulated because it is categorized as a basic necessity. In that case too, the owners of the meat distributor had not been engaged in any trade union activity but were carrying out reprehensible actions of hoarding and speculation, to the detriment of the Venezuelan people.
.All those cases related to specific events involving citizens suspected of the commission of an offence and it was now up to the judicial system to determine whether or not they were guilty. Their status as  employers' was entirely circumstantial. Almost all Venezuelan employers dissociated themselves from that situation and instead condemned the offences of hoarding and speculation which had been impeding the normal development of the country s economy.
.Accordingly, the legal and judicial actions based on the country s law which had been taken against some of the owners or representatives of those companies or chains had nothing to do with and were not in any way linked to their status as employers, but were prompted by their suspected involvement in offences established in Venezuelan law and for which they must be brought to justice, whether they were employers or not.
.The country s worker President, Nicols Maduro, had extended an invitation to all national and international businesses that believed in work ' and they made up the vast majority. To date, in , as part of efforts to resist the economic war,  meetings had been held with chambers, associations and various unions of employers, in a productive social dialogue that had served to isolate certain criminal groups which had been masquerading as businesses or employers.
.The communication from FEDECAMARAS was very specific, noting situations that had arisen, including between  and  February . It was noteworthy that, in his communication, the President of FEDECAMARAS had omitted to mention that, on  February ' namely, after the events in question ' President Maduro had called all business sectors to a  national dialogue, to consider proposals on the economy' and for that purpose had appointed the employers' leader, Miguel Perez Abad, President of FEDEINDUSTRIA, one of the main employers' organizations in the country, as presidential commissioner for economic matters.
.On Thursday,  February, Mr Abad had met representatives of FEDECAMARAS. The importance of that meeting had been affirmed by Jorge Roig, President of FEDECAMARAS and one of the signatories of the communication in reference, who had said:  Maduro has made a positive decision to call all sectors to a dialogue on the economy .... We all undoubtedly share the aim of ensuring the adequate and continued supply of food to the country and meeting their daily material needs .... We also concur in our resolute and categorical rejection of all hoarding, speculation and smuggling, offences against commercial and business ethics which should be punished with the full force of the law.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Government attached in full the statements by Mr Roig, President of FEDECAMARAS, and the statement issued by FEDECAMARAS the following week. They made no mention of situations like those described in the complaint currently before the Committee on Freedom of Association, even though they had occurred only the previous week.
.The Government stated that it did not understand how, just two weeks after those public statements by the civil association FEDECAMARAS, a communication could have been issued containing phrases like  assault on the business community'   attacks on private companies'   acts of aggression and discrediting the public'  which were quite inconsistent with the real situation in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and with the statements issued by the leaders of that same civil association. It was precisely that kind of ambiguous behaviour by FEDECAMARAS and its duplicitous political game which was undermining the confidence of the Venezuelan people in the sincerity of that civil association and of other such civil associations, and which regrettably had led it to withdraw from the social dialogue under way in the country, despite the numerous appeals by the President himself.
.What made that situation particularly serious, in the Government s view, was that citizens engaged in business activity were the ones perpetrating the offences. It was not a matter of attacks against entrepreneurship, but the actions of a small group of citizens who were suspected of having committed offences and it was now up to the Venezuelan",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
132,"judicial authorities to establish responsibility. Nor was it a matter of union harassment, since the vast majority of those concerned were not attached to any union, but routine arrests of persons engaged in the commission of offences which were condemned by FEDECAMARAS itself. It was now up to the courts to determine whether or not they were guilty, while guaranteeing that all detainees received due process and the right to defence, as were guaranteed to every citizen of the country.
.The Government claimed that there was some motive behind the complaint to the ILO to follow up on judgments handed down in the country for offences committed by citizens against the Venezuelan people, and that these had nothing to do with persecution, harassment or aggression against businesses or employers.
.Where the request by the IOE was concerned, the country would have due respect for human rights, in accordance with the political obligation of those now running the Government, who stood in a long tradition in the country of active defenders of human rights and had themselves been the victims of violations of their own rights in the past. Furthermore, no ILO Convention stated that the punishment or liabilities incurred by such activities and offences as smuggling, speculation and hoarding could be described as persecution or the harassment of unions; quite the reverse, it was to defend the human rights of the people that the Government had acted against those offences.
.Lastly, the Government categorically rejected the claim to this international body that those acts were offences against the Venezuelan people, measures that  may create a climate of intimidation impeding the normal conduct of activities by employers' organizations and their members and their exercise of their freedom of association and the rights enshrined in Convention No. '  It reaffirmed the full compliance by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela with freedom of association and the right to organize and, specifically, with Convention No. ; and it pointed out once again that the commission of offences punishable under the law by any citizens, regardless of their status or situation, if detected and proved by the judicial authorities, would incur the corresponding penalties.
.In its communication of  March , the Government indicated that it had requested the Attorney-General s Office to provide all details of the latest allegations by the complainants, so that it could urgently and promptly respond to those allegations, regarding the supposed detention without due process and without the right to defence, during the month of February , of  employers and managers of companies distributing food and medicines or providing in-patient hospital care.
.The Attorney-General s Office gives updates of the proceedings against suspects in the following cases:' FARMATODO pharmaceutical chain: Proceedings have been initiated against the citizens Pedro Luis Angarita and Agustin Alvarez, who were apprehended in the act, for the offences of boycotting and destabilizing the economy, and their preventive judicial detention has been authorized by Control Court No.  of the criminal judicial circuit of the Caracas metropolitan area (Supervisory Court). The case is currently at the investigation stage.' Da a Da supermarket and minimarket chains: Proceedings have been instituted against the citizens Manuel Andrs Morales Ordosgoitti and Tadeo Arriechi, the first of whom was apprehended in the act and the second taken into custody under an arrest warrant for the offences of boycotting and destabilizing the economy, and their preventive judicial detention has been authorized by Control Court No.  of the Caracas metropolitan area (Supervisory Court). In addition, the governing body of SUNDDE has ordered the administrative measure of temporary seizure of the Da a Da facilities, under an administrative order dated  February , and the case is currently at the investigation stage.
.With regard to the ANSA, it confirms that there is no criminal investigation against the citizen Luis Rodrguez, who holds the position of president of the said association.' Corporacin Crnica: Proceedings have been initiated against the citizens Tania Carolina Salinas (apprehended in the act and placed in judicial preventive detention), Delia Isabel Ribas (apprehended in the act and taken into precautionary pre-trial custody), Angelly Lopez Graterol (apprehended in the act and taken into precautionary pre-trial custody), Ernesto Luis Arenas Pulgar (apprehended in the act and taken into precautionary pre-trial custody) and Yolman Valderrama apprehended in the act and taken into precautionary pre-trial custody), on charges of boycotting, hoarding, fraudulently misrepresenting the quality of goods, price rigging, selling expired foodstuffs, criminal conspiracy and speculation. The case is currently at the investigation stage with Circuit Court No.  with jurisdiction for economic and cross border offences in the judicial district of Falcn State (Supervisory Court) and Circuit Court No.  with jurisdiction for Falcn State (Supervisory Court). In addition, the governing body of SUNDDE has ordered the administrative measure of temporary seizure, under an administrative order dated  January ).
.Where the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals is concerned, the Attorney General s Office indicates that there is no criminal investigation against the citizen Rafael Guerra Mndez, President of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals. On  February , however, he was questioned at the headquarters of the SEBIN in connection with statements that he had made to the media.
.The Attorney-General s Office concludes by emphasizing that, in accordance with the principles of law and justice enshrined in the Venezuelan Constitution, the right to defence is conceived as a guarantee of due process, which is applicable to all judicial and administrative proceedings; accordingly, when citizens are being prosecuted for the alleged commission of acts defined as punishable under law, not only are their rights recognized, the exercise of those rights is also guaranteed.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that it confirms its reply sent on  February  concerning this case since what had been asked was sufficiently answered on that occasion. Moreover, the Government confirms each of its previous replies pertaining to the recommendations contained in the report of the ILO tripartite mission which visited the country in January , as well as any other reply which is relevant to this case.
.With regard to the trial held in relation to the bombing of the FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Government states that the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic has notified that, as regards the criminal case on the attack of the FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the th Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the metropolitan area of Caracas issued an acquittal verdict of the accused, Ms Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, on public intimidation charges and misuse of identification. However, following an appeal filed by the Public Prosecutor, a hearing was held on  April  and the Court of Appeals of the Criminal Judicial Circuit used the delay granted by law to render a decision. The court decision is still pending.
.With regard to the trial concering acts committed against Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz, the Government states that the accused, despite having been duly notified, failed to appear in Court. The Government adds that the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic has indicated that once the continuation of the oral and public proceedings before the Eleventh Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the Caracas metropolitan area was scheduled to commence, it had to be interrupted on  January  due to the decision of the accused to dismiss his lawyer. The Court will therefore set a new date for the commencement of the oral and public proceedings, once the accused appoints his new legal representative.
.With regard to the Committee s recommendation (g), in its previous examination of the case, the Committee recalls that, in its March  conclusions:' The Committee notes with concern the allegation contained in the recent joint communication from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS, that  entrepreneurs from various sectors, including the President of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals and the President of the National Association of Supermarkets and Self-Services, Luis Rodrguez, were detained in February  without due process and in violation of the right of defence, as well as other allegations (seizure of company premises, threat of expropriation). The Committee notes the Government s communications of  and  March  denying attacks on business and stating that there are no criminal proceedings against the two employer leaders mentioned by the complainants, (Luis Rodrguez and Rafael Guerra Mndez), reporting the prosecution of eight enterprise managers for offences of an economic nature, and reporting also that, as regards the eight enterprise managers, the judicial authority has taken measures for their preventive detention or alternative precautionary measures [see th Report, para. ].
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not sent the supplementary information that the Committee had requested in relation to the allegations of the IOE and FEDECAMARAS mentioned in recommendation (g) and that it has not even sent information on developments in the criminal proceedings initiated against most of the leaders or employers whose",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
133,"arrest has been alleged, despite the Committee having deemed the case to be extremely serious and having therefore drawn the Governing Body s special attention to it. The Committee expresses its concern, noting that it is alleged that some detainees might be condemned to '  years of imprisonment.
.Since the Government s most recent reply limits itself to confirming its previous statements concerning the allegations of detention of business persons and employers' leaders, the occupation of business premises and the seizure of goods, the Committee emphasizes the importance of having the supplementary information requested, given the contradiction between the allegations and the Government s response as to whether or not it has complied with the rules of due process, whether or not economic offences have been committed, whether or not there has been an attack on employers and their officials and, whether or not there are ulterior motives which have nothing to do with defending the interests of employers' organizations and their members. The Committee stresses in particular the important need for the Government to indicate the specific allegations against each of the employers or leaders mentioned in the complaint, and not to limit itself to an indication of the general criminal offences (boycott, hoarding, smuggling, speculation, etc.). The Committee urges the Government to provide this information together with information on developments in the respective criminal proceedings. The Committee also requests the Government to forward its observations regarding the latest additional information on these questions that the IOE and FEDECAMARAS have transmitted in their communication dated  May . The Committee calls on the authorities to consider lifting the precautionary custodial measures imposed on employers and business leaders pending trial.
.With regard to the recommendation (b), the Committee observes with concern from the Government s statements that the criminal proceedings in question have not yet been completed. The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendations.
.With regard to recommendations (a) and (c)' f), that it issued in relation to other aspects of the case, the Committee expresses its deep concern, observing the lack of information and lack of any progress; reiterates its previous conclusions and recommendations and urges the Government to take the requested measures without delay. More particularly, the Committee expresses its deep concern, observing that in their allegations of  May , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS indicated new acts of intimidation and stigmatization against the latter and its leaders by the authorities, including in April .
.In general, the Committee expresses its grave concern at the specific situation regarding the rights of freedom of association of FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and its members.
.In the view of the above interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of carrying out an economic war, the occupation and looting of stores, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee wishes to point out to the Government the importance of strong measures to avoid such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.(b) The Committee notes with regret that the criminal proceedings relating to the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February  and the abduction and maltreatment in  of the leaders of that organization, Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Albis Muoz (the last-mentioned sustaining three bullet wounds) have not yet been completed, again expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded without further delay, and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the issues raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee requests that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  and regrets that the Government stated in its last communication that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable. The Committee urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it has not yet concluded the process of consultation with different sectors and organizations and requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chair. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Noting that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meeting held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February , and immediately to implement tripartite consultations.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee further requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose any problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee notes with concern the allegations by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS of  November  concerning: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, President of CONINDUSTRIA, for  hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, President of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level State officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee requests the Government to send complete observations on these allegations.(g) The Committee notes with concern new allegations from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS and the observations by the Government of  and  March  on some of the allegations. The Committee once again requests the Government to complete its response, to indicate the specific allegations against each of the  employers or managers from the different sectors who have been detained or placed under precautionary measures by the judicial authorities, and not to limit itself to an indication of the general criminal offences (boycott, hoarding, smuggling, speculation, etc.), and also to provide information on developments in the respective judicial proceedings. The Committee also requests the Government to forward its observations concerning the latest additional information transmitted by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS in their communication dated  May . The Committee intends to examine these serious issues in a",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
134,"detailed manner, in full knowledge of the facts, and requests the authorities to consider lifting the precautionary custodial measures imposed on employers and business leaders pending trial.(h) The Committee expresses its deep concern, observing the lack of information and any progress on the previous recommendations and firmly urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay, including with regard to the new allegations of acts of intimidation and stigmatization against FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and members by the authorities, contained in its communication of  May .(i) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see nd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (June )].
.The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers and Associations of Commerce and Production (FEDECAMARAS) subsequently sent joint communications dated  November  and  March . The Government sent additional information in communications dated  October ,  February and  and  March .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case at its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see nd Report, para. ]:(a) While expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of carrying out an economic war, the occupation and looting of stores, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee wishes to point out to the Government the importance of strong measures to avoid such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee once again draws the Government s attention to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers and employers can develop only in a climate free from violence, intimidation and fear, as such insecure situations are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. . The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for this principle.(b) The Committee regrets that the criminal proceedings relating to the bombing of the headquarters of FEDECAMARAS on  February  and the kidnapping and maltreatment in  of the leaders of that organization, Noel Alvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter was wounded by three bullets) have not yet been completed, expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators of those crimes are sentenced in a manner commensurate with the severity of the crimes, so that such crimes are not repeated, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of employers' leaders or former leaders, the Committee reiterates recommendations (e) and (f) of its previous examination of the case, requesting that those leaders or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises (including the new information communicated to the mission) and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future' and regrets that in its last communication the Government stated that a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates is not viable. The Committee urges the Government to implement this request and to report thereon. Furthermore, the Committee, as did the mission, notes with concern the information provided about new acts of recovery, occupation and expropriation of the property of an employers' leader of FEDECAMARAS. Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) In relation to the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, together with the elaboration of specific steps and concrete time frames for its implementation, and counting upon the technical assistance of the ILO recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that it has initiated a process of consultation with different sectors. It requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the mission in its conclusions referred to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. Noting with regret that the Government has not yet provided a plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and expresses the firm hope that it will take, in the very near future, all steps necessary to do so and will report thereon.(e) Finally, the Committee, guided by the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, stresses the importance of immediate action being taken to create a climate of trust based on the respect of business and labour organizations, so as to promote stable and solid industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures in this regard. The Committee requests the Government as a first step in the right direction to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of the matters dealt with in this case.
.In their communication of  November , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS state that the Government is still ignoring the recommendations made by the high-level tripartite mission. They also report new violations of Conventions Nos  and , particularly: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, president of CONINDUSTRIA, for  hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, president of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level state officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS.
.In a communication dated  March , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS denounce, among other allegations, the detention, in February , without due process and in violation of the right of defence, of  entrepreneurs from various sectors including the Chairperson of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Dr Carlos Rosales Briceno, and the Chairperson of the National Association of Supermarkets and Self-Services, Mr Luis Rodriguez.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government reiterated its previous statements. Concerning recommendation (a), made during the previous examination of the case, the Government states that, with regard to what the Committee considers to be various and serious forms of stigmatization by the authorities directed against FEDECAMARAS, there is a long tradition of complaints of this type; FEDECAMARAS members have expressed public, and even insulting, opinions to representatives of the Government.
.The Government maintains that, in drawing attention to any  stigmatizing statements' by members of the Government, the Committee on Freedom of Association should bear in mind that: () it is common knowledge that FEDECAMARAS openly participated as an organization in the planning and implementation of a coup d at; () it is common knowledge that FEDECAMARAS financed and collaborated in the occupation of a square for over two months by active military personnel, who declared that they were in an armed revolt against the legitimately formed Government; () FEDECAMARAS participated in, financed and implemented an illegal stoppage and sabotage of the oil industry with the announced intention of forcing the constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to resign; and () FEDECAMARAS publicly supported landowners' call for the defence of their land, including through armed attacks by paramilitary",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
135,"groups that caused the deaths of hundreds of rural leaders. These are merely the events that are common knowledge and there is no doubt that FEDECAMARAS participated directly in them as an organization.
.As the Committee has stated, the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, intimidation and fear. However, the Government maintains that, to its knowledge, FEDECAMARAS has never been called upon to halt its activities, which, owing to the climate that they have generated, have led to some statements that might be considered  stigmatizing' in so far as it was accused of acts that were characteristic of its past behaviour. It is not the statements by members of the Government but the actions of FEDECAMARAS that have caused the people of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to hate this organization. Although threats of imprisonment and persecution are mentioned in its allegations, none of the FEDECAMARAS members responsible for the aforementioned acts, which led to the deaths of hundreds of people and to the unlawful detention of the constitutional President and caused serious harm to the nation, have been arrested, thereby creating a situation of impunity that hinders the creation of a climate of trust. The Government requests the Committee to advise FEDECAMARAS to make the necessary public apology for the aforementioned acts and others that it has committed as an act of contrition which is a prerequisite for a climate of trust that will ease tensions in the wake of the statements made by both parties.
.With respect to recommendation (b) (alleged acts of violence, threats against FEDECAMARAS and its member employers and, specifically, the abduction and mistreatment of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel Alvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villasmil and Ms Albis Muoz), the Government states that it has already reported that the perpetrators have been arrested and are in custody; that this was an instance of common crime having nothing to do with the victims' status as employers' leaders or members of FEDECAMARAS; and that the victim (Ms Muoz) has already stated, in a written communication, that she does not plan to participate in the proceedings conducted by the Public Prosecutor s Office, which she considers to be acting appropriately. The Government therefore requests the Committee on Freedom of Association not to pursue its examination of this case since it obviously has nothing to do with matters relating to freedom of association and it has been repeatedly reported that the perpetrators are in custody.
.With regard to the alleged attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in February , the Government states that it reported several times that the perpetrator had been identified and found guilty and has since died; it therefore requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of this matter.
.Concerning recommendation (c) (allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders), the Government states, with respect to the alleged seizure of farms belonging to employers' leaders Mr Eduardo Gmez Sgala, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, that the Ministry of Agriculture and Land and the National Land Institute (INTI) have reported that, in the case of Mr Eduardo Gmez Sgala and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the legal procedure for land recovery was followed since they failed to demonstrate their ownership of the land; thus, this does not constitute expropriation.
.In the case of Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia, according to these institutions, the land that he occupied has been recovered. He demonstrated his ownership of part of that land, of which he is still in possession, and the remainder, the ownership of which he was unable to demonstrate, has been recovered. Thus, he still owns the portion of the land of which he demonstrated his ownership.
.With respect to the other two cases, concerning Mr Egildo Lujn and Mr Vicente Brito, INTI has reported that its archives contain no information on any recoveries or expropriations under their names.
.The Government maintains that it has been demonstrated that the application of the Land and Agrarian Development Act and the implementation of procedures by the state agencies in the matter did not give rise to acts of anti-union discrimination or harassment, and that the State did not act on a discretionary basis in the application of its land policy; procedures and mechanisms for the recovery and expropriation of land are determined by national law and implemented by the competent bodies.
.Therefore, since land and agrarian development policies are not matters for examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association, the Government requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of these cases since they do not entail violations of freedom of association, let alone acts of anti-union persecution.
.With regard to recommendation (d) (bipartite and tripartite social dialogue), the Government confirms that, as it has informed the Committee on Freedom of Association and other ILO supervisory bodies on numerous occasions, the country has broad and inclusive participatory dialogue, which is ongoing, and consultation of the people is a daily occurrence during the legislative drafting process. The Government has repeatedly called on FEDECAMARAS to participate in the national dialogue on various issues, but its invitations have been ignored. However, other employers' organizations in various sectors have responded to this call for dialogue on, among other things, economic and labour-related matters.
.The Government notes with satisfaction the statement contained in paragraph  of the report of the high-level tripartite mission, whereby the mission took into consideration the inclusive dialogue highlighted by the Government and taking place in the country within the framework of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Government also reaffirms that the application of, and compliance with, the ILO Conventions on freedom of association, collective bargaining and social dialogue in the country are not in question.
.The Government reports that it is still holding consultations with the trade unions, chambers and professional associations, land committees, rural committees, municipal councils and other peoples' organizations concerning the preparation and content of the plan of action, which provides for the establishment of forums for dialogue, all in accordance with the constitutional and legal framework of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. However, the Government stresses, as it indicated to the FEDECAMARAS president, that the issues that the various organizations have proposed for discussion are quite different from those recommended by the ILO mission, which were not of interest or were based on false information that did not warrant the establishment of a round table to discuss them. The Government states that it is important for the Committee to ask the complainant organization whether it is really willing to establish a round table to discuss, for example, the attack on and abduction of the employers' leader Ms Albis Muoz, an issue that, to date, none of the organizations consulted, not even the FEDECAMARAS members, have shown any interest in. As stated above, the Government maintains that it will inform the ILO once the consultations with the various organizations concerned are concluded. Despite these consultations, as it replied in its communication of  March  during the corresponding session of the ILO Governing Body, the Government reaffirms the following with respect to the recommendations contained in the mission report:(a) Concerning a dialogue round table that will address  other existing problems that may arise in the future in this area' (recovery of estates), the Government informed that this proposal is not viable to the extent that, first, it is not possible to establish a dialogue round table to address issues that could possibly arise in an uncertain future, and second, article  of the Law on Land and Agrarian Development establishes a clear procedure which cannot be negotiated between two parties.(b) A tripartite dialogue round table cannot be mandated to conduct consultations on laws. It could at most be one of the bodies consulted. The Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is very clear about the competencies related to the consultation, the adoption or the exemption of laws.(c) Discussions on laws and bills are within the competence of the National Assembly. Likewise, the socio-economic policy of the country lies within under the jurisdiction of the National Executive power, in coordination with the other authorities of the State, this without limiting mechanisms for dialogue and consultation that already exist in the country and are put in place with the various sectors concerned. Consultations may be held, among other bodies, under a tripartite round table which cannot be erected as a supra-constitutional body.(d) There is no national law that violates the rights contained in the ILO Conventions mentioned as it would be unconstitutional. In this respect, there is no legal action against any law of the country for which the Constitutional Courts have granted remedy. It is unclear to what the ILO tripartite mission refers when it indicates as an objective for the tripartite dialogue round table to achieve  compliance of national legislation with ratified Conventions'  The Government recommends",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
136,"that the Committee on Freedom of Association and the other supervisory bodies analyse articles  to  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which is the source of all the labour laws of the country, in order to determine whether some of the provisions are contrary to ratified Conventions.
.The Government adds that the judicial or administrative procedures in force must be concluded and carried out by the competent institutions in accordance with the national legislation.
.In conclusion, the Government states that, in order for the organizations consulted to develop a real plan for dialogue, the Committee must take a decision on these matters since, to date, there has been no reply to the Government s comments on the mission report and, specifically, on the recommendations that clearly contravene the legal framework and the national Constitution.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government refers to the recommendations contained in the report of the high-level tripartite mission conducted in the country in January  and reiterates that the implementation of many of those measures is not viable. The Government points out that the issues that were specifically addressed during  per cent of the activity time during the visit of the tripartite mission in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela have been omitted from the mission report.
.In the mission report, the activities of the tripartite mission during its visit to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela are found to be unfinished and therefore not useful. Accordingly, it is necessary for the Committee on Freedom of Association to urgently decide upon the relevance or connection of the denounced facts with Conventions Nos  or  contained in Case No. , such as:' The supposed aggression towards the citizen Albis Muoz, leader of the civil association FEDECAMARAS, an IOE affiliate; notwithstanding the fact that during the visit of the mission it was demonstrated and not refuted that it had been a fortuitous act perpetrated by a group of offenders with a lengthy police record in the early morning hours, while exiting a restaurant, and was in no way related to trade union activity.' The alleged land expropriation from the leaders of the civil association FEDECAMARAS, an IOE affiliate; notwithstanding the fact that during the visit of the mission it was demonstrated and not refuted that it was a policy for the recovery of illegally occupied agricultural land and that the reported cases represented only . per cent of the total reclaimed land, it was therefore not a case of trade union reprisal, and at no point in time was the legality of the occupation of this land proven before any competent body by the interested parties.' The alleged harassment of employers, illustrated by the expropriation of the SIDETUR and Owens Illinois companies; notwithstanding the fact that during the visit of the mission it was demonstrated and not refuted that the said cases concerned actions contemplated under the Venezuelan legal system, the owners of the enterprises had resorted to establishing legal mechanisms guaranteeing their right to defence, and it was not a trade union case.' The alleged exclusion of the civil association FEDECAMARAS from the process of developing the Basic Act on Labour and Workers (LOTTT); notwithstanding the fact that during the visit of the mission it was demonstrated and not refuted that the National Assembly held consultations on the legal text during  years, consultations in which FEDECAMARAS participated directly or indirectly, through the presentation of documents.
.The Government adds that the text of the report is dedicated primarily to the tripartite mechanisms implemented in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, a topic that was not discussed during the meetings held with bodies of the Venezuelan State; and the conclusions were made at the last moment and outside of the report. The Government therefore also asks the Committee on Freedom of Association to reach a decision on the viability of the implementation of several recommendations contained in the report of the ILO high-level tripartite mission, some of the latter being illegal or unconstitutional. More specifically, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not obtained a reply with respect to the following recommendations:' With regard to the fact that the dialogue round table will address  other existing problems that may arise in the future in this area' (recovery of estates), the proposal is not viable since addressing a topic that could possibly arise in an uncertain future cannot be subordinated to the establishment of a dialogue round table. Furthermore, section  of the Land and Agrarian Development Act clearly provides the legal procedures for the recovery of land; the latter could not be altered through bipartite negotiation. Moreover, the consultations held with trade union organizations of rural workers, as recommended in the conclusions of the mission report, demonstrated a total lack of interest in participating in a round table on a past topic considered as closed, under which all legal guarantees were already granted to the persons concerned.' The Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is very clear regarding the competences for consultation, adoption or abrogation of laws. It is not up to a tripartite round table to hold consultations on legislation, as it is not the competent body, let alone to take a decision concerning any legislative text, as these actions would be unconstitutional in the country.' The discussion of laws and bills falls within the competences of the National Assembly. In addition, the socio-economic policy of the country falls within the competences of the executive branch, in coordination with the other branches of the Venezuelan State, without however limiting the consultation and dialogue mechanisms existing in the country and implemented with the various sectors involved. Consequently, a tripartite or bipartite round table cannot be a supra-constitutional body in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.' There is no national law violating the rights contained in the Conventions being reviewed by the Committee on Freedom of Association, as such a law would be unconstitutional. The Government is not aware of any legal action in which a constitutional court of the Republic would have declared the unconstitutionality of a national law based on those grounds. It is therefore difficult to know what is being referred to in the report of the tripartite mission where it is specified that the objective of the tripartite round table would consist of  bringing domestic legislation into conformity with the Conventions' ' The Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela provides for a referendum repealing legislation when the population believes that a particular law is contrary to the public interest. It is a fact that the complainants have not even tried to activate this legal mechanism against a law that they deem detrimental to the national interest.' In the context of the consultation with the Bolivarian Socialist Workers' Confederation of Venezuela (CBST), a majority trade union and the most representative of Venezuelan workers, an opinion was issued that was contrary to the establishment of the committees recommended in the mission report. The CBST refuses to participate at the round table with FEDECAMARAS, as the latter chose, as part of previous round tables, to participate in illegal actions, such as committing a coup, plotting an oil sabotage, using paid assassins against campesino leaders and taking part in the economic sabotage of the population. The CBST reiterates that, only if the civil association FEDECAMARAS publicly recognizes the illegal actions committed in the past and condemns present actions by followers of this organization, it will then be possible to establish a dialogue with it. Meanwhile, the CBST prefers to keep the large ongoing national dialogue open, from which FEDECAMARAS has excluded itself.
.The Government once again reiterates the recommendation and request made to the Committee on Freedom of Association and other ILO supervisory bodies with respect to the study of the content of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the LOTTT, from which the labour laws are derived, in order to ascertain whether the legislation is in compliance with ratified Conventions.
.In order for the organizations and the Government to formulate a real plan whose execution is possible, it is necessary for the Committee to decide on these issues, because until now the Government has not obtained a reply to the considerations made regarding the recommendations contained in the mission report that openly violate the legal corpus and the Constitution.
.Finally, the Government indicates that the President of FEDECAMARAS has recently shown that he saw as positive the initiative and decision taken by the President of the Republic to reconvene all sectors in a national dialogue in order to make proposals. The first meeting was held in February  at the headquarters of FEDECAMARAS between the President and the representatives of this organization and representatives of the Presidential Commission of Economic Affairs.
.The President of FEDECAMARAS expressed that the meeting had been very productive and considered that the President of the industrial organization FEDEINDUSTRIA, Miguel Prez Adad, was the right person to coordinate these meetings and discussions with various sectors of the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
137,"country. In addition, the representative of FEDECAMARAS expressed his conviction that a new opportunity would arise to search for a new constructive and cooperative stage with the national Government that will result in substantial agreements. In this regard, on  February , FEDECAMARAS convened all private and public enterprises, workers, entrepreneurs and social organizations, through a press release, to participate in this important national debate.
.The Government attaches press clippings in which the President of FEDECAMARAS dissociates himself from past mistakes () and indicates that the past President misunderstood his role; FEDECAMARAS is an institution that may influence political power but may not exercise it.
.In its communications dated  and  March , the Government sent observations and information from the Prosecutors' Office on the new allegations of the complainants. The Government denies attacks on business and states that there are no criminal proceedings against the two employer leaders mentioned by the complainants and reports the prosecution of eight enterprise managers for offences of an economic nature. The Government also reports that, in relation to the eight enterprise managers, the judicial authority has taken measures for their preventive detention or alternative precautionary measures.
.Firstly, the Committee would like to recall that for years it has considered the present case (No. ) extremely serious and urgent and that the Governing Body decided to request the Director-General to send a high-level tripartite mission to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in order to look into all the issues that were still pending with regard to Case No.  and all matters relating to technical cooperation. This high-level tripartite mission was composed of the Chairperson, Employer Vice-Chairperson and Worker Vice-Chairperson of the Governing Body and was conducted from  to  January . The Committee on Freedom of Association took the report on this mission fully into account during its previous examination of the case (June ) and, in formulating its conclusions, noted that  [t]he mission considers that it is necessary for the Government to devise a plan of action that includes stages and specific time frames' for the pending issues. With regard to technical cooperation, the mission reminded the Government that it could avail itself of the technical assistance of the International Labour Office, not only in matters concerning social dialogue and structured bodies, but also in the adoption of criteria and procedures to measure the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The mission noted that the Government had made a general statement to the effect that it did not rule out the possibility of availing itself of technical cooperation programmes, if necessary. The mission considered that the Government needed to convey its willingness to do so in more specific terms.
.The Committee notes with regret that the Government has not yet developed a plan of action that sets stages and specific time frames relating to the pending issues (the Government states, in its first response, that the consultations on tripartite mechanisms for social dialogue are ongoing and, in its second response, it adds that the CBST is opposed to tripartite committees), nor has it conveyed in more specific terms its willingness to avail itself of the technical assistance of the International Labour Office. The Committee regrets that the Government has instead elected once again to disparage the complainant organization, FEDECAMARAS, recalling the past (although the Government itself indicates that the President of FEDECAMARAS acknowledged his organization s past mistakes) and requesting closure of the examination of various allegations, while delaying the adoption of the measures requested and asking for a decision to be reached on the compliance of the Constitution and the LOTTT with the ratified Conventions. The Committee requests the Government to be more constructive and to duly recognize that the present case concerns serious acts of physical violence and threats against employers' organizations and leaders and against enterprises, expropriation of land belonging to union leaders and an absence of dialogue with the employers' association, FEDECAMARAS, whose full enjoyment of the rights arising from Conventions Nos  and  the Government is obliged to ensure. In this regard, the request that judgments be rendered without undue delay is fully justified.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements concerning the pending allegations of various forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc. The Committee notes with regret that, in reply to its request that the Government take strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals, the Government merely states that it is the actions of FEDECAMARAS that have caused the hatred of the Venezuelan people, recalling events that date from '  and demanding a public apology from FEDECAMARAS as a prerequisite for a climate of trust. The Committee observes with concern that the new allegations by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS have resulted in an escalation of the authorities' verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS and in the harassment of employers' leaders.
.The Committee would like to emphasize that the Government is responsible for ensuring the safety of employers' organizations and their leaders and that, as is clear from the evidence provided to the high-level tripartite mission, the state authorities are the source of many of the threats and much of the stigmatization targeting employers' organizations and their leaders, which have been a repeated occurrence in recent years. The Committee notes with regret that the Government has failed to provide information on the strong measures that it had been requested to take in order to avoid such actions. Under these circumstances, the Committee is bound to express its regret and concern at the alleged events and reiterate the conclusions and recommendations made during its previous examination of the case.
.In that regard, the Committee once again expresses its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS as an institution, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, which are described in detail in the mission report, and include threats of imprisonment, the placement of posters inciting hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the occupation of shops, incitement to vandalism and looting, etc. The Committee recalls that for the contribution of trade unions and employers' organizations to be properly useful and credible, they must be able to carry out their activities in a climate of freedom and security. This implies that, in so far as they may consider that they do not have the basic freedom to fulfil their mission directly, trade unions and employers' organizations would be justified in demanding that these freedoms and the right to exercise them be recognized and that these demands be considered as coming within the scope of legitimate trade union activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], and that a climate of violence, in which attacks are made against trade union premises and property, constitutes serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights; such situations call for severe measures to be taken by the authorities, and in particular the arraignment of those presumed to be responsible before an independent judicial authority [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee draws the Government s attention to the importance of taking strong measures to stop such threats and prevent statements of incitement to hatred and the looting of property, all of which are harmful to individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; in the specific case of FEDECAMARAS, this refers to its leaders, member organizations and affiliated companies. The Committee once again draws the Government s attention to, and requests it to ensure compliance with, the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate free from violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No.  [see nd Report, para. ].
.Regarding the alleged abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS officials Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained bullet wounds), the Committee observes that the Government reiterates its previous statements (to the effect that the perpetrators are in custody, that this is an instance of common crime having nothing to do with the victims' status as employers' leaders, and that, for this reason, the examination of this case should not be pursued) and that the complainant organizations have disputed the Government s position. The Committee had",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
138,"expressed the firm hope that the criminal proceedings would be concluded without further delay and once again notes with regret that the proceedings concerning the abduction and mistreatment of the four employers' leaders have not yet been completed. The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendations.
.As regards the  bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters, in relation to which the Government has reported the death of the perpetrator, the Committee also observes that FEDECAMARAS indicated to the high-level tripartite mission that: () the person who planted the bomb (a police inspector, Mr Hctor Serrano) died as a result of the explosion; () on  February , a complaint was filed with the Public Prosecutor s Office; () on  August , the Public Prosecutor s Office issued a ruling ordering the case to be closed for lack of sufficient evidence to establish a guilty party, which was appealed by FEDECAMARAS; () on  May , the Forensic, Penal and Criminal Investigations Unit (CICPC) announced the detention of a public official, police officer, Mr Crisstomo Montoya, for an act of terrorism in planting the explosive device (it is reported that he has been released) and that Ms Ivonne Mrquez was also implicated;() the th Court of First Instance scheduled the public hearing of the oral trial for  November , which was deferred to  October ; and () to date no one has been found guilty of the attack. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.
.Generally speaking, with regard to the allegations of physical and verbal violence against employers' leaders and their organizations, the Committee once more stresses that the absence of judgments against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], and that justice delayed is justice denied [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and of compensating FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned for the damage caused by those illegal acts [see nd Report, para. ].
.As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee previously requested that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sgala, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee referred to the Governing Body s decision of March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises (including the new information communicated to the mission) and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee urged the Government to implement this request and to report thereon. Furthermore, the Committee, as did the mission, noted with concern the information provided about new acts of recovery, occupation and expropriation of the property of an employers' leader of FEDECAMARAS (Mr Vicente Brito). Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasized  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' 
.The Committee notes the Government s statement, with regard to the alleged seizure of farms belonging to employers' leaders Mr Eduardo Gmez Sgala and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, that the Ministry of Agriculture and Land and INTI have reported that, in the case of those leaders, the legal procedure for land recovery was followed since they failed to demonstrate their ownership of the land and that this did not therefore constitute expropriation; and that, in the case of Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia, the land that he occupied has been recovered. He demonstrated his ownership of part of that land, of which he is still in possession, and the remainder, the ownership of which he was unable to demonstrate, has been recovered. In the other two cases, concerning Mr Egildo Lujn and Mr Vicente Brito, INTI has reported that its archives contain no information on any recoveries or expropriations under their names. The Committee notes the Government s statement that it has been demonstrated that the application of the Land and Agrarian Development Act and the implementation of procedures by the state agencies in the matter did not give rise to acts of anti-union discrimination or harassment and that the application of land policy was not based on discretionary action by the State; the procedures and mechanisms for the recovery and expropriation of land are determined by national law and implemented by the competent bodies. The Committee notes that the Government considers that a country s land and agrarian development policies are not matters for examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association and that it requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of these cases since they do not entail violations of freedom of association, let alone acts of anti-union persecution.
.The Committee observed during previous examinations of the case that the complainant organizations maintained that the expropriations and recoveries were linked to the status of the employers' leaders in question and that they were discriminatory.
.The Committee notes with regret that, with regard to the allegations that land belonging to employers' leaders was expropriated, the Government gives legal reasons for not allowing FEDECAMARAS to participate in a round table on land recovery owing to a procedure established in the Land and Agrarian Development Act. In particular, the Committee notes the Government s statement, concerning a dialogue round table that will address  other existing problems that may arise in the future in this area' (recovery of estates), that this proposal is not viable since it is not possible to establish a dialogue round table to address issues that could possibly arise in an uncertain future and that section  of the Land and Agrarian Development Act establishes a clear procedure which cannot be negotiated between two parties. The Government indicates that the trade union organizations of rural workers (whose names are not specified) showed a total lack of interest in participating in a round table and adds that it is not up to a tripartite round table to hold consultations on legislation. The Committee recalls that its examination of cases of expropriation or recovery of land belonging to employers' leaders has been conducted solely from the point of view of potential discrimination owing to their status as leaders. The Committee stresses that the purpose of the round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS would be for the two parties to examine and evaluate the functioning of the existing system and the usefulness of potential legislative amendments and to examine the application of procedures in respect of these leaders. The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendations, including those concerning fair compensation for the current or former leaders of FEDECAMERAS in question.
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee noted with regret from the report of the high-level tripartite mission that the Tripartite Commission on minimum wages, which had existed under the previous labour legislation, had been abolished under the new legislation (the Basic Act on Labour and Workers (LOTTT)). It also took note of the allegations made by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS, in which they stated that the Government, again ignoring the Committee s recommendations, had continued to issue regulations with a significant impact on both private Venezuelan companies and their workers without proper tripartite consultation and social dialogue, in particular without including FEDECAMARAS as the most representative employers' organization in the country. The Committee further noted that there had been no consultation on People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security Decision No.  of  April , which regulates the National Register of Workers' Organizations but also applies to employers' organizations; the partial regulation on working time relating to the Decree with the rank, power and force of the Basic Act on Labour and Workers, published on  April ; and the previous failure to consult FEDECAMARAS with regard to the aforementioned Basic Act and many other pieces of legislation.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements reiterating that the country has broad and inclusive participatory dialogue during the drafting of legislation and that consultation of the people is a daily occurrence. The Committee also notes the Government s statement that FEDECAMARAS has repeatedly been called on to participate in the national dialogue",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
139,"on various issues but has ignored those invitations; however, other employers' organizations in various sectors have responded to the call for dialogue on, among other things, economic and labour-related matters. The Committee observes that FEDECAMARAS has been denying for years that it has refused to participate in the dialogue. The Committee notes that the Government provides a new example of its call for dialogue (through a first meeting that was held in February  between the representatives of FEDECAMARAS and representatives of the Presidential Commission of Economic Affairs). The Committee expresses its appreciation for this initiative and encourages the Government to promote social dialogue. The Committee notes the Government s statements concerning the consultations held with FEDECAMARAS regarding the LOTTT and wishes nonetheless to recall that, while consultations were held on preliminary draft bills between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, the  final version of the draft bill was not a subject of consultations between FEDECAMARA and the executive branch.
.The Government states that it is still holding consultations with the trade unions, chambers and professional associations, land committees, rural committees, municipal councils and other peoples' organizations concerning the preparation and content of the plan of action for the establishment of forums for dialogue, all in accordance with the constitutional and legal framework of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. However, according to the Government, the issues that the various organizations have proposed for discussion are quite different from those recommended by the ILO mission; it will inform the ILO once the consultations with the various organizations concerned are concluded. The Committee notes the Government s reiteration that discussions on laws and bills are within the competence of the National Assembly. Likewise, the socio-economic policy of the country lies within the jurisdiction of the National Executive, in coordination with the other authorities of the State, this without limiting the existing mechanisms for dialogue and consultation with the various sectors concerned. Consultations may be held under, among other bodies, a tripartite round table which cannot, however, be erected as a supra-constitutional body. The Constitution is very clear about the competencies related to consultations on the adoption and repeal of laws, and a  ripartite dialogue round table cannot be mandated to conduct consultations on laws. It could at most be one of the bodies consulted. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no national law that would violate the rights contained in ILO Conventions Nos  and  since this would be unconstitutional. To the Government s knowledge, there is no legal action against any law of the country for which the Constitutional Courts would have granted remedy and it is unclear to what the ILO tripartite mission refers when it indicates as an objective for the tripartite dialogue round table to achieve  compliance of national legislation with ratified Conventions'  In order for the organizations consulted to develop a real plan for dialogue, the Committee must take a decision on these matters since, to date, there has been no reply to the Government s comments on the mission report and, specifically, on the recommendations that, according to the Government, clearly contravene the legal framework and the national Constitution.
.The Committee would like to recall that, during previous examinations of the case, it has drawn attention to various legal provisions to which the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has objected and which had not been submitted to tripartite consultation. The provisions in question should be submitted to such consultation and brought into conformity with Conventions Nos  and  [see th Report, Case No. , paras  and ].
.The Committee wishes to reproduce again some of the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission [see the mission report and nd Report of the Committee, paras ' ]:The mission notes that FEDECAMARAS continues to state that there are serious deficiencies in terms of social dialogue and that it is not consulted except on rare occasions and in relation to minimum wage fixing ' . The mission also notes that FEDECAMARAS and the Government concur that some associations that are members of FEDECAMARAS are consulted on occasion.' the mission recalls the importance of creating the conditions necessary for initiating tripartite social dialogue with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations on matters relating to industrial relations, which requires a constructive spirit, good faith, mutual respect and respect for the freedom of association and independence of the parties, in-depth discussions over a reasonable period, and efforts to find, as far as possible, shared solutions that will, to a certain extent, attenuate the polarization afflicting Venezuelan society. The mission highlights that the inclusive dialogue recommended by the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is fully compatible with the existence of tripartite social dialogue bodies and that any negative experience of tripartism in the past should not compromise the application of ILO Conventions concerning freedom of association, collective bargaining and social dialogue, or undermine the contribution made by tripartism in all ILO member States.In keeping with the conclusions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, the mission reminded the Government that it can avail itself of the technical assistance of the International Labour Office, not only in matters concerning social dialogue and structured bodies, but also in the adoption of criteria and procedures to measure the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The mission noted that the Government made a general statement to the effect that it does not rule out the possibility of availing itself of technical cooperation programmes, if necessary. The mission considers that the Government needs to convey its willingness to do so in more specific terms. In keeping with the concern expressed above, the mission strongly invites the Government to consider the following recommendations.Technical cooperationRecalling, in keeping with the views expressed by the Committee on Freedom of Association, the need for and the importance of establishing structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue in the country and noting that no tangible progress has been made in that regard, the mission considers it essential for immediate action to be taken to build a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The mission considers that it is necessary for the Government to devise a plan of action that includes stages and specific time frames for its implementation, and which provides for:() the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises (including the new information communicated to the mission) and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future;() the establishment of a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO, that is presided over by an independent chairperson who has the trust of all the sectors, that duly respects the representativeness of employers' and workers' organizations in its composition, that meets periodically to deal with all matters relating to industrial relations decided upon by the parties, and that includes the holding of consultations on new legislation to be adopted concerning labour, social or economic matters (including within the framework of the Enabling Act) among its main objectives. The criteria used to determine the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations must be based on objective procedures that fully respect the principles set out by the ILO. Therefore, the mission believes that it is important for the Government to be able to avail itself of the technical assistance of the ILO to that end;() the discussion of laws, bills, other regulations and socio-economic policy at the tripartite dialogue round table, with a view to bringing domestic legislation into conformity with the Conventions concerning freedom of association and collective bargaining ' ;() the identification of the causes of the problems related to administrative and judicial proceedings that affect workers' and employers' organizations and their representatives, with a view to finding solutions that will settle all matters pending in Case No. .
.The Committee notes with concern that, in its two communications, the Government reiterates the information that it had previously communicated concerning the invitation to all the stakeholders in the country to take part in a national conference on peace and in round tables on economic matters, in which FEDECAMARAS would participate, without explaining the progress made on the new requested measures with regard to genuine social dialogue.
.The Committee recalls that, at its March  meeting, taking note of the report of the high-level tripartite mission, the Governing Body urged the Government to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners; and requested the Director-General to provide the required technical assistance to that end.
.The Committee reiterates the conclusions and recommendations that it made during the previous examination of the case and urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to social dialogue and bipartite and tripartite",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
140,"round tables as requested by the high-level tripartite mission.
.The Committee notes with great concern that there has not been rapid compliance with the decisions of the Governing Body and that the Government has not yet provided any plan of action, in consultation with the social partners, that establishes stages and specific time frames for its implementation, with the recommended technical assistance from the ILO.
.The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission also refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately implement tripartite consultations and indicates that, although some trade union organizations may not wish to take part in tripartite round tables, the Government has a duty to promote tripartite consultations and social dialogue without excluding representative organizations, such as FEDECAMARAS.
.The Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, which were endorsed by the Governing Body, and requests it to report thereon. The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges as well the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard.
.The Committee again requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose any problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.
.The Committee notes that, in their communication of  November , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS state that the Government is still ignoring the recommendations made by the high-level tripartite mission. They also report new violations of Conventions Nos  and , particularly: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, president of CONINDUSTRIA, for  hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, president of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level state officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee notes these allegations with concern and requests the Government to send complete observations on the matter.
.The Committee notes with concern the allegation contained in the recent joint communication from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS, that  entrepreneurs from various sectors, including the Chairperson of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals and the Chairperson of the National Association of Supermarkets and Self-Services, Mr Luis Rodriquez, were detained without due process and in violation of the right of defence, as well as other allegations. The Committee notes the Government s communications of  and  March  denying attacks on business and stating that there are no criminal proceedings against the two employer leaders mentioned by the complainants, reporting the prosecution of eight enterprise managers for offences of an economic nature, and reporting also that, as regards the eight enterprise managers, the judicial authority has taken measures for their preventive detention or alternative precautionary measures. The Committee requests the Government to complete its response and intends to review the issues raised therein in a detailed manner at its next meeting in May .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee draws the Government s attention to the importance of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.(b) The Committee notes with regret that the criminal proceedings relating to the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February  and the abduction and mistreatment in  of the leaders of that organization, Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds) have not yet been completed (FEDECAMARAS appealed against the ruling ordering the closure of the case concerning the bomb attack on its headquarters), again expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded without further delay, and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the issues raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee requests that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  and regrets that the Government stated in its last communication that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable. The Committee urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it has not yet concluded the process of consultation with different sectors and organizations and requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Noting that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meeting held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February , and to immediately implement tripartite consultations.(e) Finally, the Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee further requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose any problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee notes with concern the new allegations by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS of  November  concerning: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, president of CONINDUSTRIA, for  hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, president of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level state officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
141,"laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee requests the Government to send complete observations on these allegations.(g) The Committee notes with concern the new allegations from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS and takes note of the recent Government observations on some of the allegations. The Committee requests the Government to complete its response and intends to review the issues raised therein in a detailed manner at its next meeting in May .(h) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers and Associations of Commerce and Production (FEDECAMARAS) subsequently sent allegations and additional information in a joint communication dated  August .
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  October ,  February and  May .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case at its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) Regarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter having been wounded by three bullets, the Committee ' which had taken note that two of the suspects had been arrested ' deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee notes the Government s statements on developments in the proceedings and expresses the hope that the perpetrators of the crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in a manner commensurate with the seriousness of the offences, so that such incidents are not repeated, and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. At the same time, the Committee notes that the Government s observations are not conducive to dissipating the concern it had expressed in its previous examination of the case (according to the IOE, the employers' leader Albis Muoz asserted that neither of the suspects arrested by the Government (Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression).(b) Regarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state once again that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations did not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. The Committee requests the Government to send it the decisions handed down by the authorities (Office of the Public Prosecutor, the judicial authority) in this case.(c) Regarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , concerning which the Government had stated that the persons charged (Juan Chrisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Ms Ivonne Giaconda Marquez Burgos) confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, the Committee notes the information sent by the Government on these developments in the criminal proceedings. The Committee stresses the importance that the guilty parties be punished in a manner commensurate with the seriousness of the crimes committed and that the employers' organization be compensated for the losses and damages sustained as a result of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(d) Observing the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS and its officials, the Committee once again drew the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(e) Regarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to the employers' leader Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s reply to the effect that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that the employers' leader Eduardo Gomez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee looks forward to receiving the information that the Government says it will send and again calls on the Government to return the farm without delay to the employers' leader and to compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the authorities' seizure of his farm.(f) Regarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders Egildo Lujn, Vicente Brito, Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considered that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination and once again requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay, to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep the Committee informed of developments. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the payment of compensation has been decided.(g) Regarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue and of consultations with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without tripartite consultation of numerous presidential legislative decrees and laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. Observing that serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist and have even grown, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government, with the assistance of the ILO, to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country to examine every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the ILO principles, with a tripartite composition that duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests the Government once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Act on Labour;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subjected to genuine, in depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various branches of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws that affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employers' interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has once again ignored these recommendations despite the fact that the Committee has been insisting on them for years.(h) The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the High-level Tripartite Mission approved in March , which the Government had agreed could look into the issues that were still pending with regard to Case No. , has twice been postponed. The Committee is",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
142,"strongly of the view that the mission should take place in the near future and requests the Office to contact the Government to that effect. The Committee considers that the mission should be able to make a contribution to resolving the problems raised.(i) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of the matters dealt with in this case.
.In their communication dated  August , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS indicated that they were presenting additional information, thereby expanding Complaint No. , which was before the Committee on Freedom of Association, against the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, given the existence of new facts constituting violations of both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), both ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The IOE and FEDECAMARAS request once again that the case be granted priority treatment, given the serious and continued breaches by that Government of the recommendations of the Committee with regard to tripartite dialogue and the freedom of association, and that the Committee continuously monitor the situation with a view to adopting a decision that will compel the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela once again to comply strictly with the international commitments it has undertaken within the ILO.
.The complainant organizations emphasize, first, that the Committee has been consistent in its reports, urging the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to comply with its recommendations, particularly with regard to social dialogue, and requesting that bipartite or tripartite consultations be held in the various sectors, as well as to maintain a social dialogue with the inclusion of FEDECAMARAS in particular, as the most representative employers' organization of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, especially with regard to the development of economic and social policy and bills or other regulations that may affect the activities of employers and their organizations, prior to their adoption by the Executive Power and by the legislature of that country. However, and again ignoring the recommendations of the Committee, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has continued to adopt and dictate regulations of great impact on both private Venezuelan companies and their workers, as well as on Venezuelan consumers, without proper tripartite consultation and social dialogue involving FEDECAMARAS. This practice affects the freedom of association and the right to organize and constitutes a permanent and continuous violation of Conventions Nos  and  of the ILO. On several occasions, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has used as an argument in its defence in this complaint that FEDECAMARAS has allegedly opted out of the dialogue and has allegedly adopted a confrontational attitude towards the Government. But the fact is that the Venezuelan Government has not demonstrated to the ILO that it has held, now or in the past, the consultations in question with the most representative employers' organization in the country (FEDECAMARAS), whose status is incontrovertible in the ILO, on economic policy decisions or regulations that impact business operations and the labour movement, as required by Convention No.  of the ILO, nor has it given proof of the alleged self exclusion on the part of FEDECAMARAS. As examples of calls for dialogue by FEDECAMARAS:' Press release of FEDECAMARAS on  April : http://fedecamaras.org.ve/notas-de-prensa/comunicado-fedecamaras-;' FEDECAMARAS: It is necessary to convene a national dialogue,  February , interview on Venvision: http://fedecamaras.org.ve/notas-de-prensa/fedecamaras-es-necesario-convocar-a-un-dialogo-national;' FEDECAMARAS promotes dialogue with the Government from the regions: http://fedecamaras.org.ve/notas-de-prensa/fedecamaras-impulsa-dialogo-con-el-gobierno-desde-las-regiones;' Notice: La Nacin newspaper ' press release by FEDECAMARAS: http://fedecamaras.org.ve/notas-de-prensa/press-release-FEDECAMARAS;' FEDECAMARAS welcomes the call for dialogue from the national Government,  January : http://fedecamaras.org.ve/notas-de-prensa/fedecamaras-celebra-el-llamado-al-dialogo-del-gobiernonacional;' Video Globovisin,  October : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONe dWpw;' FEDECAMARAS: press conference before the election process of  October : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v-ONe dWpw.
.Such willingness to enter into dialogue on the part of FEDECAMARAS was even recognized by President Hugo Chavez (now deceased) in his speech-proclamation to the National Electoral Council held on  October , after being re-elected President of the Republic in the election of  October (see the speech in the video, starting from minute : http://albaciudad.org/wp/index.php///en-video-discurso-de-chavez-tras-ser-proclamado-para-el-periodo---este-debe-ser-de-mejores-logros-en-elcamino-hacia-el-socialismo/).
.A further manifestation of FEDECAMARAS s openness and frank willingness and interest in generating a constructive dialogue among Venezuelan businessmen can be seen in its decision to include in the employers' delegation attending the nd Session of the ILO International Labour Conference in Geneva last June a representative of another employers' organization (not representative), in an advisory capacity, without implying the recognition of the greater or similar representativeness of that organization compared to FEDECAMARAS under the standards recognized by the ILO, in the form of the proposed inclusion of Mr Alfredo Cabrera, representing the National Confederation of Farmers and Ranchers of Venezuela (CONFAGAN), which was officially communicated to the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security in a communication dated  May .
.Although the new President of the Republic, Nicols Maduro, elected in the elections of  April , has promoted the holding of a few technical round tables with businessmen to address specific issues, that has not yet materialized with respect to FEDECAMARAS which is the most representative employers' organization in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.Indeed, in the month of April , the National Executive again adopted measures with significant impact on the operation of enterprises and trade unions without any previous consultation on the matter with FEDECAMARAS, the most representative employers' organization in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The measures in question are a resolution of the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security and a presidential decree, that, with respect to the registration of trade unions and working hours, further develop the provisions of the decree with the rank, power and force of the Organic Act on Labour and Workers (that was issued on the basis of an Enabling Act by the President of the Republic), which is the fundamental law specifically governing labour relations and was issued on  May  and published in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela Special Issue No.  of the same date (that Organic Act is hereinafter referred to simply as  LOTTT' , with the entry into force of certain provisions on  May , through a vacatio legis, that is, the completion of a one-year period after the entry into force of the law.
.According to the provisions of article  of the LOTTT, trade unions, depending on their territorial scope, be it local, state, regional or national, must apply for registration and documentation from a National Register of Workers' and Employers' Organizations, that has been established under this Act. Articles ,  and  of the Organic Act further provide that the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security shall establish branches of the Register in each state of the country, so that those concerned can proceed with the registration of trade unions and their activities.
.Based on those provisions of the LOTTT, the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security issued on  April  Resolution No. , which was published in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela No.  of  April , regulating the establishment and operation of the National Register of Workers' and Employers' Organizations, including both workers' organizations and those of employers.
.Among the tasks of the National Register listed in article  of the LOTTT are:(a) the registration of trade unions and employers' organizations; the review and registration of amendments to their statutes; the annual submission of accounts covering the management of union funds; the submission and review by the Register of the list of members that the union sends in annually; the registration of changes in officers resulting from union elections or restructuring; the dissolution of a union taken over by another or a merger to create a new union;(b) closing the registration of a trade union either through dissolution agreed by its members in accordance with its statutes, or by decision of the Labour Court.
.Articles  and following articles of the Organic Act set forth the minimum requirements in terms of membership and conditions that must be contained in the founding charters and statutes of labour organizations; article  provides the grounds for refusing to register a trade union if it fails to meet the requirements specified; and article  stipulates the actions to be reported to the Register, facts that were part of the second extension of Complaint No.  made in  as a result of the adoption without consultation of the aforementioned act, at which time express mention was made of the issue of the National Register of Workers' and Employers' Organizations.
.Further developing these provisions, article  of the ministerial resolution stresses and makes clear that employers' organizations, trade unions and central federations or confederations must register with the Register after presenting the documents required and that these organizations will be handled at the headquarters of the Register established by the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security in",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
143,"the city of Caracas (see the text of the resolution: http://www.tsj.gov.ve/gaceta/abril//-.pdf # page=).
.Based on the above, one can see that there is a high degree of interference and control on the part of the Executive Power and the administrative authority in labour matters, which interferes with the normal functioning of trade unions. The consequence is that, if they have been denied registration or recognition by the Register for whatever reason, the unions concerned cannot undertake any act with legal effect, which limits absolutely the freedom of association under ILO Convention No. .
.In that connection, one of the major impacts of this regulation is the high level of discretion in determining the admissibility of a registration application on the part of the official making the assessment of the documents; his refusal disqualifies that organization from presenting itself as a legitimate interlocutor for the employer or the workers, as appropriate. Indeed, under this resolution, the public authorities only recognize as legitimate organizations those that are registered in the Register and that appear to have the largest membership. This has had the result for employers that they, in most cases, do not know who their valid interlocutor for negotiations is or, in the worst case, there is none that is registered.
.Therefore, these regulations, which have generated considerable legal uncertainty, impose constraints that have a very negative impact on the normal functioning of trade unions and employers' organizations, in addition to the high level of interference by the Government, and clearly violate the freedom of association and trade union freedoms protected by ILO Convention No. . Furthermore, this regulation was adopted, like the LOTTT, without consultation with the most representative employers' organization in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which has led to a recurring violation of ILO Convention No. .
.The issue of working time or the working hours of workers was one of the matters in the LOTTT subjected to a vacatio legis of one year, so that its implementation would be effective on  May .
.Prior to that date, the new President of the Republic, Nicolas Maduro, by presidential Decree No.  dated  April , delivered a Partial Regulation for the LOTTT with regard to working time, published in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela No.  of  April , which laid down specific aspects of the new working day of workers, their active working time and their hours or days off. It also established, as a general principle, the -hour week and two days off per week as continuous rest.
.The regulation sought to resolve the difficulties faced by employers and workers in the implementation of the new working time under the LOTTT, particularly the continuous break of two days, for which the law had not foreseen exceptional arrangements to cover situations of continuous work or those requiring special schedules for their working days (such as sowing and the raising of livestock, which require peak periods of working without interruption), which has had negative consequences for employers, who feared increases in their payrolls to meet the need for mandatory breaks and decided to close their businesses on Sundays, and for workers, who were affected in their pay and food subsidy where their hours of rest had to increase; there were also negative effects for consumers, who tried, without luck, to access consumption-oriented businesses on weekends (restaurants, sports shops, shopping centres, etc.), many of which were closed or operated only during limited hours on weekends as a result of the restrictions arising from this regulation.
.All of this only serves to demonstrate that there was no timely, effective dialogue when this labour legislation governing the working time was promulgated. Had things been otherwise, the disadvantages described for employers, workers and consumers would not have arisen.
.The regulation tried to resolve some of the difficulties that had arisen and gave some consideration to some exceptions to the general working time, regulating special days for operations that are continuous and are performed in shifts (article ), provided that the workday should not exceed  hours, including time to eat and rest; the total hours worked is averaged over an eight-week period and should not, on average over the period, exceed the limit of  hours per week. The regulation also indicated that during each seven-day period workers should enjoy at least one day of rest.
.Regarding the weekly rest, article  of the regulation stipulates that all workers are entitled to two consecutive days of rest per week including Sunday, so that could be Saturday and Sunday, or Sunday and Monday. However, exceptions were established: if work cannot be interrupted (three types of grounds were offered: reasons of public interest, technical reasons, or other circumstances), different days from the usual ones may be agreed, provided that they are continuous. In cases of continuous and shift work, the days of rest may also be other than Sunday and there is no obligation that they be continuous. Those who work on Sundays are paid, in addition to normal salary, an extra  per cent. On the other hand, the regulation states that, if an employee works a holiday, he is not entitled to compensatory time off, but only to additional pay amounting to  per cent.
.Clearly, regulation of this type, which affects the daily workday and has implications for workers, employers and consumers, should be the subject of consultations with those affected prior to implementation, but again the Venezuelan Government has violated the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), without the possibility of using the presence or absence of favourable content to justify its failure to consult. This regulation continues to face difficulties in its implementation, a fact that compromises business productivity, and it should have been submitted, no excuses allowed, for public consultation, in particular with the most representative employers' organization in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela: FEDECAMARAS.
.Given the circumstances described and the clear and ongoing violations of the ILO Conventions mentioned, namely, Nos  and , by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, action on the part of the ILO is indispensable in order to encourage and require the Venezuelan Government, once again, to give urgent and effective fulfilment of the requirement for social dialogue and strict adherence to the exercise of the freedom of association, in response to the commitments made by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela within the ILO.
.In the case of the land owned by the former President of FEDECAMARAS and chairperson of the Network for the Defence of Labour, Property and the Constitution, Mr Vicente Brito, whose land is situated in the Costo Abajo area of Boquern parish and is called  Hato Brazil'  in the town of Maturn in Monagas State, the complainants add that, during the recovery of that land initiated by the Government body called the National Land Institute (INTI), the appeal filed by that citizen against the land recovery measures in July  was rejected, as evidenced by the notice published on  April  in the newspaper La Prensa de Monagas, appearing in the city of Maturn in Monagas State, in the public notices section on page , by which Mr Vicente Brito was notified that the land recovery measure with regard to his plot of land  Hato Brazil' had been ratified, and that a portion consisting of  hectares with  square meters of that land would be allocated on a loan contract to the socialist enterprise Corporacin Venezolana de Alimentos (CVAL), in accordance with the Plan of Economic and Social Development and Technical Cooperation in the Area of Soybean Production, concluded between the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.Likewise, the notice stated that INTI urges the Regional Land Office of Monagas State to verify the potential beneficiaries of the land redistribution affecting the remaining portion of  Hato Brazil'  approximately  hectares, and priority should be given to those potential occupants thereof who are ready to turn the land into productive economic units, after complying with the legal requirements. A portion of the land was left over, on which a treatment plant had been established, and the order was given to safeguard and protect areas where improvements had been carried out and those where there was agricultural activity or livestock production.
.The announcement gave express notice to Mr Vicente Brito and any other person who might have a subjective right or legitimate interest in the matter that, in view of the fact that the action affects their rights and interests, they could file an administrative appeal for annulment with the competent Superior Agrarian Court (see the newspaper notice in Annex E).
.As mentioned in the complaint, the land included  hectares of grass and cassava planted by Mr Vicente Brito, which have currently been devastated.
.Likewise, it is important to note that this new decision not only ratified the recovery of Mr Vicente Brito s land, but also recognized the rights of occupants who were not covered by the first recovery measure.
.In summary, we",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
144,"must note that, in all, ten different appropriations have been imposed on land owned by Mr Vicente Brito by various public authorities, such as: INTI, the mayor s office of Maturn, the Monagas State governor s office and CORPOELEC, and that his land has also been subject to invasions by groups and organizations of government supporters.
.Statements to the media by the former President of FEDECAMARAS and chairperson of the Network for the Defence of Labour, Property and the Constitution, Mr Vicente Brito, can be seen at: http://www.lapatilla.com/ site////vicente-brito-el-gobierno-insiste-en-desconocer-la-propiedad-privasa/.
.The Government measure constitutes a new further violation of Convention No. , in as much as the person concerned is a former President of FEDECAMARAS, who has continued his official and public complaints against acts injurious to his property.
.The cases reported by FEDECAMARAS herein and forming part of Complaint No.  submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO are evidence of harassment and constant attacks by the Venezuelan Government and its supporters against businessmen who oppose the Government publicly, including specifically the attacks against the organization that represents the largest number of employers in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, FEDECAMARAS; clearly, the continued failure by the Venezuelan Government to comply with ILO Conventions Nos  and  and the facts alleged here constitute a violation of the constitutional right of citizens to economic freedom and a severe impairment of the freedom of association and the right to organize protected by Convention No. . Likewise, the Government has violated the rights of the most representative employers' organization in the country, FEDECAMARAS, and its right to consultation and inclusion in the social dialogue protected by ILO Convention No. .
.The complainants stress the following points:?The facts underlying this extension of Complaint No.  provide ever clearer proof of the continued and repeated breaches by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of the principles, rights and obligations enshrined in Conventions Nos  and , signed and ratified by that country as a member of the ILO, and of its failure to comply with the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association.?It is imperative that the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela cease its constant violations of Convention No.  on tripartite consultation and social dialogue and that it include FEDECAMARAS as the most representative employers' organization in the country, in order to prevent further decisions on economic and social and labour policy from being taken in the absence of that dialogue, which is deepening the economic crisis and harming the availability of goods and services in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, as such decisions do not correspond in some cases to the reality in the country.?The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela must end its policy of constant aggression against the business sector and its representatives in the form of speech and legal or factual measures that contravene the constitutional rights of private property and free enterprise; those measures also constitute violations of Convention No. , which protects the right of freedom of association. Also, the Government should heed the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association concerning the matters complained of.
.Moreover, the complainant organizations request that the Committee on Freedom of Association, bearing in mind all of the background and the new allegations, coupled with the Venezuelan Government s failure to heed the previous recommendations of the Committee, rule again and forcefully in this case and require the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to cease its practices in violation of the freedom of association and of the obligation to maintain a dialogue with the most representative organizations, and to comply strictly with the obligations arising under international agreements signed with the ILO, in particular Conventions Nos  and .
.Finally, the complainant organizations count on the visit of the high-level mission of the ILO, established in order to examine in person the validity and seriousness of the allegations of violations by the Venezuelan Government contained in Complaint No.  submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association, to enable the facilitation by the ILO of mechanisms for dialogue between employers and the Venezuelan Government, which will open up possibilities for a solution aimed at reactivating production in the country for the benefit of the Venezuelan people.
.The complainants request the Committee on Freedom of Association to close the investigation of the following allegations, originally incorporated in Complaint No.  but now withdrawn, namely: () the Organic Act of the Central Planning Commission, given that this law has a programmatic content that has not undergone the further development of regulations that would be in direct violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and , the complainants voluntarily request the ILO to remove that allegation from the investigation under Complaint No. ; and () the case of Carlos Sequera Ypez, who told FEDECAMARAS to remove his case from the allegations in Complaint No. , which is why the complainants ask the ILO to remove that allegation from the investigation associated with Complaint No. .
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report of June  agrees with some of the Government s arguments and clarifications. It is pleased, in particular, that the Committee seems to understand that it lacks the competence to designate certain acts as criminal offences. In that regard, the Committee noted that its comments were critical in nature, whereas the Government wishes to emphasize that the Committee should not comment in any way on facts without the necessary evidence or relevant supporting information, as such declarations without any sort of foundation lack objectivity. The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has repeatedly called on the Committee not to exceed its jurisdiction, reminding it that it is not a court with criminal jurisdiction with the authority to tell a government whether or not to file criminal charges against particular persons after an investigation, since that is up to the courts of the country. Once again the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates its appeal to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO not to continue exceeding its mandate, not to pass judgement on matters without knowledge of the facts and to stop commenting on criminal proceedings being conducted by the relevant authorities in the country.
.On the other hand, with regard to a series of unfounded accusations made by the complainants against Government officials concerning certain documents (emails) in relation to alleged financing and favouritism towards parallel organizations, the Government is pleased that the Committee has taken note of its statements regarding the false and unfounded nature of those allegations and has indicated, very tentatively, with regard to those allegations that it will not pursue its examination thereof. The Government hopes that that will be the case, so that the consistency, transparency and objectivity that should characterize the Committee in all its decisions and in all cases presented to it are maintained.
.Moreover, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela wishes to place special emphasis on paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, which states that:  With regard to its earlier recommendations (g), (h) and (m) requesting the complainant organizations for information on the Planning Commission Act, the allegations regarding the livestock farmer Franklin Brito and the expropriation of Agroislea SA, Owens Illinois and the Orinoco steel plant'  given that the additional information requested has not been received, the Committee will not pursue its examination of those allegations. All of this because the Government specifically asked the Committee to show consistency with its treatment of other cases and decide that the consideration of those allegations closed, as the appropriate supporting material has not been provided. The Government welcomes and appreciates this decision of the Committee and expects the decision to remain firm and final, bearing in mind that a reasonable time has already passed, as set by the Committee itself, for the complainants to support and substantiate their accusations and allegations and that that necessary foundation had not been provided. The Government, therefore, once again calls for consistency, transparency and objectivity on the part of this supervisory body in the study of this case.
.With respect to the high-level mission that has been scheduled to visit the country since its approval in , the Government once again emphasizes that the visit has been postponed several times for reasons not attributable to the Government; however, once again, the Government, showing its willingness in a letter dated  June  addressed to the Director-General of the ILO, Mr Guy Ryder, again invited the mission to visit the country from  to  January . It was, therefore, untimely for the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report to request that the Office contact the Government to urge that the mission take place in the near future, given that the Government had diligently, long before the publication of the Committee s report, officially announced the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
145,"new dates for the mission. The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela wishes to remind the Committee that, during the meeting of the Governing Body in November , the complainants used this complaint to urge, as a matter of urgency, the application of article  against the country. During the meeting of the Governing Body in February , the Government agreed to the visit to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of a high-level mission to verify the pending issues concerning Case No. ; however, that mission, approved more than two years ago, has been postponed several times for reasons beyond the Government s control.
.The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela states that it has, abiding strictly by the decision of the Governing Body, been in constant communication with the Office and has been accommodating and cooperative in this case, showing its full willingness, setting precise dates, presenting schedules of activities, and providing logistical facilities, among other things.
.The Government has entirely and respectfully accepted the postponements, but it is very curious that, on the one hand, the case has been repeatedly declared to be serious and urgent by the Committee on Freedom of Association and, on the other hand, the high-level mission has been postponed at various times through no fault and for reasons not attributable to the Government, without even the provision of precise explanations. We believe, however, that something that is serious and urgent should not be delayed.
.Regarding the complainants' letter of  August  concerning the regulations issued by the National Executive on labour matters that allegedly violate ILO Conventions Nos  and , the Government refers to Resolution No.  dated  April , issued by the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which regulates the National Register of Workers' and Employers' Organizations, and wishes to state that the Register has existed from the time of the Labour Act of  to the Labour Act of  (the act prior to the current one). That is to say, the existence of the Register has been provided for in all of the labour acts that have been enacted in the country, including the current legislation, which has been endorsed by the ILO itself. The only change in the current Act on Labour and Workers is that the Register has now become a single National Register, whereas it had formerly been dispersed among the state authorities, which often precluded the collection of complete information about the workers' and employers' organizations in the country, but the existence of the Register and the requirements for its composition have been the same in all of the labour acts of the country. The Government adds that it was the ILO itself, specifically the Credentials Committee, which had been established for various International Labour Conferences, which called on the Government to establish objective and verifiable criteria for determining the representativeness of employers' and workers' organizations. Therefore, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela considers that the most objective mechanism for establishing the representativeness of such organizations is through the National Register of Workers' and Employers' Organizations, bearing in mind, among other things, the comments that the ILO has been making on the subject.
.The Government firmly denies that the legislation in question generates, as claimed by the complainants, impediments with very negative impact on the normal functioning of trade unions and, even less so, interference by the Government that undermines the freedom of association, in violation of Convention No. . The Government hopes that the Committee will cease focusing on this mechanism or the Government itself and will recognize this legal provision and the work being done to establish this objective, verifiable, secure and transparent system, which will make it possible to verify the representativeness of employers' and workers' organizations in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which represents a criterion requested by the ILO itself.
.Regarding the allegations concerning the Partial Regulation on working time relating to the Decree with the rank, power and force of the LOTTT, the Government states that on  April  the Partial Regulation relating to the Decree of the Organic Act on Labour entered into effect; it refers exclusively to the regulation of working time and the workday, bearing in mind the provisions of the new LOTTT, which has been in effect since  April .
.The Government adds that, in the context of the entry into force of the working time stipulated in the LOTTT, the Higher Labour Council, established under the seventh transitional provision of that Act and which is a body consisting of employers, workers and the Government, issued a regulation on the provisions of the Act regarding working hours, updating what was stated in the previous regulation. The most relevant aspect of the subject matter contained in this partial regulation relates to exceptions to the prohibition against working on holidays in the Labour Act.
.The Government states that there has been no conflict with regard to that issue; on the contrary, the Special Inspection Plan has shown  per cent compliance with the regulation; some problems exist only in specific areas, such as commerce. All of this despite the media campaign against this modern law that various political opposition organizations such as FEDECAMARAS have maintained for over a year.
.Regarding the additional information on the case of Mr Vicente Brito, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela states emphatically that this allegation has no connection with the proper subject matter of the Committee (Conventions Nos  and ). The process of land recovery being carried out by the National Land Institute is being done for reasons of public utility and social interest, is widely supported and is based on national laws. The land recovery process is based on an established legal procedure and on national agencies that have competence in the matter. In particular, if someone believes that an action, as carried out, affects some personal right or if he has a legitimate interest in the matter, he can file a contentious administrative appeal with the Superior Agrarian Court. In addition, the Government wishes to emphasize that these procedures, carried out by the National Land Institute, which is the Venezuelan national body with jurisdiction in this matter, are not directed against trade unions or union members. The fact that someone has been a member of an organization does not exclude the application of the law and internal procedures with respect to that person. The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela once again calls on the Committee on Freedom of Association to ensure that any allegations introduced before the Committee are relevant and consistent with the purpose, competence and field of study of the Committee on Freedom of Association. The Government strongly hopes that the Committee will not exceed its competence or seek to interfere in matters beyond its mandate, and will, on the contrary, call upon the complainants to exhaust all domestic channels and make use of the appropriate bodies to exercise existing legal mechanisms in the country. Moreover, the Government notes that the complainants have withdrawn their allegations regarding the Organic Law on the Central Planning Commission and the case of Mr Carlos Sequera Yepez.
.Regarding the cases of Mr Franklin Brito, Owens IlIinois, Agroislea SA and SIDOR, the Government recalls that the Committee on Freedom of Association itself stated that it would not pursue its examination of those allegations, given that evidence and supporting material for them have not been provided. The Government wishes only to affirm that it hopes that that decision by the Committee will remain firm and irrevocable, so as to ensure that the supervisory body gives proof of uniformity, consistency, transparency and objectivity in the study of this case, given that the Committee referred to a lack of information from the complainants with regard to Cases Nos  (paras  and ) and  (paras  and (d) of the th Report (June )).
.Finally, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela wishes again to request the Committee to show objectivity, transparency and impartiality in its analysis of the arguments and accusations that make up this claim, since, as has been reported on several occasions, the conclusions emanating from the Committee on this case have often been unfounded, contradictory, vague and subjective, far removed from what should be expected from the supervisory bodies of the ILO. The Government reserves the opportunity to further expand its reply.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government reiterates its appreciation for the visit by the high-level mission to the country from  to  January  to address the pending issues in Case No.  submitted by FEDECAMARAS and the IOE to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO.
.The Government states that the unfolding of the mission provided repeated evidence of the great commitment and genuine wish on the part of the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to have the facts and complaints submitted to the ILO by FEDECAMARAS and the IOE clarified. The agenda of",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
146,"the mission was agreed between the mission and the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and the mission proceeded and successfully carried out its task.
.The Government has communicated the information received from INTI and the Public Prosecutor s Office in relation to the cases discussed during the meetings held between the mission and the aforementioned institutions. Specifically, in the information sent by the Public Prosecutor s Office and verbally supported by the representatives of that institution in the meeting held with the ILO mission, the following highlights stand out:' On the criminal act committed against FEDECAMARAS leaders in  and in which Ms Albis Muoz was wounded, the Prosecutor s Office provided the information that the hearing of the suspects is scheduled for  March . Furthermore, the representatives of the Prosecutor s Office stated that, after the investigation and related procedures had been carried out, those responsible had been determined. It was shown that the incident involved an ordinary crime (short abduction) in which the victims had not been attacked on account of their status as business leaders or members of FEDECAMARAS. The representatives of the Prosecutor s Office reported that the file also contains a communication in which Ms Albis Muoz recognizes that she has been notified and expresses her desire not to attend the court proceedings.' With regard to the incident at FEDECAMARAS headquarters in  (explosive device), the Prosecutor s Office reported that the perpetrator died when placing the explosive device, two other persons involved were detained and they were prosecuted in accordance with the relevant procedure.' In relation to the alleged investigation of Mr Noel Alvarez, the former President of FEDECAMARAS, because of some of his statements, the Prosecutor s Office reported that there were no proceedings under way, nor had he been charged with any crime, nor was there any charge against the citizen in question.
.On the other hand, the Government s reply continues, with regard to the information that was sent by INTI on cases that form part of Case No.  and which was fully explained by the representatives of that institution during the visit of the ILO mission, the following highlights stand out:(a) the representatives of that institution explained the difference between the process of recovering land and the expropriation procedure, as well as their constitutional and legal bases. Specifically, the cases contained in Case No.  involved the procedure of land recovery, which takes place when the persons concerned do not prove ownership of the land;(b) in relation to the cases of Messrs Manuel Cipriano Heredia and Eduardo Gomez Sigala, the INTI representatives reported that those persons had not demonstrated their ownership of the lands that they claimed to own, so that the procedure followed was that of land recovery. The annexes include various judgments: one dated  February  issued by the Third Superior Agrarian Court of the Judicial District of Lara State, and one dated April ,  issued by the Special Agrarian Chamber of the Social Appeals Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice [Llano Alto Agroindustrial Complex and Hato El Zamuro Pantaleonero v. Manuel Cipriano Heredia]; and further judgments: one dated  April  issued by the Third Superior Agrarian Court of the Judicial District of Lara State, and one dated  December  issued by the Special Agrarian Chamber of the Social Appeals Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice [La Bureche Farm v. Eduardo Gmez Sigala];(c) with regard to the case of citizen Rafael Marcial Garmendia, INTI said that that citizen had demonstrated ownership of part of the land, of which he continues to be in possession. The annexes include various judgments: one dated  August  issued by the Third Superior Agrarian Court of the Judicial District of Lara State, and one dated  August  issued by the Special Agrarian Chamber of Social Appeals Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice [El Casquillo Stockbreeders and Bucarito Farm v. Rafael Marcial Garmendia]; and(d) with regard to other cases reported in Complaint No. , INTI said it has no information on these alleged cases in its records and archives.
.Moreover, the Government states that all of the information that it receives from the institutions visited during the ILO mission to the country will be sent to the ILO.
.All this is being done to ensure that this official information, which was sent and produced by the institutional representatives who participated in the work of the ILO mission to the country, is taken into account in the preparation of the report to be presented to the next session of the Governing Body of the ILO in March .
.Finally, the Government requests that the best efforts and strong commitment to fairness, transparency and objectivity, which should characterize this worthy Organization, are devoted in the preparation and presentation of the report on the high-level mission that visited the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in January  in relation to matters pending in Case No.  presented by FEDECAMARAS and the IOE.
.In its communication dated  May , with regard to the assertions of alleged acts of violence and threats against FEDECAMARAS and their employers, specifically about the sequestration and abuse against FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villasmil and Ms Albis Muoz, the Government reiterates its previous information and requests the Committee on Freedom of Association not to pursue its examination of the case since it is clear that it has no connection with situations of violation of freedom of association.
.Regarding the bombing of the FEDECAMARAS headquarters in February , the Government states that the perpetrator died when placing the explosive device and the other persons involved were prosecuted.
.Concerning the allegations relating to the confiscation of property belonging to employers' leaders Messrs Eduardo Gmez Sigala, Egildo Lujn, Vicente Brito, Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Government reiterates its previous comments. Concerning cases of Messrs Elgildo Lujn and Vicente Brito, the Government reports that the INTI indicated that there is no information on file regarding any land recovery in respect of the mentioned names and requested that the name of the legal person registered as holding the corresponding land be reported.
.The Government adds that the application of the Law on Land and Agrarian Development and the implementation of procedures by the State agencies in the matter did not give rise to acts of anti-union discrimination or harassment, and that the state does not show arbitrariness in the application of its land policy. Procedures and mechanisms for recovery and the expropriation of land are determined by national law and implemented by the competent bodies. Therefore, to the extent that the policies of land and agrarian development are not material to be examined by the Committee on Freedom of Association, the Government requests the Committee not to continue examining these cases since they do not give rise to any violation of freedom of association and even less to acts of anti-union persecution.
.The Government also wishes to reaffirm that there are no plans to reform the legislation and asked that it be duly noted that clarification on the evidence reported in paragraphs  and  and in footnote  of the report of the high-level mission (GB./INS/).
.With regard to the allegations related to the expropriation of enterprises, the Government indicates that the lack of trade union persecution in the implementation of procedures for the expropriation of enterprises on the grounds of public interest has been demonstrated. Moreover, insofar as these have not been considered either in the conclusions or in the recommendations of the report of the tripartite high-level mission which visited the country, the Government requests the Committee on Freedom of Association not to pursue the examination of these allegations. In all cases, it has been exposed that decisions have been taken to respond to repeated and chronic situations affecting production sectors of vital importance to the country such as food (packaging glass ' Owens Illinois), housing (iron bars ' SIDETUR) and agricultural production (means of production for agriculture ' Agroislea SA). There was no, either from these companies or their representatives, trade union activity which could justify expropriation or that could give rise to a review by the Committee on Freedom of Association. Expropriation in question are part of the implementation of economic policy evaluation is not within the competence of the Committee since it does not affect union rights and collective bargaining. In all cases, the relevant legal procedures were followed, including a step of negotiation and conciliation during which it was not possible to agree on the assessment of the value of companies, due to which the parties have initiated legal proceedings that are ongoing.
.Concerning the alleged lack of social dialogue and tripartite consultations, the Government reiterates its previous statements and adds that it had, once again, summoned all the stakeholders in the country to a national Conference on peace and among other things, roundtables on economic matters in which FEDECAMARAS has, for the first time, taken part. The organization is currently participating in the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
147,"broader social dialogue in the country. The Government notes with satisfaction the statement contained in paragraph  of the report of the tripartite high-level mission, whereby the mission took into consideration the inclusive dialogue highlighted by the Government and taking place in the country in the framework of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Government also reaffirms that the respect and implementation of ILO Conventions on freedom of association; collective bargaining and social dialogue are not challenged in the country.
.The Government states that, in accordance with the recommendations made by the Governing Body in March , a consultation process is underway with the trade unions, chambers and professional associations, land committees, rural committees, municipal councils and other peoples' organizations concerning the elaboration of the action plan for the establishment of forums for dialogue, all in full compliance with the constitutional and legal framework of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela scheduling. In addition, the consultation also includes themes for which the government could seek the technical assistance of the ILO.
.The ILO will be informed once the consultations with various interested organizations are concluded. Despite these consultations and as reported in its communication of  March  delivered during the Governing Body session, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reaffirms its position on the recommendations contained in the mission report:?Concerning a dialogue round table that will address  other existing problems that may arise in the future in this area' (recovery of estates), the Government informed that this proposal is not viable to the extent that, first, it is not possible to establish a dialogue round table to address issues that could possibly arise in an uncertain future, and second, Article  of the Law on Land and Agrarian Development establishes a clear procedure which cannot be negotiated between two parts.?A  ripartite dialogue round table cannot be mandated to conduct consultations on laws. It could at most be one of the bodies consulted. The Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is very clear about the competencies related to the consultation, the adoption or the exemption of laws.?Discussions on laws and bills are within the competence of the National Assembly. Likewise, the socio-economic policy of the country lays under the jurisdiction of the National Executive power, in coordination with the other authorities of the State, this without limiting mechanisms for dialogue and consultation that already exist in the country and are put in place with the various sectors concerned. Consultations may be made, among other bodies, under a tripartite round table which cannot be erected as a supra-constitutional body.?There is no national law that would violate the rights contained in the ILO Conventions mentioned since this would be unconstitutional. In this respect, there is no legal action against any law of the country for which the Constitutional Courts would have granted remedy. It is unclear to what extent the ILO tripartite mission refers to when it indicates as an objective for the tripartite dialogue round table to achieve  compliance of national legislation with ratified Conventions'  The Government recommends that the Committee on Freedom of Association and the other supervisory bodies analyse Articles  to  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which is the source of all the labour laws of the country, in order to determine whether some of the provisions are contrary to ratified Conventions.?The judicial or administrative procedures in force must be concluded and carried out by the competent institutions in accordance with the national legislation.
.As a conclusion, the Government reaffirms all aspects of its written reply given during the discussion at the Governing Body in March  and which contained replies to the report of the tripartite high-level mission conducted in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (GB./INS/). The Government once again considers with concern the maintenance of the assumption that the facts reported by employers' organizations are treated as anti-union acts of persecution whereas it has been demonstrated that these acts constitute common crime acts for some and for others that the disclosures are of unfounded nature. The Government requires once again that the complaints submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association or any other body be received only when accompanied by the relevant evidence in order to avoid unnecessary procedures and discomfort. It is shown that the mission conducted to analyse the remaining issues of Case No.  exceeded its jurisdiction by including in its report new elements that do not correspond to the mandate given by the Governing Body. In particular, relevant information related to the mandate of the mission has been omitted while other elements outside its mandate and competence have been widely developed in the report. The Government will not deliver on supposed facts contained in the report of the mission and which exceeds its competences. It urges the Committee on Freedom of Association to analyse the alleged new facts when they are accompanied by relevant evidence and findings.
.The mission in question took place from  to  January , and the report on its work can be found in document GB./INS/. The appendix contains the decision of the Governing Body on that report, which was adopted on  March .
.The Committee notes the new allegations and additional information from the IOE and FECECAMARAS, the Government s new replies, the report of the high-level tripartite mission held in the country from  to  January  and the decisions of the Governing Body at its th meeting in March , and in particular the decision concerning the remission of mission s report to the Committee for consideration in the examination of this case (No. ). The Committee welcomes the mission s report and appreciates that the Government has provided facilities and much information to the mission. The Committee also notes that the mission wishes in its report to thank all its partners for their cooperation.
.The Committee notes that the complainants have withdrawn, for the reasons stated in their letter of  August , the allegations concerning the Organic Law of the Central Planning Commission and Carlos Sequera Yepez, which were analysed in previous examinations of Case No. . The Committee notes, moreover, that, as stated in the mission s report and the Government s reply, there is, according to the authorities (the Public Prosecutor s Office), no criminal investigation under way in connection with public statements made on  December  by the then President of FEDECAMARAS, Noel Alvarez, who was neither indicted nor called as a witness. The Committee addressed that issue in its previous report [see the th Report, para. , recommendation (b)] and, taking into account the information obtained by the mission, will not pursue its examination of that issue.
.The Committee further notes the Government s view that the Committee has exceeded its mandate in certain cases relating to criminal proceedings and to the recovery of land from leaders of the employers. The Committee has already responded to that opinion in previous examinations of the case and refers to the conclusions it made in that regard [see, for example, the rd Report, para. ]. The Committee observes that the Government considers that the mission exceeded its powers because of the inclusion in the report of new elements beyond outstanding issues in the framework of Case No. . Nevertheless, the Committee believes that the mission did not exceed its mandate and expressed information obtained on outstanding issues.
.The Committee recalls that the pending issues in this respect refer to the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter having been wounded by three bullets and to the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February .
.The Committee notes the Government s information in its communication of  February  and the information received from the Public Prosecutor s Office mentioned in the report of the high-level tripartite mission and, in particular, that: () with regard to the crime committed against the FEDECAMARAS leaders in  and in which Albis Muoz was wounded, the Prosecutor s Office provided the information that the hearing of the suspects before the court is scheduled for  March ; also, representatives of the Prosecutor s Office stated that, after the investigations and relevant procedures had been completed, those responsible had been identified and that the incident had involved a common crime (short abduction) and that the attack had not been related to the victims' status as business leaders or FEDECAMARAS members; () the file contained a document in which Albis Muoz stated that she had been notified and expressed her desire not to attend the court proceedings; and () with regard to the act committed at FEDECAMARAS headquarters in  (explosive device), the Prosecutor s Office reported that the perpetrator had died while placing the explosive device and that two others involved had been arrested and prosecuted in accordance with the appropriate procedure.
.The Committee notes the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
148,"information obtained from the mission s report on pending issues relating to the acts of violence.. The mission received information from senior representatives of public institutions regarding the measures adopted to combat common criminality, and in particular the launch of the national anti-violence programme with the coordinated participation of all state bodies and the civil society, seeking a change in to the situation of violence. They added that the level of common violence, which has oscillated over the last  years, is not directed at the social partners and, therefore, in no way restricts the exercise of freedom of association. According to the Forensic, Penal and Criminal Investigations Unit (CICPC), the measures taken over the last year have already resulted in a significant decrease in the number of murders and abductions.Allegations of acts of violence and threats against the employers' organization FEDECAMARAS and its officials. Regarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS officials, Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (who was shot and seriously injured) in October , the CICPC reported that within a week of the event, the police s part of the investigation had been completed, leading to the identification of the four perpetrators of the theft and assault (one of whom recently died in a confrontation with the police) who were part of a violent gang that had committed similar crimes prior to this event. The hearing in the proceedings against the accused had been postponed due to Ms Albis Muoz s decision not to attend the proceedings. The authorities indicated that the case is pending trial and that another hearing has been scheduled for  March .. In this respect, the mission noted that FEDECAMARAS reported that: () the Public Prosecutor s Office charged three individuals (Mr Andrius Hernndez, Mr Antonio Silva Moyega and Mr Jaror Manjares) with the offence; () on  February , the th preliminary proceedings court of Caracas held the first preliminary hearing and admitted the evidence provided; () on  December , the prosecutor brought charges against two of the accused (Mr Hernndez is reported to have died in a confrontation with the police); Ms Albis Muoz did not identify the accused as the perpetrators; () the accused were charged with, inter alia, brief abduction, the attempted aggravated theft of a vehicle and criminal association; () on  April , the date of the first trial hearing was announced, but it was deferred on a number of occasions and, although the preliminary proceedings court upheld the charges, it has not yet opened the trial; and () to date no one has been found responsible for the offence and the trial against the accused has not even been formally opened.. s regards the allegation that a criminal investigation was launched following the public declarations of the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, on  December , the Public Prosecutor s Office reported that no such investigation exists and that Mr Noel lvarez had been neither charged nor summoned as a witness.. Regarding the bomb attack on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the CICPC indicated that the person who threw the explosive (a grenade) died in this act of violence. Two other persons linked to the event were identified and proceedings against them are currently at the oral and public trial stage. The CICPC also indicated that it had not been able to determine the motives for the attack and it recalled that it had occurred at a time when similar attacks were being carried out on several embassies.. The mission noted that FEDECAMARAS reported that: () the person who planted the bomb (the police inspector, Mr Hctor Serrano) died as a result of the explosion; () on  February , a complaint was filed with the Public Prosecutor s Office; () on  August , the Public Prosecutor s Office issued a ruling ordering the case to be closed for lack of sufficient evidence to establish a guilty party, which was appealed by FEDECAMARAS; () on  May , the CICPC announced the detention of a public official, police officer Mr Crisstomo Montoya, for an act of terrorism in planting the explosive device (it is reported that this person would have been released) and Ms Ivonne Mrquez was also implicated; () the th court of first instance scheduled the public hearing of the oral trial for  November , which was deferred to  October ; and () to date no one has been found guilty of the attack.
.The Committee takes note of the new moral character information concerning acts of intimidation and violence received by the mission:. The mission noted that FEDECAMARAS reported that the authorities accuse the organization of waging an  economic war' against the Government. Specifically, FEDECAMARAS reports that: () in the context of the country s increasing economic problems, the Government developed a communication strategy in the run-up to the municipal elections of  December  aimed at laying the blame for the crisis on the Venezuelan productive sector, and in particular on FEDECAMARAS, the National Commerce and Services Council (CONSECOMERCIO) and the Venezuelan American Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VENAMCHAM), whom it accused of waging an  economic war' against the Government and raising the inflation rate through speculation and by hoarding products; () the Government first distributed a poster in the streets, also placing it in some public offices along with messages inciting hatred against various association leaders (the Presidents of FEDECAMARAS, CONSECOMERCIO, the National Association of Supermarkets (ANSA), the Venezuelan Food Industry Association (CAVIDEA), the National Federation of Stockbreeders of Venezuela (FEDENAGA), among others, accusing them of starving the people; () in November , the President of the Republic appeared on national television personally attacking the current president of FEDECAMARAS and accusing him of leading the  economic war'  () further attacks were carried out against the FEDECAMARAS headquarters: (i) on  October , the Bolivarian Socialist Confederation of Workers of Venezuela sent out a press release calling for the seizure of the headquarters of FEDECAMARAS, CONSECOMERCIO and VENAMCHAM on  October; on  October, the state television channel VTV invited the public to join the demonstration; and (ii) on  November , the  Tupamaro' Bolivarian armed community group took the FEDECAMARAS headquarters, carried out acts of violence, attacked the security guards and brought down the institution s flag to burn it; () prior to the municipal elections, the Government initiated occupations of shops (mainly chains selling electrical appliances), denouncing surcharges of , per cent and inciting the population to go to the shops to  empty the shelves' in some kind of product clearance. Shop seizures were shown on national television, systematically featuring accusations against FEDECAMARAS, CONSECOMERCIO and VENAMCHAM as those responsible for the  economic war against the country'  Supermarkets, hardware, toy, textile and shoe shops, as well as shops selling car parts, were seized and the goods taken have not been replaced. FEDECAMARAS officials told the mission that for two years, and even during the Government s offensive, it has continued to request dialogue to resolve the country s problems, but that the Government maintains its offensive against FEDECAMARAS, refusing to enter into dialogue with the institution. They added that the President of FEDECAMARAS has been threatened with imprisonment.
.The Committee takes note of the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission relating to the alleged acts of violence [see the mission s report: paras ' ].. The mission noted with concern that, according to the testimonies given to the mission and to press reports during its visit, there is a very large number of acts of violence that stem from common criminality in the country. In this regard, the mission is grateful for the information communicated by the Government according to which measures have been taken to launch a national anti-violence action plan in which all state institutions and citizens will participate in a coordinated manner to seek a change in the situation of violence; according to the authorities, the measures adopted over the last year have led to a significant decline in the number of murders and abductions.. The mission received information on the acts of violence denounced in Case No.  which affect employer leaders and the headquarters of FEDECAMARAS, which will be examined and assessed by the Committee on Freedom of Association. The mission noted that although, according to the Government, the investigations into some of the acts were concluded very quickly ' for example, in the case of the attack against Ms Albis Muoz and the temporary abduction of other employer leaders, where the police investigation was concluded in five days ' the judicial proceedings are still ongoing and that the corresponding verdicts have therefore not been handed down, despite the fact that the events occurred in  and . The Government states that the hearing in the proceedings against the persons accused of attacking Ms Albis Muoz was postponed owing to the latter s",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
149,"failure to appear. The judicial delay resulting from this and other serious acts that took place several years ago is a cause for concern for FEDECAMARAS. While it notes that the hearing in the case of the attack against Ms Albis Muoz is scheduled to take place on  March , the mission emphasizes the importance of concluding the legal proceedings resulting from the various acts of violence mentioned above in the very near future in order to determine responsibilities and to issue severe punishments to the culprits.. The mission noted with concern, firstly, the information recently received on the use of the media to make serious personal allegations against leaders of FEDECAMARAS, CONSECOMERCIO and VENAMCHAM to the effect that they are waging an  economic war' against the Government, and, secondly, the fresh allegations of acts of violence against the headquarters of FEDECAMARAS by certain Bolivarian organizations and the Government s incitement to vandalism and to the sacking of supermarkets and businesses. In this regard, the mission highlights the seriousness of these acts and that a climate free from intimidation, threats and excessive language is essential for the effective exercise of trade union rights and freedom of association. This is the only way to achieve normality in the organizations' activities and solid and stable industrial relations.
.The Committee notes that the plan of action to be developed by the Government in relation to the complaint, setting specific stages and time frames, should include  the identification of the causes of problems related to judicial and administrative proceedings affecting workers' and employers' organizations and their representatives with a view to finding solutions that will settle all matters pending in Case No. ' 
.The Committee wishes to express its deep concern at the serious and various forms of stigmatization and intimidation carried out by the Bolivarian authorities or groups or organizations against FEDECAMARAS as an institution, against its affiliated organizations and against their leaders and affiliated companies, which are widely described in the mission s report, including threats of incarceration, the placement of posters instigating hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the occupation of businesses, the incitement to vandalism and looting, etc. The Committee recalls that for the contribution of trade unions and employers' organizations to be properly useful and credible, they must be able to carry out their activities in a climate of freedom and security. This implies that, in so far as they may consider that they do not have the basic freedom to fulfil their mission directly, trade unions and employers' organizations would be justified in demanding that these freedoms and the right to exercise them be recognized and that these demands be considered as coming within the scope of legitimate trade union activities. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed, and that a climate of violence, in which attacks are made against trade union premises and property, constitutes serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights; such situations call for severe measures to be taken by the authorities, and in particular the arraignment of those presumed to be responsible before an independent judicial authority [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras ,  and ]. The Committee recalls that the recent events join others in the past, which include attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in  and  and the kidnapping and mistreatment in  of several of the employers' leaders in FEDECAMARAS, and bullet wounds inflicted on a leader. The Committee wishes to emphasize the violence of those attacks, which should have no place in a state governed by the rule of law, and which respects the fundamental rights of the person. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the importance of taking strong measures to prevent such threats, statements that incite hatred towards and the looting of people and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests in the framework of Conventions Nos  and , ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and, in the case of FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and affiliates. The Committee once again draws the Government s attention to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers can only develop in a climate free from violence, intimidation and fear, as such insecure situations are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. . The Committee requests the Government to ensure compliance with this principle.
.Furthermore, the Committee regrets that the criminal proceedings in the case concerning the bombing of the headquarters of FEDECAMARAS on  February  and the kidnapping and mistreatment in  of the leaders of that organization, Noel Alvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Albis Muoz (who was wounded by three bullets) have not yet been completed, expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded without further delay and requests the Government to keep it informed. In the event of assaults on the physical or moral integrity of individuals, the Committee has considered that an independent judicial inquiry should be instituted immediately with a view to fully clarifying the facts, determining responsibility, punishing those responsible and preventing the repetition of such acts. The Committee emphasizes that the absence of judgments against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights, and that justice delayed is justice denied [see Digest, op. cit., paras ,  and ]. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators of these crimes be sentenced in a manner commensurate with the severity of those crimes, so that they are not repeated, and of compensating FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned for the damage caused by those illegal acts.Recommendations (e) and (f) of the previous examination of the case(e) Regarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to employers' leader Eduardo Gmez Sigala and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s reply to the effect that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee looks forward to receiving the information that the Government says it will send and again calls on it to return the farm without delay to the employers' leader and to compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the authorities' seizure of his farm.(f) Regarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders Egildo Lujn, Vicente Brito, Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination and once again requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay, to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the payment of compensation has been decided.
.The Committee notes that, in the case of the land owned by the former President of FEDECAMARAS and chairperson of the Network for the Defence of Labour, Property and the Constitution, Vicente Brito, situated in the Costo Abajo sector of Boqueron parish, referred to collectively as  Hato Brazil'  in the town of Maturn in Monagas State, IOE and FEDECAMARAS report that, in the context of the recovery of that land initiated by the Government body called INTI, the appeal filed by Vicente Brito with the Institute against the land recovery in July of  was rejected, which ratified the recovery procedure being applied to the plot of land called  Hato Brazil'  and that a portion of that land consisting of  acres with , square meters will be transferred to the socialist enterprise Corporacin Venezolana de Alimentos (CVAL) on a loan contract, in accordance with the Plan of Economic and Social Development and Technical Cooperation in the Area of Soybean Production between Brazil and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Also, according to the complainant organizations, the INTI is urging the Regional Land Office of Monagas State to verify the potential beneficiaries of the land regularization, which was what happened to the remaining portion of  Hato Brazil'  approximately  acres, and to give priority to those occupants thereof who are ready to turn the land into productive economic units, after complying with the legal requirements. A piece of land was set aside, on which a treatment plant had been established and an order was given to safeguard and",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
150,"protect areas on which improvements had been made and those where there was agricultural activity or livestock production. Notice was given to Vicente Brito and any person who might have a personal right or legitimate interest in the matter, that, considering that the action taken affected those rights and interests, they could exercise the recourse of filing an administrative appeal for annulment with the appropriate Superior Agrarian Court. As was argued in the complaint, that lands included  hectares of grass and cassava planted by Vicente Brito, which were now devastated. Furthermore, according to the allegations, this new decision not only ratified the recovery of Vicente Brito s land but also recognized the rights of occupants who had not been covered by the first recovery measure. In summary, there are now ten appropriations, in total, affecting land owned by citizen Vicente Brito, brought by various public authorities, such as INTI, the city hall of Maturn, the government of Monagas State and CORPOELEC, and his land had also been subject to invasions by groups and organizations supporting the Government. The complainant organizations finally indicate that this government measure constitutes a new and continuing violation of Convention No.  on freedom of association, as the person affected is a former President of FEDECAMARAS who has maintained his official and public complaints about acts or incidents attacking his property.
.The Committee notes that the Government states emphatically that the allegations concerning Vicente Brito bear no relation to the proper subject matter of the Committee on Freedom of Association (Conventions Nos  and ). The process of land recovery being carried out by the National Land Institute is being done for reasons of public utility or social interest and is widely supported and based on national laws. The land recovery involves an established legal procedure and national agencies that have jurisdiction in the matter, especially if someone believes that the act performed affects some personal right or has a legitimate interest in the matter, in which case one can file a contentious administrative appeal with the Superior Agrarian Court. In addition, the procedures being carried out by the National Land Institute, the Venezuelan State body competent in this area, are not directed against trade unions or trade union members. The fact that someone has been part of an organization does not preclude the application of the law and domestic procedures.
.The Committee notes that the Government offers the following summary of the information submitted to the high-level tripartite mission: (a) the representatives of INTI make a distinction between the process of land recovery and that of expropriation and their constitutional and legal bases. Specifically, the cases contained in Case No.  relate to procedures of land recovery, which are applied when the persons concerned do not prove ownership of the land; (b) with regard to the cases of Manuel Cipriano Heredia and Eduardo Gomez Sigala, the INTI representatives reported that those persons did not demonstrate ownership of the lands they claimed to possess, so that the procedure followed was that of recovering land. Various judgments were annexed by the Government, one dated  February , issued by the Third Superior Agrarian Court of the Judicial District of Lara State, and one dated  April , issued by the Special Agrarian Chamber of the Social Appeals Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice [Llano Alto Agroindustrial Complex and Hato El Zamuro Pantaleonero v. Manuel Cipriano Heredia]; along with more judgments, one dated  April , issued by the Third Agrarian Superior Court of the Judicial District of Lara State, and one dated  December , issued by the Special Agrarian Chamber of the Social Appeal Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice [La Bureche Farm v. Eduardo Gomez Sigala]; (c) with regard to the case of citizen Rafael Marcial Garmendia, INTI said that he had demonstrated his ownership of a portion of the land, of which he continues to be in possession. In this respect, the Government annexed various judgments, one dated  August , issued by the Third Superior Agrarian Court of the Judicial District of Lara State, and one dated  August , issued by the Special Agrarian Chamber of the Social Appeals Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice [El Casquillo Farming and Stockraising and Bucarito Farm v. Rafael Marcial Garmendia]; and (d) with reference to other cases reported or contained in Case No. , INTI said that it has no information on those alleged cases in its records and archives. The Committee expresses its surprise at the Government s statement that it does not exist in the archives of the INTI information concerning possible recoveries or expropriation of land for Messrs Egildo Lujn and Vicente Brito.
.The Committee takes note of the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission on the allegations with regard to the seizure of farms belonging to employers' leaders or former leaders.. The mission received information from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and in particular of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land and of the National Land Institute (INTI) as well as from the Supreme Court of Justice in relation to three of the cases contained in Case No.  (Mr Sigala, Mr Garmendia and Mr Heredia). They indicated that in those three cases the land was recovered on the grounds that it had been left idle, and that it was recovered rather than expropriated given that the occupants had not been able to demonstrate their ownership of the land. In any event, the procedure defined by the Land Act was followed and the rules of due process observed. They indicated that in all cases of land recovery, where the persons who occupied the land are able to demonstrate that they have made improvements to it, they are entitled to compensation (according to the Government, in , US$ million was paid out throughout the country in compensation for recovery procedures). They also reported that Venezuelan law does not recognize acquisitive prescription against the State (with the exception of indigenous peoples). They indicated that in recent years, a large number of recoveries have been carried out (approximately ,) and that those affecting the officials of FEDECAMARAS are only a minute proportion of the recoveries, which shows that neither employers' nor workers' organizations are being persecuted through the land recovery policy.. s regards the case of Mr Sigala (La Bureche farm), the INTI authorities reported that the following actions had been carried out: () the administrative courts declared the land idle and the recovery proceedings were initiated on  March ; Mr Sigala s authorized representatives filed an appeal for annulment before the High Agrarian Court of Lara State, which was rejected in a ruling of  April ; on  December , the Special Agrarian Chamber rejected an appeal against that ruling. Furthermore, according to the information communicated by the Supreme Court of Justice, two appeals for annulment under case AA-S, brought before the administrative courts by Mr Sigala, are still pending (in a ruling of  November , the Supreme Court of Justice upheld one of the appeals for annulment submitted by Mr Sigala on grounds of procedural errors. The case was referred to a court of appeal.). The state representatives indicated that to date Mr Sigala s ownership of the estate has not been demonstrated in court. FEDECAMARAS representatives referred the mission back to the information submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association, in particular highlighting that its recommendations regarding the return of land and the payment of compensation have not been carried out.. s regards the case of Mr Heredia, it was reported that the appeals that he filed were rejected and that he has not been able to demonstrate his ownership of the land. As regards the case of Mr Garmendia, the recovery carried out only affected part of the land that he occupied (, hectares) and his ownership of , hectares was acknowledged. FEDECAMARAS informed the mission that Mr Garmendia has not received compensation for the recovery of his land.. s regards the estates of the employer officials Mr Egildo Lujn and Mr Vicente Brito, the authorities reported that there is no information on file regarding any land recovery in respect of the mentioned names. FEDECAMARAS reported that the Government continues to disregard the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association requesting it to restore the farm Las Misiones to Mr Vicente Brito and pay him fair compensation.New information regarding the recovery, occupation and expropriation of land. Purthermore, FEDECAMARAS informed the mission of new cases (ten) of land recovery, occupation and expropriation (in relation to various expropriations, it alleges that neither the procedure established by the Act on expropriations, nor the payment of the evaluated property price was observed; other cases concern threats of expropriation of the land belonging to Mr Vicente Brito). In general, FEDECAMARAS informed the mission that the employer officials affected by recovery proceedings on their land hold valid ownership rights over those lands and that the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
151,"criteria used to determine whether land is idle allow the State broad discretion.Allegations regarding the expropriation of enterprises. The authorities and in particular the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic reported that in cases affecting the general interest, the Council of Ministers can issue an expropriation decision explaining the public interests served by the expropriation. The Counsel-General s Office is responsible for enforcing the decision, firstly by exhausting all conciliatory remedies and, where necessary, by referring the matter to the courts. They indicated that in recent years  expropriations have been carried out and that these expropriations did respect the employers' and workers' freedom of association. The authorities referred to various cases of expropriation following collective disputes in enterprises where the employer had refused to enter into collective bargaining and to reach agreements.. s regards some of the specific cases contained in Case No. , the authorities reported the following: () Agroislea SA: this expropriation did not violate any international standards and the enterprise is currently managed by an ad hoc board which respects the workers' collective rights; () Illinois: this case is the subject of international arbitration proceedings; () Orinoco iron and steel: the case is closed. The enterprise was sold following an agreement with the owners. It currently operates with , workers; and () Turbio iron and steel: the enterprise was declared of public utility following a labour dispute which brought the enterprise to a standstill for several months. No agreement was reached regarding its liabilities and an appeal is still pending in this regard. The national complainant organization referred to some of the cases within this case in the last allegations it submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association, indicating that it would send further information in this regard.
.The Committee notes that in its communication of  May  the Government states that there is no union persecution on expropriation of businesses which take place under expropriation proceedings for reasons of public interest and requests that the government does not continue consideration of this question.
.The Committee takes note of the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission with regard to the alleged recovery of land and expropriation of businesses [see the mission s report, paras ' ]:. The mission received numerous pieces of information relating to the cases mentioned in Case No.  and took particular note of the authorities' statement to the effect that employers' and workers' organizations and their officials and members are not persecuted as a result of the policy for the recovery and expropriation of land. The mission notes that judicial and administrative proceedings are still ongoing in a number of cases; while it draws attention to the delay in those proceedings, it firmly expects that they will be concluded in the near future. The mission also noted that, according to FEDECAMARAS, the criteria for determining the idleness of the land that is recovered give the State considerable discretion and that, contrary to the request made by the Committee on Freedom of Association, the employer officials have not been compensated. The Government informed the mission that a legal reform aimed at simplifying the criteria for determining the productivity of land was under examination. Furthermore, the mission noted with concern the information on new acts of recovery, occupation and expropriation of properties belonging to an employer official of FEDECAMARAS.. The mission highlights the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land, or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property, and trusts that the bill to amend the law governing land announced by the Government will be the subject of full consultations with representative workers' and employers' organizations and that it will be adopted in the near future.
.The Committee notes with concern the recent information from the Government indicating that it is not intended, contrary to what is stated in the report of the mission, to reform the Law on Land and Agrarian Development; it also notes the Government s request that the Committee does not pursue the examination of allegations concerning the confiscation of estate insofar as the land policy and agrarian development is not a matter to be discussed by the Committee and that these cases did not give rise to any violation of freedom of association or to acts of anti union persecution.
.The Committee reiterates recommendations (e) and (f) of its previous examination of the case, calling for those leaders or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS to be fairly compensated. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body of March , which  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  The report of the high level mission also refers to  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises (including the new information communicated to the mission) and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee requests the Government to implement that request and to report thereon.
.Furthermore, the Committee, like the mission, notes with concern information received concerning new acts of recovery, occupation and expropriation applied to the property of an employers' leader of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee considers that acts of recovery (confiscation) and occupation of property of leaders of employers' or workers' organizations are contrary to freedom of association if they are taken as a consequence of their activities as representatives of such organizations.
.Finally, the Committee emphasizes, as did the high level tripartite mission,  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land, or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' 
.The Committee regrets to note, from the report of the high-level tripartite mission, that the Tripartite Commission on minimum wages, which had existed under the previous labour legislation, has been abolished under the new legislation (the LOTTT).
.The Committee notes the new allegations made by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS dated  August , in which they state that the Government, again ignoring the Committee s recommendations, has continued to issue regulations with significant impact on both private Venezuelan companies and their workers without proper tripartite consultation and social dialogue, in particular without including FEDECAMARAS as the most representative employers' organization in the country.
.The complainant organizations reject the Government s argument about an alleged opting out of social dialogue and provide ample evidence of calls for social dialogue on the part of FEDECAMARAS, and emphasize that it is not enough to hold round tables for dialogue with businessmen in certain case to deal with specific issues. The complainant organizations refer more specifically to two regulations adopted without consultation with FEDECAMARAS:
.According to the complainants, the resolution develops the LOTTT and was, like the referred Act, adopted, despite its importance, without consultations with FEDECAMARAS and under an Enabling Act that excluded its passage by the Legislative Assembly. The regulation subjects the registration of organizations to the discretion of the Ministry of Labour, whose refusal to register a organization disenfranchises that organization from appearing as a legitimate partner at the level at which it was established; the only legitimate organizations are those that appears to have the greatest number of members; also under the LOTTT, membership lists must be provided; all of this poses problems for the employer seeking to know its partner and creates legal uncertainty.
.The complainant organizations point out that this regulation was not the subject of consultations with FEDECAMARAS and poses a threat to business productivity and has led to very significant disadvantages and practical difficulties for companies, which is extensively discussed in the complaint.
.The Committee notes that in its response the Government states, with regard to Resolution No.  on the registration of organizations, that the Register of Trade Unions has existed legally since the Labour Act of  and that the main change is that now the record is unique and has a national character, not like before when there were records in the various states, which often precluded the collection of complete information; according to the Government, the requirements for the composition of the record have not changed; in addition, the Government indicates that this national record is the most objective mechanism for establishing the representativeness of such organizations, as has been urged by the ILO bodies, and stresses that this does not represent interference by the Government nor does it violate Convention No. ; it is rather an objective, verifiable, secure and transparent system.
.The Committee notes from the Government s statements that the decree on working time, which develops the LOTTT and came into force on  April , has not generated any type of conflict and the",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
152,"Special Plan of Inspections has found  per cent compliance with the regulation, with some problems existing only in specific areas such as commerce.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not denied the lack of consultations with FEDECAMARAS on Resolution No.  of  April  dealing with the registration of organizations and issued by the People s Ministry for Labour and Social Security, or on the decree regarding the regulation on the working time, which went into effect on  April . The Committee also notes that these were, however, regulations that affect the interests of businesses and employers' and workers' organizations. The Committee has drawn the attention of governments to the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee considers that in order to conduct a review, in accordance with the Conventions dealing with the freedom of association, of all of the elements of the resolution on the registration of organizations, it would require information on the practical implementation of that resolution, but stresses the importance of the fact that the legislation should establish mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality of union membership.
.The Committee takes note of the summaries of the interviews conducted by the high-level tripartite mission (paras ' , '  and  on social dialogue).
.The Committee notes that the Government s representatives described to the mission the principles of an inclusive dialogue, that there have been numerous contacts and meetings between the authorities and sectoral chambers of FEDECAMARAS, that they were willing to work to further improve the dialogue with the employers' and workers' organizations and that the Government did not exclude the possibility of availing itself of technical cooperation programmes if necessary; however, the dialogue should be transparent and honest and must be based on respect and mutual recognition [see the mission s report, paragraph ]; the Government s representatives also complained that FEDECAMARAS and the employers' organizations do not provide membership data to the labour authorities.
.The Committee wishes to reproduce the mission s conclusions with regard to social dialogue [see paras '  of the mission report]:Social dialogueThe mission notes that FEDECAMARAS continues to state that there are serious deficiencies in terms of social dialogue and that it is not consulted except on rare occasions and in relation to minimum wage fixing, when it is not given sufficient time to reply. The mission also notes that FEDECAMARAS and the Government concur that some associations that are members of FEDECAMARAS are consulted on occasion.The mission notes that the Government continues to state that, within the framework of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of , it engages in  inclusive dialogue' on a massive scale. The mission also notes that the Government continues to make frequent references to the coup d at of  and to the involvement of representatives of FEDECAMARAS therein, who it considers should make a public apology for their actions. Moreover, the mission took note of the Government s statement to the effect that it was prepared to work to continue improving dialogue with workers' and employers' organizations, provided that the dialogue is based on respect and mutual recognition and that it takes place within the framework of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. In view of the time that has elapsed and the change in the leadership of FEDECAMARAS, as well as its statements of respect for the Constitution, the mission considers that social dialogue should be established with this organization.In this regard, the mission states that it is logical for FEDECAMARAS, as an institution that has member associations in every region of the country and in the  most important production and business sectors of the Venezuelan economy (agriculture, banking, trade, construction, energy, industry, social media, mining, livestock, insurance, telecommunications, transport, tourism and property), to be consulted on the drafting of all legislation concerning industrial relations and on economic or social measures that affect its members. In this regard, the mission noted that, for example, FEDECAMARAS is not represented on the Higher Labour Council while FEDEINDUSTRIA is, which constitutes discrimination against FEDECAMARAS.The mission highlights the fact that the trade union organizations also expressed their commitment to tripartite social dialogue and their willingness to be consulted on matters relating to labour legislation and to social and economic matters.In this regard, the mission recalls the importance of creating the conditions necessary for initiating tripartite social dialogue with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations on matters relating to industrial relations, which requires a constructive spirit, good faith, mutual respect and respect for the freedom of association and independence of the parties, in-depth discussions over a reasonable period, and efforts to find, as far as possible, shared solutions that will, to a certain extent, attenuate the polarization afflicting Venezuelan society. The mission highlights that the inclusive dialogue recommended by the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is fully compatible with the existence of tripartite social dialogue bodies and that any negative experience of tripartism in the past should not compromise the application of ILO Conventions concerning freedom of association, collective bargaining and social dialogue, or undermine the contribution made by tripartism in all ILO member States.In keeping with the conclusions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, the mission reminded the Government that it can avail itself of the technical assistance of the International Labour Office, not only in matters concerning social dialogue and structured bodies, but also in the adoption of criteria and procedures to measure the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The mission noted that the Government made a general statement to the effect that it does not rule out the possibility of availing itself of technical cooperation programmes, if necessary. The mission considers that the Government needs to convey its willingness to do so in more specific terms. In keeping with the concern expressed above, the mission strongly invites the Government to consider the following recommendations.Technical cooperationRecalling, in keeping with the views expressed by the Committee on Freedom of Association, the need for and the importance of establishing structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue in the country and noting that no tangible progress has been made in that regard, the mission considers it essential for immediate action to be taken to build a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The mission considers that it is necessary for the Government to devise a plan of action that includes stages and specific time frames for its implementation, and which provides for:() The establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises (including the new information communicated to the mission) and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future.() The establishment of a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO, that is presided over by an independent chairperson who has the trust of all the sectors, that duly respects the representativeness of employers' and workers' organizations in its composition, that meets periodically to deal with all matters relating to industrial relations decided upon by the parties, and that includes the holding of consultations on new legislation to be adopted concerning labour, social or economic matters (including within the framework of the Enabling Act) among its main objectives. The criteria used to determine the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations must be based on objective procedures that fully respect the principles set out by the ILO. Therefore, the mission believes that it is important for the Government to be able to avail itself of the technical assistance of the ILO to that end.() The discussion of laws, bills, other regulations and socio-economic policy at the tripartite dialogue round table, with a view to bringing domestic legislation into conformity with the Conventions concerning freedom of association and collective bargaining ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.() The identification of the causes of the problems related to administrative and judicial proceedings that affect workers' and employers' organizations and their representatives, with a view to finding solutions that will settle all matters pending in Case No. .
.The Committee notes that, in its communication of  May , the Government states that it recently convened all stakeholders in the country at a national conference on peace and dialogue in economic matters in which FEDECAMARAS is involved. The Committee welcomes this information. The Committee notes that the Governing Body, at its session in March , took note of the report of the high-level tripartite mission and  urged the Government ... to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners; and requested the Director-General to provide the required assistance to that end' 
.The",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
153,"Committee notes that the Government states that, in accordance with the recommendations made by the Governing Body in March , a consultation process is under way with the trade unions, chambers and professional associations, land committees, rural committees, local councils and other peoples' organizations in the development and content of the action plan for the establishment of forums for dialogue, all in full compliance with the legal and constitutional structure of the Republic Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; moreover, the consultation also includes themes for which the Government could seek ILO technical cooperation; the ILO will be informed once the consultations with various relevant organizations are concluded, however, it should be noted that: () a dialogue round table to address the recovery of land is not viable under the Act land and Agrarian development; () a  ripartite dialogue round table cannot be mandated to conduct consultations on laws. It could however be a consulted in so far as the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is very clear about competencies related to the consultation, the adoption or the exemption of laws; discussion on laws and bills is the responsibility of the National Assembly; similarly, the socio-economic policy of the country lays under the jurisdiction of the National Executive power, in coordination with authorities of the State without limiting the mechanisms for dialogue and consultation that already exist in the country and are implemented with the various sectors concerned. Consultations may be made, among other bodies, under a tripartite round table but this cannot be a supra-constitutional body. The Committee stresses the importance of rapid compliance with the decisions of the Governing Body. The Committee regrets the Government s statements that a dialogue forum on land recovery (including in cases where land has been allocated to employers' leaders or former leaders) is not feasible and concerning the establishment of structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue in the country, and that the Government has not provided yet any plan of action, in consultation with the social partners, that sets stages and specific time frames for its implementation, to be carried out in consultation with the national social partners, nor has the Government turned to the ILO in order to request technical assistance.
.The Committee recalls that the mission s conclusions also refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson.
.The Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, which were ratified by the Governing Body, and expresses the firm hope that it will in the very near future take all steps necessary to do so and report thereon. Finally, the Committee, bearing in mind the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, stresses the importance that immediate action be taken to create a climate of trust based on respect for business and labour organizations, so as to promote stable and solid industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures in this regard.
.The Committee requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose a problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.
.In light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of carrying out an economic war, the occupation and looting of stores, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee wishes to point out to the Government the importance of strong measures to avoid such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee once again draws the Government s attention to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers and employers can develop only in a climate free from violence, intimidation and fear, as such insecure situations are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. . The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for this principle.(b) The Committee regrets that the criminal proceedings relating to the bombing of the headquarters of FEDECAMARAS on  February  and the kidnapping and maltreatment in  of the leaders of that organization, Noel Alvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter was wounded by three bullets) have not yet been completed, expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators of those crimes are sentenced in a manner commensurate with the severity of the crimes, so that such crimes are not repeated, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated by the damage caused by these illegal acts.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of employers' leaders or former leaders, the Committee reiterates recommendations (e) and (f) of its previous examination of the case, requesting that those leaders or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises (including the new information communicated to the mission) and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future' and regrets that in its last communication the Government stated that a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates is not viable. The Committee urges the Government to implement this request and to report thereon. Furthermore, the Committee, as did the mission, notes with concern the information provided about new acts of recovery, occupation and expropriation of the property of an employers' leader of FEDECAMARAS. Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) In relation to the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, together with the elaboration of specific steps and concrete time frames for its implementation, and counting upon the technical assistance of the ILO recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that it has initiated a process of consultation with different sectors. It requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the mission in its conclusions referred to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. Noting with regret that the Government has not yet provided a plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and expresses the firm hope that it will take, in the very near future, all steps necessary to do so and will report thereon.(e) Finally, the Committee, guided by the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, stresses the importance of immediate action being taken to create a climate of trust based on the respect of business and labour organizations, so as to promote stable and solid industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures in this regard. The Committee requests the Government as a first step in the right direction to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of the matters dealt with in this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) subsequently sent new allegations and additional information in communications dated  February and  September .
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  October  and  May .
.The",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
154,"Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see rd Report, para. ]:(a)	Regarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee notes the Government s statement that a public hearing was scheduled for  October  and expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. At the same time, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s statement in its additional information that Ms Albis Muoz, employers' leader and one of the victims of aggression, has asserted that neither of the suspects arrested (Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression, as well as the IOE s reservations as to the idea that the motive of the aggression was car theft.(b)	Regarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. However, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation.(c)	Regarding the alleged attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee had requested FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint on the subject with the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Committee reiterates that recommendation and indicates that if the organization has not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further; noting however that an environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities is not conducive to the proposed lodging of its official complaints.(d)	Regarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the persons charged, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, have confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, that a preliminary public hearing was set for  November  and that, as soon as a final ruling on the case was handed down, the Committee would be duly informed. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties should be punished in proportion to the seriousness of the crimes committed and the employer organization compensated for the loss and damage on account of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(e)	Observing the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS or its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(f)	Regarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to the employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s judgment that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that the farm is currently a military training centre (as opposed to the Government s statement that the purpose of the land rescue procedure is to encourage the agricultural use of the Valle del Ro) or the allegation that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee therefore once again calls on the Government to respond fully to the allegations, return the farm property without delay to the employers' leader and compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm.(g)	The Committee requests the complainant organizations to send their comments on the information and observations presented by the Government concerning the expropriation of Agroislea SA, Owen Illinois and the Turbio steel plant.(h)	The Committee invites the complainants to provide their observations on the Government statement on the livestock farmer Mr Franklin Brito.(i)	Regarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay and to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Mr Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS.(j)	Regarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without any tripartite consultation of laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded specifically to these allegations of the IOE and urges it to do so without delay. Moreover, observing that the serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has once again ignored these recommendation despite the fact that the Committee has been insisting on them for years.(k)	Regarding the alleged discrimination by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and the allegations of favouritism vis--vis parallel organizations close to the Government and lacking in independence,",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
155,"the Committee reiterates the conclusions, recommendations and principles contained in its previous examination of the case and requests the Government to reply in detail to the allegations concerning the financing of parallel organizations and of favouritism vis--vis EMPREVEN and the  social production companies' and the discrimination against private companies. Regarding the IOE s new allegations concerning the sending of electronic mails between senior officials and parallel employers' organizations, the Committee calls on the Government to verify without delay with the senior officials concerned whether or not they or their representatives sent the electronic mail attached to the IOE s deposition.(l)	Regarding the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Bill, the Committee calls on the Government to ensure respect for the abovementioned principle as regards international financial assistance to workers' and employers' organizations so that, if the Bill does indeed apply to them, to take the necessary measures without delay to amend the Bill (or the Act) so as to guarantee explicitly the rights of employers' and workers' organizations to receive international financial assistance without prior authorization from the authorities for activities related to the promotion and defence of the interests of their members.(m)	Regarding the complainant organization s comments on the Central Planning Commission Act, the Committee had observed in its earlier examination of the case that the legislation establishes strong state intervention in the economy and national economic structure under the aegis of central planning in order to construct the Venezuelan socialist model and had requested the complainant organizations to provide information on the relationship between the allegations and the violation of Conventions Nos  and . The Committee reiterates this recommendation and indicates that if the organizations have not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of these allegations any further.(n)	The Committee requests the Government to send its observations in relation to the recent IOE communication dated  February  alleging repeated failure to engage in tripartite consultations with respect to legislative matters.(o)	The Committee draws the attention of the Governing Body to the serious and urgent nature of this case.
.In joint communications dated  February and  September , the IOE and the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers and Associations of Commerce and Production (FEDECAMARAS), despite the keenness that FEDECAMARAS has demonstrated in recent months to promote genuine social dialogue and tripartite consultation in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, as called for in Convention No.  ratified by Venezuela in  and Recommendation No. , no such developments have taken place. In some cases the Government has merely convened at its own discretion specific private sectors other than FEDECAMARAS, which is widely recognized by the ILO as being the most representative employers' organization in the country; in others, the consultation is a mere formality that does not allow time to reply, or else the views of the independent social partners consulted are simply ignored. On other occasions there has either been no consultation whatsoever or else it has been held just with a few hand-picked organizations that support the Government. The complainants observe that there have been further incidents have taken place in violation of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), and the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in ,  and  respectively, and that these have had negative consequences for employers in general and for FEDECAMARAS in particular, as the most representative employers' organization,.
.The complainants recall that, in paragraph (i) of its Report No.  of March , the Committee deeply deplored that the Venezuelan Government had ignored its earlier recommendations, in which it requested the Government:' to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in the various sectors and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various branches of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' to ensure that, as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer s interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.
.However, according to the complainants, the Government continued adopting a series of measures in  and  which have had a major impact on private enterprise in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which violate ILO Conventions Nos ,  and  in that they were implemented without undue consultation of the most representative employers' organization, FEDECAMARAS, and which restrict the exercise of freedom of association and violate ILO standards concerning the approval of increases in minimum wages. The relevant legal texts are discussed below.
.In Official Gazette No.  of  December  and without holding proper consultations with the social partners for the eleventh year running, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela promulgated Security of Employment Decree No. . Articles  and  of the decree stipulate that workers benefiting from special security of employment may not be dismissed, demoted or transferred without just cause having been duly certified in advance by the Labour Inspector of the jurisdiction concerned. Failure to observe this procedure automatically entitles workers to request reinstatement in their jobs and the payment of wages due. This special protection is accorded irrespective of accrued wages to: (i) workers on open-ended contracts as from the third month of employment; (ii) workers on fixed-term contracts up to the end of their contract; and (iii) workers under contract to carry out a specific job or task until the entire job or task ' or that part for which they are responsible ' has been completed. In other words, the new standard has extended the scope of employment security to all workers governed by the Organic Labour Act, whatever their wage. Article  of the Decree specifies that this protection does not apply to workers in management positions and in positions of trust or to temporary, casual or public-sector workers. The Decree came into effect upon its publication in the Official Gazette of  December , based on a decision taken without any kind of consultation, even though in recent years FEDECAMARAS had drawn attention to the inappropriateness of employment security being extended by the Executive without consulting the social partners ' which shows that there is no such things as genuine social dialogue in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.The complainants allege that Official Gazette Special Issue No.  of  May  a new Organic Labour and Workers Act was promulgated in the form of a legislative decree that was issued by the President of the Republic under the Enabling Act adopted by the National Assembly on  December , without due consultation of the most representative employers' organizations and in violation of ILO Convention No.  (see below).
.In December  the President of the Republic announced the creation of a Presidential Committee to prepare a draft reform of the Organic Labour Act. The members of the Committee were:.	Nicols Maduro, People s Minister of External Relations.	Mara Cristina Iglesias, People s Minister of Labour.	Jorge Giordani, People s Minister of Planning and Finance.	Wills Rangel, representative of the Bolivarian Socialist Federation of Urban, Rural and Seafaring Workers (CSBT), the recently established government-backed trade union of the state petroleum company.	Omar Mora, Magistrate, President of the Social Chamber of Appeals of the Supreme Court of Justice.	Francisco Torrealba, deputy of the National Assembly for the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), the Government party, and Vice-President of the Railways Section of the CSBT.	Oswaldo Vera, deputy, PSUV President of the National Assembly s Integrated Social Development Committee.	Braulio lvarez, deputy, PSUV.	Juan Rafael Perdomo, Magistrate, Vice-President of the Social Chamber of Appeals of the Supreme Court of Justice.	Jess Martnez, labour lawyer with connections to the government-inspired Bolivarian University.	Antonio Espinoza Prieto, lawyer, adviser to the PSUV.	Carlos Sainz Muoz, lawyer, legal adviser to Oswaldo Vera, deputy, President of the National Assembly s Committee on Social Affairs.	Carlos Lpez, government sector trade unionists, Coordinator of the CSBT.	Orlando Castillo, government sector trade unionist for public service employees.	Carlos Escarr (deceased) and his successor Cilia Flores, Public Prosecutor.	For the employer sector, Miguel Prez Abad, President of FEDEINDUSTRIA (a government-biased parallel body previously denounced by FEDECAMARAS in Case No. , who was appointed by the President of the Republic as a deputy member of the Council of State established by Presidential Decree No.  (Official Gazette No.  of  April ) and of the Higher Council of Labour established by Presidential Decree No.  (Official Gazette No.  of  May ) in pursuance of the Organic Labour and Workers Act.
.It is obvious from the list of members of the Presidential Committee that they are all part of the Executive, Legislative or Judiciary or are otherwise supporters of the Government. This is notably the case of",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
156,"the sole representative of the employer sector (Miguel Prez Abad, President of the Venezuelan Federation of Craft, Micro, Small and Medium-sized Business Associations (FEDEINDUSTRIA) who, as a member of the Council of State and of the Higher Council of Labour, is a direct adviser to the Venezuelan Government on matters of State and on labour affairs. (Prez Abad has issued press releases concerning his appointment.)
.Moreover, of the  members of the Higher Council of Labour  are members of the Presidential Committee, along with five public officials, three ministers and two vice-ministers of the People s Ministry of Labour and Security, which shows that the Presidential Committee is very largely made up of government supporters, virtually the only sector consulted.
.Moreover, the Labour and Workers Act contained in the Presidential Decree was issued as an Organic Act in violation of article  of the Constitution, as it was not approved by the two-thirds majority of the National Assembly required for the adoption of an organic act; instead, it is based on an Enabling Act issued by the National Assembly in  to empower the President to deal with specific issues arising exclusively from a natural disaster caused by that year s heavy rains, but which he has used to legislate on any matter he deems fit.
.In other words, no proper consultation of the most representative segments of the employer sector was held on the new Organic Labour and Workers Act, in blatant violation of ILO Convention No. .
.FEDECAMARAS was neither convened nor at any time invited to express its opinion on the Act, and the text of the draft law was almost unknown when it was published in the Official Gazette. Before that the social media had only cited the views of members of the Presidential Committee and government spokespersons on certain broad aspects of the law. The text was submitted to the President towards the end of April by the Committee that had been hand-picked; it was then approved by him at a public event on  April and promulgated on  May.
.The Government informed the media that it had received and examined , proposals, which one must assume reached the Presidential Committee from some other source without any of them being officially registered. But even if it is true that there were any number of proposals, that is no substitute for genuine social dialogue as understood by the ILO. The kind of social dialogue alluded to in Convention No.  cannot be selective; it cannot be simply the unilateral expression of opinions or proposals by non-representative social actors or sectors linked to the Government and it cannot bypass the compulsory consultation of the most representative employers' organizations in the country, that is, FEDECAMARAS.
.FEDECAMARAS naturally informed the media that the law had been passed without any social dialogue and that the Federation would apply to the ILO to denounce the violation of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), and this was in fact recognized by Oswaldo Vera, deputy, member of the Presidential Committee and PSUV President of the Standing Committee on Social Development of the National Assembly.
.The worker sector also protested against the lack of social dialogue on the proposed law and, on  March , the FADESS trade union appealed to the Supreme Court of Justice for protection under the Constitution in a bid to prevent the legislative reform being issued under an Enabling Act. It requested specifically in its appeal that the Court submit the proposed law to the National Assembly for more extensive discussion. Moreover, a number of trade unions (FADESS, CTV and others) organized a march on  May to protest against the passing of the new Act without any consultation.
.This lack of social dialogue is nothing new for the Venezuelan Government, which for over  years has failed to comply with its obligation to hold tripartite discussions on labour affairs. In the last two years particularly, the President has used the Enabling Act to appropriate the power of the Legislature to issue unilaterally a whole set of legislative decrees on all kinds of subject, as shall be seen below.
.In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Labour Act is considered to be the country s most important social contract after the Constitution. Consequently, a legislative reform of this nature needs both a consensus of the social partners and wide support from the community, which was not the case as the text of the new law was not known or publicized prior to its official promulgation.
.Moreover, the new Act imposes a series of additional economic and political burdens on the private sector:()	For employers the law is highly punitive and discriminatory, since it provides for six to  months' prison or detention for any employer who refuses to re-employ a worker, on grounds of non-compliance with administrative orders or non-payment of fines (the sanctions apply to management board members but not to the administrators of state enterprises). Moreover, natural persons in their capacity as employers are jointly and severally responsible with the shareholders for compliance with their obligations vis--vis the workers and are liable to have their assets seized.Another discriminatory aspect of the new Act is that the Government assumes none of the prior debts and liabilities of the companies it expropriates, which have to be met by the former shareholders and are deducted from the price paid.()	The Act provides for greater state intervention in labour relations, stipulating as it does that the principal objective of the social process of labour is to overcome the  capitalist form of exploitation' (i.e., production) and that the workers alone are  creators of socially produced wealth'  thereby denying capital any value as a generator of employment.()	The new Act imposes new restrictions and burdens on the employer sector that are liable to result in restrictions on investment and production by Venezuelan enterprises. For example, it makes social benefits (seniority) retroactive, the implications of which are highly negative in an inflationary context; it provides for a shorter working day; it complicates the procedure for dismissing workers and imposes penal sanctions on employers who refuse to re-employ them; it institutes employment security as a legal standard (this also applies for two years in the case of the parents of newborn children and of adoptive parents of children under the age of three.()	It institutes the concept of Workers' Councils alongside trade unions, in some cases with similar powers, under regulations issued subsequently in a special law.()	The powers of trade union organizations include supervising and monitoring the enterprise s costs and profits so as to ensure that the prices paid for its goods and services are fair.()	It establishes a Register of Workers' and Employers' Organizations within the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security through which it regulates the content of their statutes and the appointment and functioning of their executive bodies, which must conform to the guidelines set out in the Register. Each year the organizations must provide the Register with a complete list of affiliated bodies, along with any other information required. Failure to register limits the legitimacy of employers' or workers' organization to engage in collective bargaining, which means that they lose all their autonomy and severely undermines their freedom of association.
.The complainants emphasize that the Act s legal provisions clearly curtail the employers' exercise of the economic freedom and freedom of association that are provided for in both the Constitution and ILO Convention No.  and make it increasingly difficult for enterprises to continue to operate in the country, especially the small and medium-sized companies that account for  per cent of all enterprises.
.The undermining of freedom of association by the Government has already had very serious repercussions on employers in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and the new Labour Act will further aggravated the situation. In recent years the Government s economic policies have visibly caused a decline in the number of companies operating in the country. In , the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s official National Statistical Institute (INE) reported that there were , active employers. For the month of January  the INE s figures showed , employers, a drop of , since . By May  some , private employers had closed down since , and their number continues to increase steadily. More than , people could have found work in the enterprises that today are closed. An article published by the former President of FEDECAMARAS Zulia, Nstor Borjas, comparing the official figures for employers and employees between  and  confirms that the number of employers fell by . per cent during the period.
.The complainants allege that, during the  months for which the National Assembly delegated the power to legislate to the President of the Republic under article  of the Enabling Act it passed on  December , the President issued  legislative decrees between January  and May . On  June , just two days before his delegated powers came to an end on  June",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
157," and when the country was busy preparing the  October presidential elections, the President issued another  legislative decrees that had major implications for the economy ' a total of  decrees issued during the period covered by the Enabling Act.
.None of the most representative employers' organizations were consulted on these  decrees when they were promulgated by presidential decree, which means that in each case the Venezuelan Government violated the provisions of ILO Convention No. .
.There was none of the  people s participation' and  open consultation' on legislative issues that is called for in the preamble and in articles . and  of the Constitution, which do not exclude from its provisions legislative decrees issued by the President in exercise of legislative powers delegated to him by the National Assembly.
.In his use of the Enabling Act, the President of the Republic appropriated the power to legislate at his sole discretion on a whole array of issues that were not delegated to him under an Enabling Act that was adopted solely to attend to situations arising from the heavy rains in . Consequently, because they were drafted without any consultation or participation of the people and because they went beyond the matters delegated under the Enabling Act, every one of the decrees constituted a violation of the Constitution and non compliance with ILO Convention No. .
.Among the  legislative decrees issued by the President on  June , two were especially significant as they modify extensively the functioning of the economic actors and employers in the country: the Organic Act for Community Management of Skills, Services and Other Attributes (Legislative Decree No. , Official Gazette Special No.  of  June ) and the Act to Promote and Regulate New Forms of Association with the State (Legislative Decree No. , Official Gazette No.  of  June ), a private and community initiative for the development of the national economy. A third legislative decree, the Legislative Decree to Determine the Fair Price of Real Estate for Housing Purposes in Cases of Emergency (Legislative Decree No. , Official Gazette No.  of  June ), establishes the  fair price' that the Government sets unilaterally in the event of emergency expropriations.
.The first two of these legislative decrees lay down the rules and regulations for associations between the State and organized communities or private entrepreneurial entities. The decree offers a number of advantages whose objective is obviously to replace traditional private enterprise by new forms of state associations that follow government guidelines, since it is a sine qua non that such associations  promote and extend the construction of the socialist model' ' to the exclusion of any form of enterprise that is not party to that particular political model. This goes further than the definition of the Government found in the Constitution, where it is described as democratic, participative, elective, decentralized, alternating, responsible, pluralist and revocable (article ).
.These legislative decrees provide for the almost total centralization and control of economic activity by the State, since they do not contemplate the possibility of harmonious development in collaboration with private enterprise, as called for in the Constitution (article ), but rather that the State should determine how the country s economy is run in accordance with the guidelines set in the Socialist Plan of the Nation and in the new legislative decrees promoting the development of enterprises associated with the State. It is the State that plays the leading role as an economic agent in determining how the economy of the country is to function, either unilaterally or in association with enterprises or communities that are entitled to certain advantages that are designed to make the system attractive. These privileges that entrepreneurial entities gain from their association with the State include:' tax exemptions;' access to state distribution and marketing networks;' access to direct state purchases (without bidding); and' access to special loans and funds under preferential terms.
.These privileges obviously give the associations an unfair advantage in their economic dealings. Contrary to the Constitution, entrepreneurs that do not bow to the Government and to socialism are excluded, which means that independent entrepreneurial systems will eventually disappear. Both state enterprises and their associated entities should compete on equal terms with the other economic agents. The new system thus discriminates against employers that do not conform to the socialist model or set up entrepreneurial associations in which the State in any case takes all the most important decisions, According to the Act to Promote and Regulate New Forms of Association with the State, even if a private entity enters into an association with the State it still has no margin for manoeuvre in its economic activity since the decision-taker in the day-to-day running of the associations is the State, either because it is the majority shareholder or, if not, because under the law on these mixed enterprises (in which it holds a minimum of  per cent of the shares) the State has power of decision in all strategic matters (a very general concept).
.In the case of the last two decrees especially, under which the State can set up associations with community organizations and private entities committed to socialism, the President of the Republic has the power of an autocrat in deciding how the economy of the country is to function, without consulting the Venezuelan people either individually or as organized social units; it thereby violates the constitutional requirement of  democratic participation' and  open consultation' specifically where the determination of the country s socio-economic system and the harmonious development of the national economy are concerned (article ) and curtails the constitutional right to economic freedom (article ). Since, quite apart from the absence of consultation, these decrees severely restrict the exercise of freedom of association, all this points to the Government s blatant violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The third legislative decree referred to as being significant among the  decrees issued on  June  is the Legislative Decree to Determine the Fair Price of Real Estate for Housing Purposes in Cases of Emergency, according to which any enterprise and even any individual citizen expropriated by the State for housing purposes is paid only the  fair price' calculated according to the formula set out in the decree. Under the new system the State has decided that the fair price will be based on the most recent purchase price of the building indicated in the registered document of ownership, updated according to the following simple arithmetic formulas:()	variation in the national consumer price index;()	nominal interest rate on deposits of over  days; and()	nominal weighted average lending rate.Example of the impact of the '  formula for the month of MayIndex titleValueNational consumer price index.Nominal interest rate on deposits.Nominal weighted average lending rate.Indexation formula(.+.+.)/Total.>
.Moreover, the decree states explicitly that the fair price excludes:()	the market price or value;()	any influence or impact deriving from public or private investment in the area; and()	expected rental value from uses scheduled under territorial or urban development plans.
.The decree is designed to minimize as far as possible the amount payable to the persons expropriated, who suffer not only from having to leave the building but also from being unable to acquire a building of similar value with the amount paid in compensation, which does not take the market value into account. Refusing to consider the market value means ignoring the monetary value that a society operating under a system of supply and demand assigns to a product at any given moment. The new system does away with the  negotiation' of a fair price and replaces it by compulsory acquisition of the asset; even the possibility that formerly existed of appealing to the Supreme Court of Justice to set a fair price when the parties concerned cannot agree no longer exists. The decree s inclusion of this provision means that the price paid for the expropriated building is determined exclusively by the expropriating party. Imposing the price through administrative channels (which may apply for any building at all) violates of the right to private property, is tantamount to confiscation and is therefore unconstitutional. if the indexing does not take into account the building s potential rental value, enterprises will tend not to go ahead with expansion projects that involve its acquisition, as the long-term return on the project is directly linked to the building in which it is to take place. The new legal arrangement thus also violates ILO Conventions Nos  and , since the most representative employers' organization in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, FEDECAMARAS, was not consulted and since it severely restricts the exercise of economic freedom and freedom of association.
.Of course, it is impossible to say at this stage what repercussions the new legislative decrees issued by the President of the Republic ' of which only the three decrees liable to have the greatest impact on the country s employer sector have been analysed here ' will have on the normal operations of",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
158,"the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s employers.
.The complainant organizations allege that Presidential Decree No.  of  April  approving the increase in minimum wages for  was promulgated on  April, once again without any consultation of the most representative employers' organizations.
.In , without convening the National Tripartite Committee, as required explicitly by articles ,  and  of Organic Labour Act that was still in force at the time the increase in the minimum wage for the year was made official, the People s Ministry Of Labour and Social Security sent FEDECAMARAS communication No.  dated  March and received by the Federation on  March, giving it just  days to express its views on the fixing of the mandatory minimum wage. The communication was an attempt to claim the existence of social dialogue in the setting of the minimum wage for , whereas in fact it violated the basic rights and guarantees, the freedom of association and the right to a legal defence of both physical and to persons (articles  and ), as well as the very structure of a criminal code based on subjective responsibility. The law also establishes the principle of the joint and several responsibility of enterprises (article ), likewise on the basis of their objective criminal responsibility, and thus violates their right to freedom and to all constitutional guarantees. In addition, the decree establishes the principle of the enterprises' objective criminal responsibility for acts attributable to their dependents, which is a violation of the freedom of the individual and of associations as well as of their individual rights and guarantees. As further proof that the decree violates all the rights and guarantees of the individual and of enterprises, article  claims competency to conduct criminal investigations into administrative personnel not attached to the Judiciary. Yet according to the Enabling Act any issue as crucial as the increase in minimum wages has to be properly discussed in the Tripartite Committee.
.As FEDECAMARAS has repeatedly noted in complaints presented to the ILO for more than ten years, the State of Venezuela has failed to comply with this legal requirement of the Tripartite Committee regarding the fixing of the minimum wage.
.In the new Organic Act on Labour and Workers the Tripartite Committee is now not mentioned at all. Regarding the annual increase in the minimum wage the Act merely states (article ):  After due consideration, the Executive shall each year fix the minimum wage by decree. In doing so it shall conduct a broad consultation of the views of the various social organizations and socio-economic institutions'  As can be seen, the new Act omits any requirement that the most representative employers' and workers' organizations should be consulted, referring merely to the  broad consultation' of various organizations.
.The preambular paragraphs of Presidential Decree No.  of  April  concerning the minimum wage increase for  (Official Gazette No.  of  April ) states explicitly that  the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has endorsed and ratified ILO Conventions Nos ,  and  concerning minimum wage fixing, protection of wages and equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value, respectively' 
.Notwithstanding the fact that all the ILO Conventions cited as a basis for the presidential decree stipulate that the most representative employers' organizations must be consulted, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela continues to ignore this provision as it relates to minimum wage fixing, in so far as there is no genuine social dialogue on the subject but, by way of lip service to this requirement, a mere communication giving very little time for a reply which does not conform to national and international standards and is in blatant violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The complainants allege that during  the Government continued to adopt price control measures under the Costs and Fair Prices Act (Presidential Decree) of  July , which was again issued under the Enabling Act without due consultation of the social partners. This was the subject of the amplified complaint presented to the Office of the ILO Director-General on  February .
.According to article  of the Act it is designed to establish regulations and administrative and monitoring machinery for maintaining stable prices. For this purpose it creates a National Integrated Cost/Price System whose purpose, among other things, is to  identify economic agents that set excessively high prices in terms of the services they offer or the products they sell'  Given the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s insecure investment climate and its galloping inflation caused by uncontrolled public expenditure, this would suggest that it is to become a police State which, instead of punishing the real irregularities that occur because of the speculative practices of certain economic agents, will carry out ex ante investigations into the financial situation of all Venezuelan entrepreneurs in order to fix the prices of their products.
.A new bureaucratic institution is to be set up that will attempt to establish a system for supervising the whole production, marketing and distribution chain of every kind of goods or services. And a new National Price Register of Goods and Services is to be added to the large number that enterprises already have to cope with, under the responsibility of the National Cost/Price Department. Registration, which according to article  is to be compulsory, will be required for certain administrative formalities vis--vis the State.
.The Department established under the Act will be able to fix prices that it considers  fair'  based on information supplied by enterprises and its own cost structure review. Price setting depends on so many factors that this process will end up being quite arbitrary, because in practice it is impossible to assess the cost structure of all Venezuelan enterprises and all available products fast enough to set their price causing a negative impact on the availability of goods for the public. The cost structure of any product changes constantly and can be affected by a variety of factors, and so they have to be constantly revised. In most cases bodies that are set up to regulate prices are highly specialized in each sector they are concerned with and each regulates a specific group of products and services. This calls for a very large staff. But the new law is not concerned with regulating a basket of products; the same procedure may be applied to any product, and this will entail a long-drawn-out process that will encourage the growth of discretionary powers and generate a great deal of legal uncertainty for producers and consumers alike. In other words, the prime object of the law, which is to protect the population, will prove to be unattainable in practice; faced with such an uncertain situation enterprises will be inclined to reduce their output, and this which in turn will cause shortages of regulated products and ultimately penalize the population and, further down the line, of the enterprises' workers whose jobs will thus be threatened.
.Finally, the Act renders the protection of private property subject to national security and sovereignty and to public utility and the general and social interest. Article , for instance, provides for enterprises to be sanctioned by temporary occupation, a penalty that already exists under the Defence of Persons in Access to Goods and Services Act (INDEPABIS).
.It is clear from the above that the whole set of regulations in the Costs and Fair Prices Act, which has the rank, value and force of law, places severe restrictions on the right of citizens to engage in their chosen economic activity, as provided for in article  of the Constitution, and will steadily whittle away free enterprise, entrepreneurship and the constitutional rights and guarantees of the Venezuelan people as a whole. In any case, as with all the other legislative initiatives referred to here as having implications for the activity of employers, the promulgation of the Act should first have complied with the constitutional, legal and international requirement of consultation or tripartite dialogue.
.Since February  a series of products saw their maximum price regulated first in their  regular' form and then in their  premium' form, regardless of the fact that some of them come in anything from  to  different versions.
.Although the companies' manufacturing the goods were asked for financial details, the maximum prices set by SUNDECOP, the National Costs and Prices Department s regulatory body, were based on the unit cost without any allowance for other costs such as advertising, taxation, etc. Once prices have been set, companies can submit observations and ask for the prices to be revised (see Costs and Just Prices Act in Official Gazette No.  of  July , the Regulations made under Presidential Decree No.  in Official Gazette No.  of  November , and SUNDECOP s Ruling No.  in Official Gazette No.  of  November ).
.Obviously, the Government s failure to consult the most representative employers' organizations not only before promulgating the Act",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
159,"but also before its implementation (when not even the enterprises affected by the measure were consulted on the maximum prices for their products) eventually had repercussions impact on production and in many cases resulted in shortages, as has happened with such basic products as milk, meat, oil, corn flour, etc.
.On  March  the National Commerce and Services Council (CONSECOMERCIO), a trade association affiliated to FEDECAMARAS, applied to have the Costs and Just Prices Act repealed on the grounds that it violated the economic freedom and free enterprise of the employer sector as provided for in the Constitution. The appeal is currently before the Supreme Court of Justice.
.This law, which was approved by the National Assembly on  December  (likewise without the employer sector being consulted) establishes the concept of objective criminal responsibility of both physical and juridical persons (articles  and ), in violation of the minimum rights and guarantees of persons, of individual freedom and the right to a judicial defence in a court of law and of the very structure of criminal law, founded as it is on the notion of subjective responsibility. Moreover, again on the basis of objective criminal responsibility and again in violation of freedom and of all constitutional guarantees, the law provides for the joint and several responsibility of enterprises (article ). It also declares that enterprises are objectively responsibility under criminal law for all the actions of their dependents, which is a violation of the right to individual freedom and freedom of association and of the rights and guarantees of all persons and associations. Yet another demonstration of the fact that the law violates the rights and guarantees of individuals and of enterprises is article , which empowers administrative officials who are not members of the Judiciary to conduct criminal investigations.
.In deciding on the composition of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s employers' delegation to the th Session of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, from  May to  June , the People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security attempted to replace FEDECAMARAS as the leader of the delegation. By communication No. / dated  May , FEDECAMARAS was invited to a meeting at the Ministry on  May, along with other employers' organizations, to pick the delegate and technical adviser(s) who would attend the annual session of the ILO Conference.
.At the meeting, after the Ministry had received an application to be designated most representative employers' organization in a communication from FEDECAMARAS dated  April , some other employers' organizations announced that they too had submitted their own application and rejected the proposal that they be represented by FEDECAMARAS. This position was adopted by the Bolivarian Council of Manufacturers, Enterprises and Micro-enterprises (COBOIEM), which proposed that the employers' delegate be Fanny Surez of FEDEINDUSTRIA, who in turn proposed a list of technical advisers that included Miguel Valderrama, FEDEINDUSTRIA s Vice-President. During the meeting, and without any formal communication, the representative of Entrepreneurs for Venezuela (EMPREVEN) proposed that the delegation be led by its own representative, Keyla de la Rosa. Subsequently, at the invitation of the representative from the Ministry and after a series of discussions at which the representatives of the Ministry and of FEDECAMARAS were not present, the representatives of the aforementioned minority employers' organizations and of the National Confederation of Agricultural and Livestock Workers (CONFAGAN), all of whom were present at the meeting, stated that they had reached agreement on the designation of the delegate and technical advisers and withdrew their earlier applications. CONFAGAN proposed that the employer delegate be Miguel Valderrama, Vice-President of FEDEINDUSTRIA; his proposal was seconded by the other organizations apart from FEDECAMARAS, as noted in the minutes of the meeting (as if, added together, the other employers' organizations in the country could claim majority representation). The said organizations also proposed their own representatives as technical advisers to the Conference, separately from those of FEDECAMARAS.
.After this proposal had been made by the parallel organizations and at the request of the Ministry, which FEDECAMARAS challenged in the ILO as not being representative, FEDECAMARAS placed on record, at the meeting on  May  and in a communication from its President to the Ministry dated  May , that the Federation refused to accept that a member of minority employers' organization should lead the delegation and accordingly confirmed the designation of its delegation for the posts of employer delegate and technical advisers as per its communication to the Ministry dated  April , insisting that they could not be replaced by representatives of organizations which were not more representative and which could therefore only attend the Conference as observers.
.During the st Session () of the International Labour Conference FEDECAMARAS presented a complaint to the Credentials Committee because, even though the candidate proposed by the other organizations eventually declined the leadership of the delegation which was therefore undertaken by FEDECAMARAS, five technical advisers, four special guests and  other persons representing the parallel organizations also attended the Conference, that is,  people who were not members of FEDECAMARAS, the most representative employers' organization in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Eventually, the Ministry included five technical advisers and a special guest in the delegation in addition to the leader.
.In the case of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s employer delegation to the st Session of the Conference, the Credentials Committee, as on previous occasions when an attempt has been made to remove the Federation from the delegation or reduce its participation, decided in favour of FEDECAMARAS as the country s most representative organization.
.The membership of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s employer delegation has in fact been discussed again and again in the ILO and for the past  years there has never been any doubt about the Federation being the most representative organization in the country s employer sector. FEDECAMARAS covers every branch of Venezuela s  macroeconomic sectors: agriculture, banking, construction, energy, fishing, industry, mining, insurance, social media, telecommunications, trade, tourism and transport (see article  of the Federation s statutes). It also has a regional representation in every state in the country through with hundreds of affiliated Chambers, as has been clearly demonstrated to the Conference s Credentials Committee again and again. No other employers' organization in the country has been able to claim any comparable representativity and, in its third report to theth Session of the Conference in , the Conference Committee stated that the Venezuelan Government had not demonstrated to the Conference, on the basis of objective and verifiable criteria, the representativeness of any organization other than FEDECAMARAS, even offering the Government technical assistance in defining the relevant criteria. Similarly, in a decision handed down at the th American Regional Meeting of the ILO on  December , the Credentials Committee stated that the Government s application of the participatory democracy principle did not correspond to criteria for consultation drawn from principles established in the ILO and ruled that, that being so, the presence was required of both the employers' and the workers' organizations with the greatest representativeness.
.On several occasions the Ministry has maintained that a delegation can comprise more than one organization, but for that to happen the other organizations have to prove that they are as representative as they claim if they are to be recognized by the ILO as being among the most representative. This kind of mixed delegation can only be justified when more than one organization can demonstrate fully to the ILO that it is equally representative, and this is not the case in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela where the representativeness of the other organizations, even when all added together, is in no way equivalent or similar to that of FEDECAMARAS which, as already mentioned, covers all the activities of the Venezuelan economy, has regional organizations in every state in the country and has hundreds of Chambers directly or indirectly affiliated to it.
.The facts described above illustrate clearly the Venezuelan Government s intention to restrict FEDECAMARAS exercise of its trade union rights and freedom of association at the annual Sessions of the ILO Conference, in violation of the Convention No. .
.All this points yet again to the total lack of social dialogue and restrictions on freedom of association whereby the Venezuelan Government has violated ILO Conventions Nos ,  and . In doing so threatens the very existence of independent employers' organizations, especially that of FEDECAMARAS as the country s most representative employers' organization, which was not consulted prior to the adoption of any of the government measures referred to above, and this has had serious repercussions not just for the employer sector but for all Venezuelan workers. The issues raised here therefore call for the ILO s immediate attention.
.Finally, the complainant organizations request the Committee to urge the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to hold tripartite consultations to decide on the dates of the planned High-level Mission.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that it has already responded in detail",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
160,"to many of the points that the complainants are raising once again and that it confirms every one of its previous replies to the ILO s supervisory body. Its communication contains a detailed summary of all that the Government can say on the subject; in the interests of brevity, it therefore presents its partial observations, while reserving the right to continue responding to each of the points separately.
.The Government begins with the following statement:(a)	This case is linked to the High-level Mission that was agreed upon in March  and whose visit to the country has been held up for reasons outside the Government s control, as noted in information documents submitted to the th (November ), rd (March ) and th (November ) Sessions of the Governing Body. Specifically, the IOE took advantage of this complaint at the Governing Body Session in November  to request the application of article  against the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as a matter of urgency. At the Governing Body Session in February  the Government agreed that a High-level Tripartite Mission could visit the country to verify the points that were still pending with regard to Case No. . However, although the mission was approved  months ago it has twice been postponed for reasons outside the Government s control. Abiding strictly by the Governing Body s decision, the Government has maintained contact with the Office, collaborated fully on the case, made itself constantly available, set precise dates, presented a timetable for the visit, made logistical arrangements, etc. Despite the Governing Body s decision and the Government s willingness, however, the mission has twice been postponed. On both occasions the Government has respectfully accepted the postponement.(b)	With regard to the allegations in the case concerning the cattle-breeder Franklin Brito, the Agroislea SA company, Owen ' Illinois and the Turbio steelworks, the Government recalls that in its previous examination of the case the Committee requested the complainants to send comments on the information and statements sent by the Government on the subject. It therefore explicitly requests that, since the Committee has not received those comments, it state unequivocally that it does not intend to pursue its examination of the allegations and that it has concluded its examination of the matters at hand. The Government makes this request so that the Committee on Freedom of Association can maintain the uniformity, consistency and transparency of its consideration of all the cases that come before it, as it did in the face of the lack of information from the complainant in Cases Nos  (paras  and ) and  (paras  and (d)) in its th Report (June ).(c)	The Government once again draws the Committee on Freedom of Association s attention to the fact that sufficient grounds do not exist for an objective and impartial study of the allegations, and that vague and imprecise accusation cannot be admitted when, instead of being conducive to the resolution of disputes between the parties and of conforming to the Committee s fundamental purpose, they are responsible for delays in procedure and give rise to unfounded rulings against the Government.(d)	Finally, the Government requests the Committee to review carefully the extension of the allegations that has been admitted as part of the joint IOE and FEDECAMARAS complaint, since they refer to matters to which the Government has sufficiently responded and are therefore not an extension but a repetition of their allegations.
.Regarding the abduction and maltreatment of FEDECAMARAS leaders Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Albis Muoz, the Government states that it has all ready replied extensively on this matter and has taken appropriate action, as stated in paragraphs '  of the Committee s th Report (March ) and paragraph  of th Report (March ). It has supplied the same information and details to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its communication No. / of  December , which has been duly registered by the ILO s Department of Standards and was referred to by the Committee of Experts in connection with Convention No.  in Report III (Part IA) to the Conference in  [page ].
.In paragraph  of its rd Report (March ) the Committee expresses  its grave concern that according to the allegations the suspects have not been identified by Ms Albis Muoz as being responsible for the crime and that the charges do not include attempted homicide and the wounding of the employers leaders'  The Government has already stated with regard to this unfortunate incident, which the Government condemned from the outset, that it was originally presumed that five perpetrators were involved and that details had been supplied on each one. That being so, there is a major contradiction on the part of the Committee, since on the one hand it says that the two persons were not recognized by Ms Muoz but then it goes on to express concern that they were not charged with attempted murder and causing her bodily harm.
.Such a contradictory analysis is surprising. In the first place, although Ms Muoz did not recognize the facts, the Office of the Public Prosecutor considered that the investigation had provided sufficient evidence to charge the persons accused of robbing her. When the Committee makes the statement referred to, is it contesting the fact that the persons charged committed the theft? Does it have any evidence that some other persons were responsible for the incident?
.Moreover, the Committee has once again acted outside its mandate, since it is not competent in criminal matters and cannot tell a Government whether or not a person should face criminal charges following an investigation, which is strictly a matter for the country s judiciary. It would be interesting to hear why the Committee, when it expresses doubts as to the authorship of the crime without any grounds for doing so, is convinced it knows what charges should be brought against the persons in custody. Ought the Committee not explain its grounds for such a contradictory statement?
.It is worth repeating what the Government has already stated, namely, that the Committee has no competence in criminal matters and has once again gone beyond its mandate by making such false statements, as if its members were judges, and, even worse, by issuing a ruling without knowing anything about the judicial proceedings.
.The Government appeals to the Committee on Freedom of Association to stop exceeding its mandate, to stop passing judgement on matters it knows nothing about and, above all, to stop commenting on penal procedures being conducted by a country s own institutions. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s judicial system will charge the people involved in the incident with whatever crimes are appropriate, depending on the evidence that comes to light in the course of the proceedings.
.Notwithstanding the above, and in order once again to clarify the circumstances, the Government requested information from the Public Prosecutor, who replied that, regarding the case in which Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Jaror Manjares have been charged with a criminal offence, the th Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of Metropolitan Caracas set a public hearing for  October . In the course of the investigation, three other persons were presumed to have been implicated in the incident, but the Office of the Public Prosecutor has stated that no evidence has so far come to light allowing their involvement to be established beyond doubt. Moreover, one of the persons concerned was killed in a confrontation with the police in .
.With regard to the investigation ordered into the public statements made by Noel lvarez, the Public Prosecutor s Office recently stated that the investigation was in its preparatory stage and that it was taking the necessary steps to clarify the incident and determine who was responsible. The Government repeats that it is for the relevant official bodies to clarify the situation, hand down their rulings and determine who, if anyone, was responsible for the incident. The matter does not come within the mandate of the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.Regarding the events that allegedly occurred at FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Government once again finds itself obliged to reject the Committee s subjective appreciation of the circumstances as being irresponsible and, by referring to an  environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities [that] is not conducive to the proposed lodging of ... official complaints'  of being disrespectful. The Committee s partial and subjective appreciation, which the Government rejects categorically, calls into question the very institutions, authorities and Judiciary of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The leaders of FEDECAMARAS systematically use the media as part of the political strategy which the Federation s executive body pursues as an opposition faction. The Government challenges the Committee to produce the slightest evidence of any incident at FEDECAMARAS' headquarters in  that the Venezuelan people are unaware of. The Government states clearly and emphatically that it is not for the Committee",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
161,"to cast doubt on the proceedings of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s judicial authorities, which are objective, transparent, entirely lawful and devoid of the subjectivity and partisan interests demonstrated by the Committee. The Government insists that the Committee show proper respect and objectivity in dealing with the country s institutions and public authorities and trusts that there will be no repetition of its disrespectful, irresponsible and subjective proceedings and judgements. Furthermore, the Government wishes to remind the Committee that, in its previous examination of the case, it asked FEDECAMARAS to lodge an official complaint with the Public Prosecutor s Office and Committee informed it that, if the complainants did not comply with its recommendation, it would not pursue its examination of the allegations any further. The Government therefore expressly requests the Committee to rule on this point and to reject the allegations once and for all, since the complainants have not presented any complaint on the subject to the Office of the Public Prosecutor. In doing so, the Committee will be acting with the objectivity and lack of prejudice that is required of it and will be complying with the terms of its own recommendation in paragraph  (c) of its th Report (March ).
.Regarding the incidents that took place at FEDECAMARAS on  February , the Government states that the Public Prosecutor s Office has informed it that criminal charges have been brought against Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez for public intimidation and the use of false identity papers and against Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, his accomplice, for public intimidation prejudicial to the community. The th Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of Metropolitan Caracas agreed on  September  to set a new date for the public hearing, following the defence s request for postponement, and a new hearing was scheduled for  October .
.With regard to the La Bureche farm and Eduardo Gmez Sigala, the Government confirms its previous replies on the subject and will send further details when it receives them from the specialized body responsible for the strategic agro-ecological rescue plan for the Turbio Valley. Meanwhile, it is important that the Committee on Freedom of Association understand clearly that the farm has undergone the rescue procedure laid down in the Land and Agrarian Development Act, as explained previously. The Government categorically rejects and explicitly denies the unsubstantiated allegation presented by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS that the farm is  a military training centre' 
.The Government would like the Committee to explain how a feature of country s agrarian development policy to recover land and prevent arable areas from being used for urban development, which applies equally to all Venezuelan citizens, can constitute a violation of freedom of association? The fact that Gmez Sigala is or has been a member of FEDECAMARAS does not dispense him from complying with the law, unless it is the Committee s contention that a trade unionists is not subject to the law. Gmez Sigala is a deputy in the National Assembly (the legislative power), which is unequivocal proof that his trade union and political activities have never been restricted. Can the Committee explain why it believes that, in Gmez Sigala s particular case and not in others where it has been implemented, the Land and Agrarian Development Act is a violation of freedom of association. Is the Committee aware of the content of the Act, which it was previously sent?
.Regarding the cases involving lands of Egildo Lujn, Vicente Brito, Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay and to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Mr Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS. On this point the Government states that all acquisitions of property carried out by the State for purposes of public utility or social interest confer an entitlement to due payment of fair compensation in accordance with article  of the Constitution. The procedure laid down stipulates that all acquisitions are preceded by a conciliatory stage for the parties to agree on a price for the property being acquired by the State. Where no agreement as possible, the matter is submitted to a competent tribunal to set a fair price.
.In the instances referred to by the Committee and in all other instances, that has been the procedure followed. Is it to be understood from the Committee s insistence that compensation be paid  without delay' that the persons concerned renounce their right to have the fair price of the property set by a tribunal and that they accept the price fixed by the State? If that is so, the Government would appreciate being informed of its decision in writing.
.Regarding the alleged attack on buildings owned by Carlos Sequera Ypez, no such incident has been reported by the police or by any other institution in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and the Government therefore requests the Committee on Freedom of Association to provide information on the subject.
.Regarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without any tripartite consultation of laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded specifically to these allegations of the IOE and urges it to do so without delay. Moreover, observing Moreover, observing that the serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation. The Government states that consultations on all laws passed in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela are held with the entire population and with social organizations. Moreover, some of FEDECAMARAS' members are deputies in the National Assembly where the vast majority of laws are discussed. Laws approved by the President of the Republic under the Enabling Act adopted by the National Assembly have also been preceded by public consultation. The Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela provides for a referendum to revoke any laws that are approved without the requisite support of the population. FEDECAMARAS, however, has boycotted many of these consultations or has limited itself to rejecting them outright in declarations to the media, often before the law has been promulgated in an effort to prevent it from being passed. The Federation s policy of opposing any form of consultation and then saying that has not been consulted has been its strategy ever since , when the Venezuelan people opposed the Government backed by the Tripartite Committee and amended labour laws without consulting the people and in defiance of the historical rights of Venezuela s workers.
.The Government recalls that a High-level Tripartite Mission has been scheduled to visit the country for  months to verify that the country has the broadest possible consultation machinery for approving its law, but that the mission has twice been postponed at the request of the IOE. The most firmly established employers' organizations in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela participate in all the consultation procedures on these laws, usually with the exception of FEDECAMARAS for strictly political reasons.
.The new Constitution of  restored all the workers' rights that the Tripartite Committee had been infringing between  and , whereupon the Committee s members, acting as if it was a political body, started to campaign against the Constitution. They were, however, defeated, and the Constitution was approved in a referendum by the majority of the people.
.In  the members of the Tripartite Committee publicly and infamously fomented a coup d at against the constitutionally elected President and for  hours installed the President of FEDECAMARAS as de facto President of the Republic, but the people of the Bolivarian Republic Venezuela took to the streets and restored constitutional order.
.This is why today any mention of the Tripartite Committee of  evokes painful memories in the Venezuelan people and is associated with the infringement of workers' and human rights. It is also why the Constitution and other laws refer to a broad social dialogue that transcends the so-called tripartite dialogue restricted to an elite that is divorced from the country s social movements; in this new social dialogue all the social actors are involved in every decision through their organizations or directly through assemblies.
.Regarding the alleged discrimination by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and the allegations of favouritism vis--vis parallel organizations close to the Government and lacking in independence, the Committee reiterates the conclusions, recommendations and principles contained in its previous examination of the case and requests the Government to reply in detail to the allegations concerning the financing of parallel organizations and of favouritism vis--vis EMPREVEN and the  social production companies' and the discrimination against private companies. The Government states that there",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
162,"is no discrimination whatsoever against any employers' organization. Ever since it was founded in , FEDECAMARAS benefited from favouritism and financial and political support from the Government which excluded and grossly discriminated against other employers' organizations in the country, some of which still exist and can testify to the fact. The Government indicates that, prior to , every employer had to belong to a chamber that was affiliated to FEDECAMARAS in order to have access to State loans, contracts or purchases. This discriminatory and anti-union policy was abolished by the Constitution that was approved by referendum in , since when employers are free to join any organization they wish and their affiliation or non-affiliation is not a requirement for engaging in an activity with the State.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association s reference to an alleged financing of EMPREVEN has absolutely no basis in fact. The document to which it refers concerns resources that are granted to social production enterprises through that organization, as is quite clear from the document itself. There is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that the resources were for financing EMPREVEN.
.With regard to the IOE s allegations concerning the sending of electronic mails between senior officials and parallel employers' organizations, the Committee calls on the Government to verify without delay with the senior officials concerned whether or not they or their representatives sent the electronic mail attached to the IOE s deposition. The Government states emphatically that the Committee on Freedom of Association would appear not to have read its reply on the matter; it therefore feels obliged once again to refer to paras  and  of the Committee s th Report of March  in which it is reproduced. Once more the Government rejects and repudiates the IOE s attempts to give credence to electronic mail that emanates neither from the Government nor from any of its representatives.
.The Committee is ill advised to  call on the Government to verify without delay with the senior officials concerned whether or not they or their representatives sent the electronic mail attached to the IOE s deposition' as the circumstances are obvious from the paragraphs of its rd Report referred to above, unless the Committee simply wishes to delay matters. If it wanted to act coherently, juridically, objectively and in keeping with the basic legal principle of the burden of proof, it would ask the IOE to explain where it dug up, forged or invented the so-called electronic mail involving government officials. Given that the Government has already denied the existence of any such mail, the burden of proof lies with IOE to defend its allegations.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association should realize that it is the IOE that it must ask to explain this delicate matter, since ascribing this electronic mail to the Government (which once again emphatically denies that it emanated from any government official or representative) is such a serious accusation as to have criminal implications. The case is especially serious because it seeks to incriminate one of the Government s diplomatic representatives, who has categorically denied any knowledge of the email, which the Government can only assume emanates from the IOE. It is therefore for the IOE to provide a full explanation to the Committee and to the Government, which warns that it reserves the right to take any appropriate legal action in the matter
.Regarding the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Bill, the Committee calls on the Government to ensure respect for the abovementioned principle as regards international financial assistance to workers' and employers' organizations so that, if the Bill does indeed apply to them, to take the necessary measures without delay to amend the Bill (or the Act) so as to guarantee explicitly the rights of employers' and workers' organizations to receive international financial assistance without prior authorization from the authorities for activities related to the promotion and defence of the interests of their members. The Government states that the spirit of the Bill is not to prevent any organization from receiving financing for the promotion and defence of its affiliates, since if that is what the funds are for there is no reason to hide their origin or how they were used to promote the interests of their affiliates. The purpose of the future law is to prevent the financing of political activity ' or, worse still, clandestine activities ' by certain organizations to the detriment of other organizations, as a form of discrimination aimed at excluding them and promoting one set of options against another. The Government states that it will take the ILO s observations into account in drafting the future law.
.With regard to the Central Planning Commission Act, the Government recalls that, in its previous examination of this case, the Committee on Freedom of Association requested the complainant organizations to provide information on the relationship between the allegations and the violation of Conventions Nos  and  and stated that, if they did not do so by its next meeting, it would not pursue its examination of the allegations any further. The Government therefore explicitly requests the Committee to rule on the matter and, if it has not received the information it requested from the complainant organizations, that it decide not to pursue its examination of the allegations any further. It makes this request so that the Committee can maintain can maintain the uniformity, consistency and transparency of its consideration of all the cases that come before it, as it did in the face of the lack of information from the complainant in Cases Nos  (paras  and ) and  (paras  and (d)) in its th Report (June ).
.With regard to the IOE s communication of  February  concerning an alleged absence of tripartite consultation in legislative matters (Security of Employment Decree, Organic Labour and Workers Act, Costs and Fair Prices Act, Penal Law on the Environment), the Government provides the following information on the allegations and exhorts the Committee not to allow government bodies be discredited without a proper reason for doing so.
.The Security of Employment Decree is a legal measure introduced under the authority conferred on the President of the Republic to protect the people, the working class and individual workers from any arbitrary action by private sector employers. Under the capitalist system unemployment is the bane of the working class and therefore used by certain big employers to trample the workers underfoot by denying them social benefits and violating all their rights and the Constitution itself. The purpose of the decree is to protect workers' rights as a fundamental means of promoting the welfare of the people and the construction of a just and peace-loving society. The Government categorically rejects the public declarations by FEDECAMARAS spokespersons against the decree, which originated precisely in the events surrounding the coup d at of April  and the economic sabotage between December  and February  in which the CTV, FEDECAMARAS and other sectors of the bourgeoisie openly participated by dismissing of some , workers in the private sector. The fundamental objective of the Decree is to guarantee security of employment and to protect workers from employers who use unjustified dismissal as a means of punishing them for their political, class-conscious and revolutionary views.
.As to the new Organic Labour and Workers Act the Government states that, pursuant to Decree No.  published in Official Gazette No.  of  December , the President established a the committee to draft a new Act redefining labour relations on a just and balanced basis according to guidelines that are appropriate to a social state of law and justice in which workers are the counterpart to their employer. On  May saw a new, revolutionary Organic Labour and Workers Act was promulgated in whose drafting a committee composed of representatives of all sectors ' workers, peasants, employers, Government, the Judiciary and the Legislature ' had participated with the single objective of presenting a Bill that reflects the will of the people, is an expression of community interests and respects the intangible and progressive nature of workers' rights under the Constitution.
.The new law is a synthesis of ten years of National Assembly meetings with various sectors. In the six months preceding the law s promulgation alone, over , proposals were submitted directly to the Committee to be studied and debated publicly. It was this constructive national debate that gave rise to the new Labour and Workers Act.
.The new Act shows that only through social dialogue is it possible to establish the laws and labour relations that our countries so desperately need, laws that fully respect human rights. Thanks to direct dialogue with the workers and their employers it leaves possible in it was possible to draft a law that was heralded by everyone even before its promulgation and has been a key element in the sustained economic development of the country and in the reduction of unemployment to under  per cent, thus ' the gloomy forecasts",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
163,"of closed enterprises and high unemployment and demonstrating that guaranteeing and protecting workers' rights are fundamental to a countries economic stability.
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is an example of the consolidation of workers' rights and of the protection of freedom of association, collective bargaining and the right to strike, where the family is protected by extending women s entitlement to postnatal leave to  months and the security of employment of a child s parents is established until he or she is two years' old.
.The Organic Labour and Workers Act does away with child labour, prohibits outsourcing, shortens the working week to  hours, guarantees employment security for all workers, grants equal workers' rights to domestic workers and consolidates a social security system whose coverage includes non-dependent workers and which recognizes women s work as homemakers.
.Under the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s social welfare system pensions are equal to the minimum wage. Enterprises are required to provide traineeships and apprenticeships to stimulate youth employment. The fundamental rights and historic struggles of the working class that were denied by capitalism and unbridled globalization are now recognized.
.This is a far cry both from the former law, which had been imposed by closed and discriminatory form of tripartite that prevailed in , and from economic models that today are causing structural crises and a marked regression of earlier working-class attainments.
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela provides clear evidence that social dialogue with the social actors must be direct so that they cannot be blackmailed by self-serving group interests, that the collective welfare must be guarded against the manipulation of individual groups and that the national objective must be the advancement of workers' rights, because labour is fundamental to the achievement of a peace-loving society.
.As the Vice-Minister of Labour stated in plenary at the st Session of the International Labour Conference,  this was a national, a magnificent, a constructive debate that gave rise to a revolutionary Labour and Workers Act that was penned by the workers themselves and signed by our President, Hugo Chvez. It left aside those who chose not to take part in the public debate, those proponents of old-style tripartism who claim for themselves a representativity that they no longer possess and a voice in public affairs that they do not deserve' 
.Regarding the Costs and Fair Prices Act the Government emphasizes that it is designed to favour the Venezuelan people. The law stems from the need to prevent speculation, a recurrence phenomenon in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela that has severely affected the price of certain products in recent years. The Act sets out to reduce speculation and the hoarding of basic commodities ' the main cause of inflation ' by regulating, administering, monitoring and controlling prices. The price adjustments are based on a survey of production processes, transport and storage, so as to ensure that the manufacturers do not lose money but do not speculate on the people s basic needs either. The Act has many advantages:?It establishes price controls for enterprises whose profits are excessive in terms of the cost structure of the goods they produce or market and the services they provide.?It identifies economic agents that demand excessive prices for the services or products they provide.?It establishes exchange criteria that are fair.?It encourages fair prices by providing a mechanism for calculating real costs and expenditure.?It promotes administrative practices that are based on equity and social justice.?It increases economic efficiency, a decisive factor in the production of goods and services to meet people s needs.?It helps to raise the standard of living of the Venezuelan people.?It facilitates the insertion of the Venezuelan economy at the regional and international level by promoting the integration of Latin America and the Caribbean and by defending the country s economic and social interests.?It provides the means of obtaining information on technical criteria for following up consumers' complaints of speculation and other irregular practices that hamper their access to goods and services.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the Penal Act on the Environment, and notably articles , ,  and , the Government makes the following points to demonstrate how important the Act is for the implementation of international agreements and for the life-giving environment itself:?Article : criminal responsibility. In the case of environmental crimes, penal responsibility is an objective criterion based on an administrative standard. Criminal responsibility is determined by proof of an infringement of the law, not by proof of culpability.?Article : criminal responsibility of juridical persons. Juridical persons are responsible for their actions or omissions if the crime entails the violation of standards or provisions contained in laws, decrees, orders, ordinances, resolutions and other general or specific administrative rules that are compulsory.?Article : joint responsibility. Juridical persons are held jointly and severally responsible if they enter into an agreement whereby one carries out a specific piece of work for the benefit of or for use by the other and whose implementation results in risks or damage to the environment or to natural resources.?Article : criminal investigation bodies. Officials identified in the Act to establish a Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigation Department as well as in special laws and the regulations made under them are empowered to conduct criminal investigations into environmental crimes. They include:()	technical and administrative officials responsible for the monitoring and control activities of the ministry concerned with the environment, for all environmental issues;()	technical and administrative officials responsible for the monitoring and control activities of the ministries concerned with energy, petrol, mines, health, agriculture, housing and infrastructure, for matters coming within their purview;()	technical and administrative officials responsible for monitoring and control in areas under special administrative authority;()	competent officials of governorships and mayoral offices, within their sphere of competence.
.The Government goes on to state that the spirit, purpose and objective of the Act is to prevent the commission of crimes against the ecological equilibrium or against any species in the environment. The Act comes under the country s criminal jurisdiction and, as such, lists certain actions that are punishable in the specific domain of the environment. The Act provides for the preservation and protection of the country s natural resources and for the welfare of the population, which is part of the Government s basic mandate.
.Finally, the Government states that it is completely unaware of any link between this Act and Conventions Nos  and  with which the Committee is concerned. It therefore requests the Committee to explain that link explicitly or to insist that any allegation presented by the complainant organizations be related to the purpose, mandate and purview of the Committee and be duly supported by evidence.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government refers to the allegations in relation to the Enabling Act concerning the approval of new legislative decrees on economic and social affairs issued by the President of the Republic. The Government states that FEDECAMARAS is a civil association of entrepreneurs, the activities of which are of a political and non-trade union nature. The enabling Act was passed by the National Assembly with an overwhelming majority and was called into question by political sectors of the opposition who voted against its approval, which is their right.
.Nonetheless, for strictly political reasons, the political sectors of the opposition continued to contest this Act on the occasion of any activity or fact that occurred in its framework. For instance, in the context of the elaboration of several decrees issued by the President during the period for which he was empowered to do so, various organizations of national life interested in submitting proposals and recommendations were consulted, but political organizations from the opposition refrained from participating. FEDECAMARAS, which often rather reflects political positions than professional interests, declined to participate for the reason mentioned above. Thus, in the Government s view, it is absurd for FEDECAMARAS to argue that it was not consulted on these issues, when in reality it refused to participate in the debate and to present proposals or recommendations.
.As for the alleged shifting of the representation of FEDECAMARAS when establishing the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the st annual Conference of the ILO, the Government states that, every year on the occasion of the celebration of the International Labour Conference, the Ministry for Labour and Social Security calls a meeting with various business organizations in the country to discuss and agree on the formation of the employers' representation in the delegation attending the Conference. The Government emphasizes that it respects and promotes the democratic principles of the Bolivarian resolution. Therefore, while not negating the existence of FEDECAMARAS, it also recognizes the existence of other employers' organizations, regardless of their political position, since they illustrate the existing political pluralism in the country. The Government has never and will never negate the existence of an employers' organization, but it also has the obligation not to allow for the disavowal of other employers' organizations.
.As to the allegations concerning the Presidential Decree on the Minimum Wage Increases (), the Government states that, during the period '",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
164,", a National Tripartite Commission was set up, with the duty of, inter alia, annually revising the national minimum wage. Throughout this period, the minimum wage was raised only twice in nine years, in exchange for the elimination of other workers' rights such as social benefits. The new Constitution approved by referendum on  December  establishes the obligation of the State to review and fix annually the national minimum wage, i.e. through a mechanism over and above the political interests of the economic elite. In this framework, at the beginning of each year, at the request of the Government, or in some cases on their own initiative, the social, economic and trade union organizations submit their views and recommendations on the fixing of the national minimum wage. All proposals are received and analysed, whether they are presented individually by those organizations or as a result of joint meetings of several organizations. However, since the annual fixing of the minimum wage is a constitutional guarantee, it is not permitted to exchange, like on a market, the setting and value of the minimum wage against other labour rights or claims.
.Recommendation (a). Regarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee in its previous examination of the case deplored the offences that were committed, emphasized their seriousness and requested the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee noted the Government s statement that a public hearing had been scheduled for  October  and expressed the hope that the persons guilty of the crimes would soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents would not be repeated and requested the Government to keep it informed in that respect. At the same time, the Committee noted with concern the IOE s statement in its additional information that Ms Albis Muoz, employers' leader and one of the victims of aggression, had asserted that neither of the suspects arrested (Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression, as well as the IOE s reservations as to the idea that the motive of the aggression was car theft
.The Committee takes note that the Government, on the one hand, states once again that from the very outset it condemned this incident in which five perpetrators were allegedly involved and, on the other hand, draws attention to a major contradiction in the Committee s conclusions, since it says that the two persons were not recognized by Ms Muoz but then goes on to express concern that they were not charged with attempted murder and causing this employers' leader bodily harm. The Committee informs the Government that the abduction of the four employer s leaders, one of whom, Albis Muoz, received three gunshot wounds, fully justifies the Committee s concern and that the Government has not informed it of any charges having been brought for causing bodily harm or attempted murder. Contrary to the Government s assertion, the Committee s expression of concern does not exceed its mandate but testifies to its critical assessment of the findings of the investigation into the wounding of an employer s leader by bullets.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the Public Prosecutor s Office has informed it that two persons, Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Jaror Manjares, are being held in connection with the incident and that the th Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of Metropolitan Caracas ordered their public hearing to be held on  October . Three other persons were mentioned in the course of the investigation as being implicated, but the Prosecutor s Office has stated that so far no evidence has been found establishing their involvement with any degree of certainty and that one of the three died in a confrontation with the police in .
.The Committee regrets that the information provided by the Government is not such as to dispel the concerns it expressed in its previous examination of the case and it therefore reiterates its previous recommendations.
.Recommendation (b). Regarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Noel lvarez, the Government states that the Public Prosecutor s Office recently informed it that the investigation was at a preparatory stage, which implies that the Prosecutor s Office is making the necessary enquiries to clarify the incident and determine responsibilities, and that it is for the relevant official bodies and not for the Committee on Freedom of Association to do so. In its previous examination of the case the Committee noted that, in the context, the declarations did not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the decisions handed down by the authorities (Office of the Public Prosecutor, the judicial authority) in this case.
.Regarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the Office of the Public Prosecutor has informed it that: () criminal charges were brought against Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez for public intimidation and the use of false identity papers and against Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, his accomplice, for public intimidation prejudicial to the community; () the th Court of First Instance of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of Metropolitan Caracas agreed on  September  to set a new date for the public hearing following a request by the defence for its postponement, and the new hearing was scheduled for  October . The Committee stresses the importance of the perpetrators being sanctioned in a manner commensurate with the crimes committed and of the employers' organization receiving compensation for the losses and damage resulting from these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.
.Regarding the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS and its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .
.Regarding the allegation concerning the employers' leader Eduardo Gmez Sigala and the La Bureche farm, the Committee takes note that the Government confirms its earlier replies and states that it will send further details. The Committee also takes note that the Government categorically denies the allegation by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS that the farm is a military training centre. The Committee observes that the Government has not denied that this union leader has not received compensations for the confiscation of his farm. The Committee takes note of the Government s argument that the law applies to an employers' leader (who is, moreover, a deputy of the National Assembly) in the same way as it applies to any other citizen and that the Government wonders why the case is classified as a violation of freedom of association. The Committee recalls that it has already twice examined the substance of this allegation, refers the Government to its previous conclusions and recalls that it is competent to examine acts of discrimination against employers' leaders. It recalls, moreover, that when it is alleged that an act is prejudicial to an employers' or workers' leader it applies the principle of the reversal of the burden of proof and that it is therefore the Government s responsibility to demonstrate that the incident had nothing to do with the employers' leader or with his activities in that capacity. The Committee continues to await the Government s observations on the matter and requests it once again to return Eduardo Gmez Sigala s farm to him without delay and to compensate him fully for all damages resulting from the confiscation of the farm by the authorities.
.Recommendation (k). The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the electronic mail communicated by the IOE was not sent by any government official or representative. As to the alleged financing of parallel organizations, favouritism towards EMPREVEN and  social production enterprises' and discrimination against private enterprises, the Government states that there has been no such discrimination against any employer s organization whatsoever. According to the Government, the allegation of a supposed financing of EMPREVEN is completely unfounded, since the document to which the allegation refers has to do with resources granted to social production enterprises that went through EMPREVEN in its capacity as administrator, as the document itself indicates, and there is no evidence whatsoever that the resources are for funding EMPREVEN itself..
.Recommendation (i). Regarding the alleged confiscation",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
165,"( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by employers' leaders Egildo Lujn, Vicente Brito, Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considered that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. The Committee requested the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay and to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requested the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that no reference to the alleged attack on the buildings owned by Carlos Sequera Ypez, the former President of FEDECAMARAS, has been found in any report by the authorities. The Committee also notes the Government s statement that all Venezuelan state acquisitions of property on grounds of public utility or social interests entitle their former owner to due payment of fair compensation, as provided for in article  of the Constitution; the established procedure in all such acquisitions is that there should be a conciliation stage for the parties to agree on a price for the property being acquired by the State and that, where no agreement as possible, the matter is submitted to a competent tribunal to set a fair price.
.The Committee regrets that the Government does not provide any information on the frank dialogue that it had requested it to enter into with the four employers' leaders concerned and, since the Government refers only in general terms to the procedure in cases of  rescue' without indicating whether the payment of fair compensation has been decided on, it must therefore reiterate its earlier recommendations. The Committee requests the Government once again to provide information on the subject, to engage in a frank dialogue with the interested parties and with FEDECAMARAS and to grant the interested parties fair compensation without delay.
.The Committee takes note of the allegations presented by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS regarding the composition of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s employers' delegation to the th Session of the International Labour Conference, in which the Federation s greater representativeness was challenged, as well as of the Government s reply. The Committee informs the complainants that the composition of delegations to the Conference is the responsibility of the Credentials Committee, which has repeatedly ruled in favour of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee will therefore not examine the allegation, though it notes that it raises an issue which confirms the relevance of the other allegations in this report.
.Recommendation (j) (social dialogue). The Committee takes note of the numerous allegations presented by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS regarding the Government s persistent rejection of consultation and social dialogue with the employers' and workers' representative organizations and its continuing disregard of the Committee s recommendations. The complainant organizations have linked the lack of dialogue and the legal steps taken by the authorities to a serious increase in unemployment, economic problems and the difficulty for enterprises to conduct their business and note that between  and  the number of private employers dropped by . per cent and that , employers closed down.
.The complainants, in their allegations, reiterate that, despite the keenness that FEDECAMARAS has demonstrated in recent months to promote genuine social dialogue and tripartite consultation in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, no such developments have taken place. In some cases the Government has merely convened at its own discretion specific private sectors other than FEDECAMARAS, which is widely recognized by the ILO as being the most representative employers' organization in the country; in others, the consultation is a mere formality that does not allow time to reply, or else the views of the independent social partners consulted are simply ignored. According to these allegations, on yet other occasions there has either been no consultation whatsoever or else it has been held just with a few hand-picked organizations that support the Government. The complainants allege that these incidents violate the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), and the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), all ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, The Committee observes that the complainants point out that, since January ,  legislative decrees on crucial issues have been issued without consulting the representative employers' organizations and without any citizens' participation or open consultation. According to the allegations, the decrees have harmed the economy and the functioning of private enterprises, which have faced discrimination and sanctions.
.Taking into account the problems relating to the presidential decrees, whose constitutionality the complainant organizations challenge as going beyond of the mandate and issues initially agreed to (deriving from a natural disaster caused by heavy rainfall), are set out in detail in the allegations. The Committee will therefore highlight here just some of the points alleged by the complainant organizations, namely: () the decree on security of employment was promulgated without any consultation for the eleventh year running and now applies to all workers except those at the management level, those in positions of trust, temporary and casual workers and public officials; the new Organic Labour Act (which, to be qualified as  organic' should have been approved by a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly) was drafted by a Presidential Committee of authorities and other persons linked to the Government (for instance, a representative of FEDEINDUSTRIA but not of FEDECAMARAS or of the workers' representative organizations). According to the allegations, the new Act places additional economic and political burdens on the private sector, introduces prison sentences other than for the administrators of state enterprises, provides for a damaging system of retroactivity of social benefits for seniority, institutes workers' councils alongside trade unions, requires trade unions to provide the Register with a list of their members and imposes its guidelines on them, etc.; moreover, the Act does away with the National Tripartite Committee on Minimum Wages; () the Organic Act on Community Management of Skills, Services and Other Attributes and the Act to Promote and Regulate New Forms of Association with the State are subject to government guidelines and are designed to promote or extend the socialist model by means of widespread centralization and state control of the economy, the granting of special advantages to entrepreneurial associations with the State and discrimination against other enterprises; () the Legislative Decree to Determine the Fair Price of Real Estate for Housing Purposes in Cases of Emergency is designed to minimize as far as possible the amount payable to the persons expropriated by ignoring the market value and violating the right to private ownership; () the new presidential decree on the minimum wage, according to the allegations, introduces the concept of objective criminal responsibility to renders enterprises responsible for the actions of their dependence and gives administrative officials powers of investigation; () the Costs and Fair Prices Act entails a long-drawn-out and laborious process that may be applied to any product at all so as to control the chain of production, marketing and distribution and so that the Department set up for the purpose can fix the maximum prices that it considers  fair'  and provides for sanctions such as temporary occupation; () the Penal Act on the Environment is contrary to the very structure of penal law based on subjective as opposed to objective responsibility.
.The Committee takes note that the Government confirms its previous replies and states that the complainants' allegations are not an extension of the complaint but a repetition. On this point the Committee wishes to point out that the new allegations refer to the lack of consultation on new presidential legislative decrees.
.In addition to the Government s statement that FEDECAMARAS is a civil association of entrepreneurs the activities of which are of a political nature, the Committee takes note of the Government s indication: () that all laws in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela are subject to broad consultation of the entire population and of social organizations; that some members of FEDECAMARAS are deputies in the National Assembly, where the great majority of the laws are discussed; that the population was also consulted on the laws approved by the President of the Republic under an Enabling Act adopted by the National Assembly; and that the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela provides for a referendum to revoke any laws that are approved without the requisite support of the population; () that FEDECAMARAS chose not to take part in many of the consultations and restricted the expression of its views to outright rejection in statements it made to the media, often before the Act was published in the belief that the Federation could prevent it from being approved; FEDECAMARAS s attitude of opposing any form of consultation and then saying that it has not been invited to take part has been its strategy since ",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
166,"when the people of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela rose against a Government backed by the Tripartite Committee, which without any consultation had amended labour laws and trespassed on the historical rights of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela s working class; the dominant employers' organizations in the country take part in all consultations on legislation, in most cases with the exception of FEDECAMARAS for strictly political reasons; () that any mention of the Tripartite Committee of those years (from  to , the minimum wage was raised only twice) brings back painful memories for the Venezuelan people and is associated with the infringement of workers' and human rights and the coup d at of ; that that is why the Constitution and other laws refer to a broad social dialogue which transcends so-called tripartite dialogue that is restricted to an elite divorced from the country s social movements, as all the social actors are involved in every decision through their organizations or directly through assemblies; () that, as to the allegations regarding presidential decrees issued under the Enabling Act, the Committee should not allow government bodies to be discredited without a proper reason for doing so; and () the Government receives and analyses the views and recommendations of social and economic organizations with respect to the minimum wage.
.Regarding the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Bill calling on the Government to ensure respect for the principles governing international financial assistance to workers' and employers' organizations (so that, if the Bill does indeed apply to them, it can take the necessary measures without delay to amend the Bill (or the Act) and thus guarantee explicitly the rights of employers' and workers' organizations to receive international financial assistance for activities involving the promotion and defence of the rights of their members), the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that it is not in the spirit of the Act to prevent any organization from receiving funding to promote and defend its members since, if that were so, there would be no reason to conceal the source of the funds and how they were used  to promote the interests of their members'  according to the Government, the object of the Bill is to prevent the financing of the political or, worse, clandestine activities of certain organizations to the detriment of others, in a discriminatory and exclusive manner that is designed to favour some options over others. The Committee notes the Government s statement that it will take the ILO s observations into account in drafting the future Act. The Committee hopes to be able to note progress once the legislation has been adopted.
.The Committee also takes note of the following statements by the Government:()	The purpose of the Security of Employment Decree is to protect workers' rights as a fundamental means of promoting the welfare of the people and the construction of a just and peace-loving society, to guarantee workers' security of employment and to protect them from employers who use unjustified dismissal as a means of punishing them for their political, class-conscious and revolutionary views.()	As to the new Organic Labour and Workers Act, the workers participated in a committee composed of representatives of all sectors ' workers, peasants, employers, the Government, the Judiciary and the Legislature ' with the single objective of presenting a Bill that would reflect the will of the people, be an expression of community interests and respect the intangible and progressive nature of workers' rights under the Constitution; the new Act is a synthesis of  years of National Assembly meetings with various sectors, and in the six months preceding the law s promulgation over , proposals were submitted directly to the committee to be studied and debated publicly; this was a national and constructive debate, a direct dialogue with the workers; according to the Government, the Act consolidates the fundamental rights of workers, does away with child labour, prohibits outsourcing, shortens the working week to  hours, guarantees employment security for all workers, grants equal workers' rights to domestic workers and consolidates a social security system whose coverage includes non-dependent workers and which recognizes women s work as homemakers; it requires enterprises to provide traineeships and apprenticeships to stimulate youth employment and reclaims the fundamental rights and historic struggles of the working class that were denied by capitalism and unbridled globalization.()	The purpose of the Costs and Fair Prices Act is to regulate, administer, monitor and control prices in order to put an end to speculation and hoarding, which is the main cause of inflation in Venezuela; a study was first carried out of production processes, transport and storage in order to ensure that enterprises would not lose money in manufacturing their products but that they would not speculate on the needs of the people, either; the Act introduces prior control mechanisms for enterprises whose profits are excessive in terms of the cost structure of the goods they produce or market or the services they provide; it identifies economic agents who demand excessive prices for the services or products they offer; it establishes exchange criteria that are fair; it provides the means of obtaining information on technical criteria for following up consumers' complaints of speculation and other irregular practices that hamper their access to goods and services, etc.()	The Penal Act on the Environment is crucial to Venezuela s compliance with international agreements and to the life-giving environment itself; it introduces the concept of objective penal responsibility for environmental crimes as well as an administrative standard whereby responsibility is determined by proof of an infringement of the law, not by proof of culpability; it renders juridical persons responsible for their actions or omissions if the crime entails the violation of standards or rules contained in administrative or legislative provisions; juridical persons are held jointly and severally responsible if they enter into an agreement whereby one carries out a specific piece of work for the benefit of or for use by the other and whose implementation results in risks or damage to the environment or to natural resources; investigation officers identified by the Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigation Department and in special laws and the regulations made under them are empowered inter alia to conduct criminal investigations into environmental crimes; the Act provides for the preservation and protection of the country s natural resources and for the welfare of the population; the Government explicitly requests the Committee to explain what the allegations regarding the Act have to do with its mandate. The Committee informs the Government that the complainant organizations allege that FEDECAMARAS was not consulted, that the absence of consultation on this and other laws is discriminatory and that, from its standpoint, its wording is unfair and prejudicial.
.The Committee wishes to point out that it is not called upon to rule on the substance of laws and legislative decrees that the complainant organizations claim have been adopted without FEDECAMARAS being consulted, even though it is the most representative employers' organization, unless they contain provisions that constitute a violation of workers' and employers' trade union rights, discrimination between organizations or favouritism vis--vis certain organizations or have been drafted without any tripartite consultation. That said, the Committee emphasizes that the substance of the laws and decrees under examination do affect the interests of employers' organizations and that the Government has not sent it a timetable of consultations with FEDECAMARAS on the numerous laws and presidential decrees adopted in recent years and it therefore does not consider the argument concerning FEDECAMARAS' so-called self-exclusion from the consultation process to be justified. Moreover, the Committee regrets that the National Tripartite Committee on Minimum Wages has not been maintained in the new Organic Labour Act on the grounds that its functioning and the  coup d at were reprehensible in the s. The Committee concludes that social dialogue with employers' organizations has continued to deteriorate, especially as a result of enabling acts that give rise to the issuance of new presidential decrees without FEDECAMARAS being involved even though the affect the Federation s interests and are adopted independently of the Parliament. The Committee is examining this matter, along with a number of provisions contained in the Organic Labour and Workers Act in this report, in the context of another case (Case No. ).
.The Committee wishes to draw the Government s attention to the fact that it has on many occasions emphasized the importance that should be attached to full, frank, comprehensive, detailed and unfettered consultation taking place with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations on matters of common interest, including matters relating to working conditions and any legislation or measure relating to those conditions, as well as any draft labour legislation. The Committee has repeatedly stressed that the parties concerned must make a sufficient effort to reach, as far as possible, solutions that are acceptable to all. It has also drawn attention to the importance that consultations take place in good faith and mutual trust and respect and that the parties",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
167,"have sufficient time to express their views and discuss them in full with a view to reaching a suitable compromise [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras ' ; see also, for example, the th Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), para. ].
.That being so, and observing the grave shortcomings in matters of social dialogue ' especially with FEDECAMARAS ' and its deterioration in recent years, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendations as follows:' Deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard.' The Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, with a tripartite composition that duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests the Government once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act.' Observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subjected to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible.' The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various branches of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws that affect the interests of the employers and their organizations.' The Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employers' interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has once again ignored these recommendation despite the fact that the Committee has been insisting on them for years.
.With regard to its earlier recommendations (g), (h) and (m) requesting the complainant organizations for information on the Planning Commission Act, the allegations regarding the livestock farmer Franklin Brito and the expropriation of Agroislea SA, Owen ' Illinois and the Orinoco steel plant, the Committee observes that the Government points out that the requested information has not been received and, invoking the principle of consistency with other cases, requests the Committee to consider that it has concluded its examination of the allegations. The Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations any further.
.Finally, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the High-level Tripartite Mission approved in March , which the Government agreed could look into the issues that were still pending with regard to Case No. , has twice been postponed for reasons outside the Government s control. The Committee is strongly of the view that the Mission should take place in the near future and requests the Office to contact the Government to that effect. The Committee considers that the Mission should be able to make a contribution to resolving the problems raised.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Regarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee ' which had taken note that two of the suspects had been arrested ' deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee notes the Government s statements on developments in the proceedings and expresses the hope that the perpetrators of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in a manner commensurate with the seriousness of the offences so that such incidents are not repeated, and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. At the same time, the Committee notes that the Government s observations are not conducive to dissipating the concern it had expressed in its previous examination of the case (according to the IOE the employers leader Albis Muoz asserted that neither of the suspects arrested by the Government (Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression).(b)	Regarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state once again that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. The Committee requests the Government to send it the decisions handed down by the authorities (Office of the Public Prosecutor, the judicial authority) in this case.(c)	Regarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , concerning which the Government had stated that the persons charged (Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos) confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, the Committee notes the information sent by the Government on these developments in the criminal proceedings. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties be punished in a manner commensurate with the seriousness of the crimes committed and that the employer s organization be compensated for the losses and damages sustained as a result of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(d)	Observing the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS and its officials, the Committee once again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(e)	Regarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to employers' leader Eduardo Gmez Sigala and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s reply to the effect that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee looks forward to receiving the information that the Government says it will send and again calls on it to return the farm without delay to the employers' leader and to compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the authorities' seizure of his farm.(f)	Regarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders Egildo Lujn, Vicente Brito, Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination and once again requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay, to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the payment of compensation has been decided.(g)	Regarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue and of consultations with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without tripartite consultation of numerous presidential legislative decrees and laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. Observing that serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist and have even grown, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
168,"its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government, with the assistance of the ILO, to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country to examine every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges it to keep the Committee informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with ILO principles, with a tripartite composition that duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations.

The Committee is strongly of the view that the Mission should take place in the near future and requests the Office to contact the Government to that effect. The Committee considers that the Mission should be able to make a contribution to resolving the problems raised.(i)	The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of the matters dealt with in this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.Subsequently, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) sent new allegations and additional information in communications dated  February and  June  and  February . The Government sent new observations in communications dated  February and  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:With regard to the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee notes that the Government states that there is no complaint pending with the Public Prosecutor s Office and the representatives of FEDECAMARAS have not filed any complaint. The Committee deplores, whether or not there had been a complaint by representatives of FEDECAMARAS within the country, that the Government has ignored its recommendation to step up the investigations into these attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in May and November . The Committee requests FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint concerning the alleged facts of the attacks on its headquarters in  with the Public Prosecutor s Office and hopes that the authorities will collaborate with the organization s representatives to clarify the facts, identify and convict the guilty persons.As regards the allegation concerning the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee firmly hopes that the authors of the bomb attack at FEDECAMARAS headquarters will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.The Committee deplores the lack of observations on the alleged abduction of  agricultural and livestock farmers and the death of one farmer (Mr Franklin Brito) as a result of going on a succession of hunger strikes in protest against the Government for the unjust invasion and expropriation of his land. The Committee emphasizes the seriousness of these allegations, requests the Government to reply to them without delay, and to make every effort to secure the release of the  abducted agricultural and livestock farmers and should order investigations to be carried out to punish the guilty persons. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.In general, taking into account the series of allegations examined in this section, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .With respect to the allegations of intimidation and harassment of FEDECAMARAS and its leaders, including the invasion and expropriation of farms or companies (in many cases without payment of due compensation) to the detriment of leaders or members of FEDECAMARAS, criminal prosecutions of employers' leaders and verbal attacks by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and its leaders, the Committee deplores that the Government has not replied to these allegations and requests it to send detailed observations without delay. The Committee reiterates the principle expressed in the previous paragraph and expresses the firm hope that in the future the authorities will refrain from adopting such an aggressive tone in their statements concerning FEDECAMARAS and its leaders and members, and that these allegations of unjust invasions, expropriations and prosecutions should be investigated.The Committee deplores that the Government has not explained in detail the circumstances of the specific events which resulted in the criminal charge and trial of employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and requests it to do so and to keep it informed of developments in the trial. The Committee once again requests the Government to return the  La Bureche' farm property to the employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala without delay and to compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm....The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations concerning social dialogue:deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
169,"Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.The Committee requests the Government to indicate the means of recourse available to employers who feel that they are victims of discrimination involving refusal to issue a labour solvency certificate or official foreign exchange authorizations, to initiate a dialogue with FEDECAMARAS on these questions and to inform the Committee of developments.The Committee observes with regret that the Government has not replied to the allegations of discrimination against FEDECAMARAS and its members concerning parallel bodies and organizations close to the Government. The Committee requests the Government to send without delay its observations on these allegations and wishes to emphasize that by favouring or disadvantaging certain organizations compared with the rest, governments can influence the attitude of workers or employers when they choose which organization they wish to join, which is incompatible with the principle contained in Convention No.  whereby public authorities must refrain from any interference which would restrict the rights enshrined in the Convention. The Committee therefore requests the Government to ensure equal treatment for all employers' organizations in the matter of financing of activities and not to discriminate against members of FEDECAMARAS.With regard to the examination of the international cooperation bill, the Committee hopes that it will provide for rapid recourse in the cases of discrimination and that it will avoid interference by the authorities in access to foreign funds by workers' and employers' organizations.The Committee notes the comments of the complainant organization concerning the Organic Act establishing the Central Planning Commission. In this respect, while the legislation establishes strong state intervention in the economy and national economic structure under the aegis of central planning in order to construct the Venezuelan socialist model, the Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide information on the relationship between the allegations and the violation of Conventions Nos  and .The Committee notes the additional information sent by the IOE on  February  concerning the cases of confiscation of property of employers' leaders, the alleged physical attacks against employers' leaders, the lack of social dialogue, as well as other questions, and the Government s communication, dated  February , received two days before the Committee s meeting. The Committee will review these communications when it will next examine this case.The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to this case because of the extreme seriousness and urgency of the matters dealt with therein.
.In its communication dated  February , the IOE alleges that, despite the fact that the Committee on Freedom of Association has drawn the Governing Body s attention to the  extreme seriousness and urgency' of this case, the Government continues to ignore the recommendations made by the Committee at its March  meeting, as well as subsequent recommendations.
.The IOE alleges that, as it reported in its previous complaint, representatives of employers' organizations, and the private sector in general, are constantly harassed and threatened because of their efforts to defend their members. The IOE provides the following concrete examples of the confiscation of farms belonging to employer leaders of FEDENAGA and the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers and Association of Commerce and Production (FEDECAMARAS) by the government authorities, in violation of the Constitution and of ILO Convention No. :Employers' leaderEgildo Lujn, Director of FEDECAMARAS, Livestock Sector, Vice-President of FEDENAGAFarmLa Escondida, State of BarinasNumber of hectares.

.The IOE further states that, according to Roberto Orta Martnez, President of the Association of Urban Building Owners, the Government, in pursuit of its anti-private property policy, has expropriated a total of  urban buildings, for which it has paid compensation in only  per cent of the cases.
.The IOE alleges that, in addition to the attacks mentioned in the information it presented on  November , the Public Prosecutor s Office embarked on a new criminal investigation on  December  to ascertain whether,",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
170,"in his statement of  December , the President of FEDECAMARAS, Noel lvarez, committed a crime by calling on the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB) to respect the Constitution and not to accept any orders that they judged might violate the Constitution or any other law.
.In his statement the President of FEDECAMARAS asked the members of the FANB to read article  of the Constitution:  Any act on the part of the public authority that violates or encroaches upon the rights guaranteed by this Constitution and by law is null and void, and public employees ordering or implementing such an act shall incur criminal, civil and administrative liability, as applicable, without the excuse of having followed the orders of a superior' and declared:  I appeal to them to exercise their freedom of conscience by refusing to carry out any order which they deem to be a violation of the Constitution.' He made this recommendation on the occasion of the military occupation of  productive private properties in the Sur del Lago region in the State of Zulia.
.President Chvez declared on  December  that the FEDECAMARAS President s appeal to military personnel to respect the Constitution and the law was a  call to war' and expressed the view that it was a  statement that bordered on the criminal' 
.Despite these threats, Mr Noel lvarez said that he would remain in the country to face all the accusations against him and insisted that he was not guilty of any crime since he had at no time called on anyone not to respect the Constitution but rather to respect it.
.The IOE refers to its allegations concerning events on the night of  October , when in Caracas a group of armed and masked men machine-gunned, kidnapped and maltreated the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the former President, Ms Albis Muoz, the Executive Director, Mr Luis Villegas, and the Treasurer, Mr Ernesto Villamil. The kidnappers also injured Ms Albis Muoz, Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO, shooting her three times.
.According to the Venezuelan authorities, two suspects in the kidnapping were arrested in November . The Director of the Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigations Body declared that the motive behind the aggression was vehicle theft, but he was unable to explain why the victims had been held for about two hours or why Ms Albis Muoz, a former President of FEDECAMARAS and Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO, had been shot three times. Ms Albis Muoz stated that neither of the suspects had been the instigators of the aggression.
.Furthermore, although the names of the people and institutions behind the numerous attacks on FEDECAMARAS are known and despite the Government s public assurances before the Conference and Governing Body of the ILO, as well as the numerous recommendations made by the ILO s supervisory bodies, so far none of the attacks have led to the arrest and punishment of the guilty parties.
.In his statements on  December , the President of FEDECAMARAS criticized the attitude of the National Assembly at the end of  when in barely two weeks it adopted more laws than during the rest of the year, just before the government party on  January  lost the possibility of adopting organic laws with its votes alone.
.The President of FEDECAMARAS said that he rejected the legislative haste with which the National Assembly had within the previous few weeks adopted a series of laws that affected essential trade union rights of Venezuelan citizens and modified fundamental aspects of the country s economic system, without due consultation of the people as required by the Constitution.
.For its part the non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch described as  a legislative hold-up' the series of laws adopted by the Venezuelan Parliament in the last days of December , which in its opinion was an attack on freedom of expression and on human rights defence groups, especially the law regulating the content of the Internet and giving the State greater control over telecommunications and the law preventing the international financing of NGOs. The executive body of Human Rights Watch said that the Government would now be able to block Internet sites and penalize radio and television stations for encouraging people to join start a peaceful civil disobedience movement or merely for broadcasting news that made people  anxious' 
.On  December the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed its concern at the Venezuelan Government s proposal, in the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Bill, to control the financing of NGOs by international cooperation and to prevent the international financing of political parties. In the Commission s opinion, the ambiguous wording of certain clauses of the Bill and the broad discretion it conferred on the authorities carried a risk that it might be interpreted restrictively so as to limit the exercise of freedom of association, freedom of expression, political participation and equality.
.Despite the views expressed by the Inter-American Commission and by several civil society institutions, and at the solemn request of President Chvez, the National Assembly urgently examined a new draft of the Bill in December . On the night of  December , at its second reading, the National Assembly approved the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Act, which contains ten articles and, inter alia, prevents Venezuelan employers' and workers' organizations from receiving any kind of international financial assistance without prior authorization.
.Article  of the Act stipulates that the assets and other income of politically motivated or political rights defence organizations must derive exclusively from  national assets and resources'  The Government of Venezuela considers that employers' and workers' organizations come under this head and has accused them of receiving  thousands of dollars from North American imperialism, not just to defend human rights but to promote conspiracies and coups d at' 
.On  December  the National Assembly approved at its second reading the Communal Economic System Organic Act, which introduces a communal currency unsupported by the Central Bank of Venezuela as an alternative legal tender. The Act provides that socio-productive organizations other than private sector organizations may benefit directly or indirectly from various financial and non-financial resources. Similarly, the Act provides that the Executive must encourage the use of goods and services created nationally and internationally under the Communal Economic System. Article  stipulates that  natural or juridical persons that together or separately engage in propaganda or subliminal, false or deceitful publicity regarding the goods, services and know-how of the Communal Economic System and its means of production, trade, distribution, marketing and supply shall be liable to imprisonment for two to four years'  Once again, attention is drawn to the fact that the vagueness of the terms used give reason to fear a broad interpretation that could result in the violation of freedom of expression or of any right of opinion voiced by the private sector.
.The new Enabling Act adopted by the National Assembly at the end of December  constitutes yet another concession of powers to President Chvez so that he can govern by decree with the status, weight and force of law in nine additional areas: tending to vital needs resulting from the rains, infrastructure, transport and public services, housing and environment, land-use management and the integrated development and use of urban and rural land, finance and taxation, public safety and legal security, integrated security and defence, and international cooperation and the economic system. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has consequently voiced its concern that the Act gravely undermines the principles of separation of powers and freedom of expression. It should be borne in mind that President Chvez has already benefited from three special Enabling Acts in ,  and  under which he passed more than  laws.
.On  January  the Land and Housing Emergency Act was promulgated under this new Enabling Act, i.e. without tripartite consultation. The Act authorizes  urban land and non-residential buildings (storehouses, warehouses, industrial plants) that are idle, abandoned or improperly employed to be declared of public utility and expropriated'  and empowers President Chvez to decree emergency areas and vital housing and residential areas. The new Act provides for fast-track expropriation machinery that offers owners no guarantees since there is no provision for compensation. As was stressed by the President of the Real Estate Chamber of Venezuela, Mr Aquiles Martini, the  discretion' left to the Executive to determine that land is idle or improperly employed raises questions as to the criteria used.
.The IOE and FEDECAMARAS regret to have to refer once again to the lack of social dialogue and bipartite and tripartite consultation, despite the fact that the Committee on Freedom of Association has repeatedly emphasized  the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation'  Despite the Committee s recommendations requesting the Government  to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
171,"issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations'  there has been no change in the Government s attitude and it continues to adopt reforms and laws affecting the private sector without any prior consultation or dialogue with the social partners.
.The IOE concludes by stating that the Government s totalitarian project based on intimidation restricts the exercise of civil liberties in defence of the individual and collective rights of employers. The constant harassment suffered by Venezuela s employers is endangering the very existence of independent employers' organizations, notably FEDECAMARAS and, of course, many of the country s economic sectors.
.In its communication dated  June , the IOE recalls that for eight years it has complained to the Committee on Freedom of Association about the Venezuelan Government s constant harassment of the private sector and of FEDECAMARAS, its most representative organization. It adds that, along with its complaint, the IOE recently expressed its grave concern regarding information that it has sent the Committee, which clearly proves the lack of independence of, and government interference in, the affairs of parallel employer' organizations it has set up, towards which it has showed favouritism and which for the past five years it has systematically designated as the employers' delegation to the International Labour Conference. The IOE has decided to forward the that information so that it can be placed before the Committee on Freedom of Association and before the High-level Mission that is scheduled to visit Caracas to examine the complaints of the Venezuelan Government s non-compliance with Convention No. . The information is as follows:' On  May  the Director of International Relations of the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour sent an email to the EMPREVEN, Confagan, Fedeindustrias and Coboien organizations containing models of letters for them to send the ILO and IOE in defence of its case at the  Session of the Conference and to establish closer relations with the IOE itself.' On  May  a representative of the Venezuelan Government to the ILO and labour attach of its Permanent Mission in Geneva wrote to the aforementioned Director of International Relations with instructions and suggestions regarding EMPREVEN, Confagan, Fedeindustrias and Coboien s communications to the IOE and the ILO s Conference Credential Committee, as follows:The IOE points out that the details contained in the email and the justification given for sending it are clear proof of the Government s interference in these organizations and of their utter subjection to the Venezuelan authorities.Note: I suggest that each of the employers' organizations send a letter individually, along the following lines:.	Wait until all the Conference Committees have been set up on the first day of the th Session and then, after having endeavoured to establish their credentials as employers' representatives on the committees, specify clearly in a letter the names of the committees on which they have been prevented from establishing their credentials by the FEDECAMARAS representatives, and have the letter registered;.	Introduce the document in broad and general terms as drafted, and then present a more detailed additional text themselves describing the action taken in each of the committees at the th Session of the Conference.Both methods are valid, and I believe they will oblige the Credentials Committee to recognize the situation and issue a reply.I suggest deleting the passages highlighted in red.Regarding the suggestions, I would emphasize that we must avoid describing the written document as a complaint since, from the legal standpoint under article  of the Rules for the Conference, it might not strictly speaking fit any of the hypotheses contemplated or may otherwise be deemed irreceivable at the outset by the Credentials Committee by virtue of clause (c) of said article .
.Finally, the IOE has sent a copy of one of the letters that it received from EMPREVEN, containing word for word the Ministry of Labour s draft text, along with all the recommendations by the Venezuelan Government s official representative to the ILO. The IOE encloses copies of the emails cited in its allegations and considers that this information proves formally the total dependency of the Government organizations concerned and their lack of credibility within the ILO.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government refers to the communications sent by the IOE on  November  and  February , containing details of the amplification of their complaint against the Government.
.The Government respectfully requests the Committee on Freedom of Association to carry out a detailed examination of the so-called extension of the IOE s complaint, bearing in mind that an  amplification' presupposes the presentation of new allegations, of new facts, whereas the communications sent by the IOE contain the same allegations set out previously in the complaint and already answered in detail by the present representatives of the Government. Moreover, the communication dated  February  contains virtually the same arguments as that of  November .
.This situation merely distracts the Government s attention, and the Committee s too, from the matter at hand, and the Government therefore insists that the Committee confine its considerations strictly to its request for the Government s observations on new allegations or new information, since it has repeatedly answered in ample detail all the allegations in this case, irrespective of the fact that the Committee has expressed little satisfaction in that regard.
.The Government also wishes to draw attention to the powers and attributes assumed by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its examination of this case. Before the Committee examines the case further in March, the Government would like to refer to an ILO publication, The Committee on Freedom of Association: Its impact over  years by Eric Gravel, Isabelle Duplessis and Bernard Gernigon, which states with regard to the examination of complaints that are of a political nature:  Even though cases may be political in origin or present certain political aspects, they should be examined by the Committee if they raise questions concerning the exercise of trade union rights. It is for the Committee to rule on this issue after examining all the available information, in the same way as it rules on the question of whether the issues raised in a complaint concern penal law or the exercise of trade union rights.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.Many of the allegations in this case are beyond the purview of freedom of association and collective bargaining and concern political or purely economic issues. Elsewhere, they are beyond the purview of freedom of association and collective bargaining and have to do with penal law, specifically in the case of Mr Carlos Fernndez. Before the Committee considers some of the allegations in this case and expresses its opinions and recommendations, it should determine whether they have anything to do with trade union rights, in other words whether or not the Committee is competent to examine them. The Government also wonders whether the recommendations made by the Committee, such as those advocating the impunity of certain workers' and employers' union leaders who have committed serious crimes against the people of Venezuela, are actually within its powers, come within its mandate or concern its very raison d tre.
.Finally, regarding practically all the allegations presented by the complainants, the Government is dismayed and concerned at the Committee s failure to lend any credit to the arguments, replies and evidence it has advanced, and at the Committee s readiness to believe the allegations and asseverations of the complainants, even though most of them are baseless. Nevertheless, as a token of its good will towards this international body and in the renewed hope that its reply will be treated with the objectivity that any Member of the ILO expects, the Government hereby responds to some of the points raised by the IOE.
.The Government wishes to point out once again that the land rescue project being carried out by the National Land Institute (INTI) is not about confiscating, occupying or raiding the property of union representatives or private employers. On the contrary, the process involves land that is lying idle, unproductive or being used illegally, in accordance with the Constitution and the Land and Agrarian Development Act.
.To start with, reference must be made to the land rescue process as it is laid down in Chapter VII of the said Act.
.Article  of the Act states that INTI is empowered to reclaim ownership of land that is illegally or unlawfully occupied, in which case, acting on its own initiative or following a complaint, it embarks upon the appropriate reclamation procedure subject to the guarantees provided for in articles ,  and  of the Act.
.Article  stipulates that land rescue does not apply to agricultural land that is fully productive and in full compliance with the plans and guidelines laid down by the Executive.
.Consequently, once the process in engaged, INTI can take over reclaimable land designated as idle or uncultivated in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
.The Bolivarian Republic of",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
172,"Venezuela, like many countries throughout the world, is using the agrarian sector to strengthen and extend the values of social development embodied in the Constitution. In this way it hopes to bring about a just and equitable distribution of wealth along with the strategic, democratic and participative planning of land ownership and the development of the agrarian sector as a whole.
.The Government notes that it has provided the necessary means and machinery to do away entirely with the latifundista system (under which vast tracts of land are privately owned) as being contrary to justice, equity, equality, the public interest and social peace. Specifically, one of the fundamental principles underlying the adoption of the Land and Agrarian Development Act is to ensure the security and sovereignty of the country s agro food sector for the benefit of the entire population.
.It is important to refer here to the following pronouncements of this worthy Organization on the subject of agrarian reform, affirmations which we trust are still valid today:' The ILO s Tenants and Share-croppers Recommendation,  (No. ) of the ILO states that,  in conformity with the general principle that agricultural workers of all categories should have access to land, measures should be taken, where appropriate to economic and social development, to facilitate the access of tenants, share-croppers and similar categories of agricultural workers to land. ?Similarly, the Rural Workers' Organisations Recommendation,  (No. ) recognizes that  land reform is in many developing countries an essential factor in the improvement of the conditions of work and life of rural workers and that organizations of such workers should accordingly cooperate and participate actively in the implementation of such reform' ' An ILO press release along the same line issued on  December  (OIT//) on boosting agricultural productivity stated:  Most SSA countries are primarily rural and the agricultural economy requires a number of basic changes. The first major requirement is to abandon the age-old system whereby governments impose artificially low prices for staples such as bread and rice, a practice which feeds urban dwellers but keeps farmers in poverty. A second requirement is to diversify production away from large-scale commodity production to areas of greater export potential, such as cut flowers, tropical fruits and vegetables. A third major requirement is land reform. Land is the primary resource in rural SSA and access to land is highly restricted. Ownership is often concentrated in the hands of large proprietors, who often make very poor use of their holdings, either leaving them idle or holding them for speculative purposes, whereas it is well documented that small land holders absorb more labour per acre and are more productive.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In the case of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, agrarian productivity has become a juridical concept that serves as a means of measuring the compatibility of privately-owned land with its social function. Thus, there are three level of productivity: idle or uncultivated farmland, farmland where there is room for improvement, and productive farmland. The first level corresponds to land that does not meet minimum production requirements and is therefore subject to occupation or expropriation. The second is land which, while not productive, can be made so in a relatively short period of time and where the owner is encouraged to adapt accordingly and is offered financial assistance. The third level refers to land that is properly managed and productive.
.In most cases where land has been reclaimed by the State for the public good, the existing occupants were unable to prove ownership, as they only had dubious deeds or no deeds at all; in many cases the land did not meet production requirements or was simply unproductive or idle. Nevertheless, the Government, through the appropriate channels, complied with established legal procedures and, in those cases, duly compensated the owners for any improvements they may have made. This shows that Venezuela s policy of complying with the requirements of social justice embodied in the Constitution and in international declarations has in its procedures and execution respected all relevant guarantees, rights and advantages.
.The Committee has already been informed that the law has duly empowered INTI, which is attached to the Ministry of Popular Power for Agriculture and Land, to proceed with the procedure for reclaiming the piece of land known as  Hacienda La Bureche'  Cabudare Parish, Palavecino Municipality, in the State of Lara, essentially to promote the agricultural use of the Ro Turbio valley by the immediate revitalization of this otherwise idle piece of land. The entire procedure complied with the relevant provisions of the Constitution, the Land and Agrarian Development Act and Decree No.  of  December  (see Official Gazette No. ,  December ).
.The inspection of the farm that was carried out showed clearly that it was underutilized, as it was being used for crops that were not suited to the type of soil and therefore engendering a process of deterioration. The system of management, too, was inappropriate and was thus having a negative impact on the environment that resulted in a total of  hectares being left idle on a farm measuring . hectares in all (not  hectares as the IOE states in its communication of  February ).
.Furthermore, regard the situation of Mr ngel Eduardo Gmez Sigala, he was caught in flagrante delicto and charged by the Public Prosecutor with resisting the authorities and causing light personal injuries (articles  and  of the Penal Code, respectively), following his assault on a military officer who among other things suffered a dislocated arm. At the time the officer and others with him were carrying out their duties accompanying INTI officials and maintaining public order.
.On  September  the Criminal Assizes of the State of Lara issued a restraining order, pursuant to article . of the Criminal Code of Procedure. Mr Gmez Sigala has since been released from custody and all his constitutional rights and guarantees have been respected. He has in fact been elected as a member of the National Assembly for the State of Lara, where he represents the COPEI political party and is currently serving as a Member of Parliament.
.The legal proceedings against Mr Gmez Sigala were surrounded by all the procedural guarantees laid down in national and international rules and regulations, and it is therefore unlikely that the courts would withdraw the charges brought against him or that the investigation into the matter be dropped, since the security and judicial bodies involved were merely carrying out their business in strict compliance with Venezuela s juridical rules and regulations.
.With regard to the events of  February , the IOE states in its communication of November  that, although a complaint was lodged on  February  with the Public Prosecutor s Office requesting  the most comprehensive and exhaustive investigation into the events and the identification of those responsible'  to date no result has been achieved.
.Since the IOE claims that on to date no result has been achieved, the Government reiterates what it has already told the Committee about this incident, namely, that the investigation was carried out by the appropriate bodies, that criminal charges were brought against Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Ms Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, and that their arrest was ordered by the courts in , whereupon they were declared fugitives from justice.
.The Government also stated before that the suspects, Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, were arrested on  and  May  for their alleged involvement in the incidents that occurred at FEDECAMARAS headquarters and are currently being held at the detention centre in the metropolitan area of Caracas.
.That being so, it can hardly be claimed that no result has been achieved, since on the contrary the State, through the appropriate bodies, has undertaken all the relevant investigations and made every effort to catch the suspects as quickly as possible, in full compliance with the law and in the interests of the principles and values of the State.
.With regard to the abduction of  agricultural and livestock farmers alleged by the IOE in its communication of November , in which it refers to the Government s irresponsible attitude in not doing anything to have them released, the Government, given the limited and inadequate information and evidence presented, asks the Committee to request that the complainants supply the necessary information so as to establish exactly what incidents and which persons the IOE is referring to.
.Here again it is clear that Venezuela enjoys complete freedom of association and the right to establish organizations in conformity with the Constitution, other laws and ILO Conventions on the subject. Both employers' and workers' organizations are free to form associations without any interference whatsoever. Under no circumstances does the Government encourage or become involved in the establishment or activities of such organizations, let alone show any favouritism or exercise any influence vis--vis one or the other.
.The juridical basis for the Foreign Currency Administration Commission (CADIVI) can be found in Decree No. , published in",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
173,"Official Gazette No.  on Thursday  February . Article  of the Decree states that labour solvency refers to an administrative document issued by the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour and Social Security (MINPPTRASS) certifying that employers respect in full the labour and trade union rights of their workers, which is an essential requirement for concluding contracts, agreements and conventions with the State. The document can be obtained rapidly and automatically through the Ministry s web site at http://www.mintra.gob.ve, where users have access to requirements and other information concerning their request. Employers must register with the National Registry of Enterprises and Establishments on the corresponding web page, for which purpose they are required to submit a number of document concerning the enterprise. Once the request has been submitted and the requisite formalities have been completed, a mere five working days are needed for the Ministry to handle the request, through the appropriate channels. Employers may then collect the solvency certificate from the Labour Inspectorate. As to the procedure, article  of Decree No.  stipulates that the Labour Inspectorate must refuse to issue or must revoke a solvency certificate if the employer concerned fails to comply with any MINPPTRASS resolution, refuses to comply properly with an administrative ruling, disobeys any injunction by a competent official, fails to meet the requirements of the Venezuelan Social Security Institute (IVSS) and the National Occupational Prevention, Safety and Health Institute (INPSASEL), fails to comply with a decision of the labour tribunals or infringes workers' freedom of association, the right to voluntary collective bargaining and the right to strike.
.As to resources, should an employer s application for labour solvency be denied, article  of Decree No.  stipulates as follows:  If proof of labour solvency is denied or revoked, the employer concerned may lodge an appeal as provided for in the Administrative Proceedings Act'  As can be seen from the above, the labour solvency procedure provides ample and sufficient guarantees of legality and impartiality for all applicants and entails formalities that are increasingly straightforward and rapid. In other words, the labour solvency procedure is designed not to hamper the economic development or commercial viability of enterprises in any way, let alone to restrict the production and marketing of goods and services. Its purpose is to guarantee the human and labour rights of workers which were all too often violated in the past.
.With regard to the procedure for obtaining foreign currency, the Government informs the Committee that the procedure is the same for all enterprises. It is a computerized process to which access may be had through the Government website http://www.cadtvtgob.ve, which contains all the necessary information and requirements for obtaining foreign currency without any discrimination whatsoever. Thanks to this method of administering foreign currency, it has been possible to cope with the fragility and volatility of currency markets and tackle the repercussions of the global crisis, without causing any negative impact on the level of employment or on workers' wages. Through this procedure CADIVI facilitates the obtention of foreign currency for basic consumer goods (medical supplies and food products) and essential imports. In other words, the State has opted to give priority to requests for foreign currency for the marketing of food products and medical supplies and, in general, for such goods as are considered vital for the wellbeing of the Venezuelan people under the system of centralized planning based on the prior determination of the needs of the population. Consequently, any enterprise that imports vital products or inputs that are necessary but not available in the country have priority for the issue of foreign currency. Similarly, Decree No.  or  June , published in Official Gazette No.  of  June , introduced another system for speeding up the acquisition of foreign currency for the importation of capital goods, inputs and raw materials for the country s production and processing sectors. This measure is specifically designed to dispense enterprises from certain CADIVI requirements if their request is for US$, or less in foreign currency and destined for the importation of capital goods, machinery, spare parts or production inputs. These administrative measures, which facilitate the acquisition of foreign currency as approved by the Government, help to boost the country s production system. (The Government enclosed CADIVI instructions Nos ,  and  and Decree No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the Government confirms its earlier replies, inasmuch as it has already dealt with many aspects of the new allegations presented by the IOE.
.The Government respectfully requests the Committee to review very carefully the additional material admitted as part of the complaint lodged by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS since, as already noted, they contain allegations to which the Government has already responded in sufficient detail.
.The Government again observes that the allegations set out by the complainants go beyond the terms of reference of the Committee on Freedom of Association and in many respects concern political and economic affairs and Venezuela s legal system. The Government therefore wishes once again to express its dismay on reviewing the Committee s recommendations, which explicitly request the Government  to revoke the warrant for the arrest of former FEDECAMARAS President Mr Carlos Fernndez, so that he may return to the country without risk of reprisals'  The Government wishes to remind the Committee that Mr Carlos Fernndez was involved in events that led to the breakdown of constitutional order in the country as a result of the coup d at that originated in the work stoppage by the employers and the petroleum strike of ' , events that severely disrupted the State of law, severely damaged the Venezuela s social fabric and caused the county serious economic hardship. It was for these reasons that Mr Carlos Fernndez was charged by the Public Prosecutor s Office, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country s Penal Code.
.The Government draws attention most forcefully to the wording used by the Committee, urging compliance with the law in some instances and in others requesting explicitly that legal process be denied. The Government therefore respectfully requests the Committee to reconsider the peremptory tone in which it expresses its recommendations, especially where they run counter to the country s laws and regulations.
.The Government likewise wishes to stress the principles enshrined in Venezuela s laws and regulations and recognized internationally, such as the presumption of good faith, the right to conduct one s defence and the impossibility for a party to know whether the Committee is at all concerned about a case that it is examining. For instance, the Committee refers to  the death of one farmer (Mr Franklin Brito) as a result of going on a succession of hunger strikes in protest against the Government for the unjust invasion and expropriation of his land'  where the allegations regarding Mr Franklin Brito are hard to reconcile with the arguments and wording employed by the Committee.
.In addition, the Government wishes to make known its displeasure at the way the amplifications adduced by the complainants were considered and given credence in assessing the evidence presented by the Government. The point has been made again and again that employers' and workers' organizations have full freedom of association under Venezuela s legislation and that the Government does not become involved in their establishment or in their activities. Government policy towards these sectors is in no way discriminatory or left to the discretion of the authorities. On social and labour affairs the Government holds regular consultations, meetings and discussions with the employers' and workers' organizations, including FEDECAMARAS, and it cannot be held accountable for the decision of a party not to take part in them.
.To begin with, the Government again denies the allegation that it attacked the former President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez. The allegations presented by the IOE in its communication of  February  state explicitly that it was part of a penal investigation by the Public Prosecutor s Office, which is in conformity with the law and mandate of the Judiciary and not of the Executive. At the th Session of the Governing Body in June , the Government representatives of Venezuela already rejected these unfounded claims presented by the Workers' group, as the minutes of the meeting show. Moreover, following that th Session and at the Office s request, the Government sent a detailed reply in communication No. / of  November , which was registered by the ILO s International Labour Standards Department on  November . In that communication the Government duly informed the ILO of the action taken, the investigations conducted and the proceedings engaged by Venezuela s State bodies in connection with the events involving Ms Albis Muoz, Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Mr Luis Villegas, former President and executive officers of FEDECAMARAS. On  December  the Public Prosecutor s Office accordingly charged Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Jason Manjares with the temporary abduction and attempted aggravated robbery",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
174,"of Ms Albis Muoz Maldonado. A preliminary hearing was set for  February  by the appropriate Supervisory Tribunal, which confirmed the charges and ordered that the accused stand trial on  October . As soon as a final ruling on the case has been handed down, the Committee will be duly informed.
.The Government states that on  June  formal criminal charges were brought of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers. The competent State bodies conducted the appropriate investigation, which resulted in charges being brought against Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Ms Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos and a warrant being issued for their arrest. A preliminary public hearing was held on  November . As soon as a final ruling on the case has been handed down, the Committee will be duly informed.
.In both cases the appropriate State bodies immediately carried out all the relevant investigations and made every effort to catch the accused as quickly as possible, in full compliance with the law and with the principles and values of the State.
.With regard to the alleged abduction of  agricultural and livestock farmers, the Government repeats the substance of communication No. / of  February , in which it requested details of the persons and events referred to in the complaint so that, if confirmed, it might order the appropriate investigations. It is still waiting for the complainant to submit that information, failing which the Government explicitly requests the Committee declare that, if the information is not forthcoming by its next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of the allegations and will therefore close the case. It is making this request so to ensure that the Committee s considerations are uniform, coherent and transparent in all the cases it is examining, just as it ruled on the absence of information from the Government in cases Nos  (paras  and ) and  (paras  and ) in its th report (document GB.//) adopted at the th Session of the Governing Body in June .
.With regard to Mr Franklin Brito, the State of Venezuela, through its institutions, guaranteed him the right to health as a fundamental social right and as a legal entitlement closely allied with the right to life, in full compliance with articles  and  of the Constitution and with the Constitution of the WHO, where it states:  Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity' and  The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.Faced with the Mr Franklin Brito s entirely personal decision not to take any food, and although the petition on which he based his decision was not contemplated by the legislation in force and there was no evidence or legal grounds to support his claims, the State guaranteed that his demands would be dealt with through administrative and jurisdictional channels. The following is a brief account of what happened:.	On  a Mr Franklin Brito engaged in an act of protest, sewing his mouth closed and declaring that he was on a hunger strike until he received a reply from various State bodies regarding an alleged failure to pay monies owing to him for work done and unjust decisions concerning land belonging to him. The Office of the Public Ombudsman reported that, having looked into the matter fully, it had found no written record of any complaint on the subject. Nevertheless, in order to protect Mr Franklin Brito s life, the Office, after carrying out all the relevant investigation, established that Mr Brito had not cashed the cheque in payment for his work and had said that he wanted a fixed-term appointment. Following the action taken by the Ombudsman, the Legal Advisory Division of the Ministry of Education and Sport reported that Mr Brito had given up his job as a supply teacher and that it could not keep the post open indefinitely, since by their very nature such posts were to meet a temporary shortage of staff and, when the appointee ceased to fill the post, it was automatically terminated.It should be borne in mind that under national law access to fixed-term appointments in the public service is possible only by a process of public examinations and interviews, as stipulated in article  of the Public Service Statutes Act..	As part of the land ownership and land use regularization process, Mr Franklin Brito was granted title to . hectares comprising the Yguaraya farm in the La Tigrera sector of the Municipality of Sucre in the State of Bolvar, by decision of the INTI board of directors (Session ., point .) on  May . In  Mr Rafael Gregorio D mico Baquero and Ms Concepcin de Jess Antoimas Fajardo were granted farming rights and title to pieces of land adjoining the Yguaraya farm, where they had been living since the end of .Mr Franklin Brito thereupon lodged a complaint against his neighbours for encroaching on part of his land. In  and , following Mr Brito s complaint, the boundaries in question were verified by the State of Bolvar branch of INTI, which established that there was no such encroachment and recommended that fences be built to delimit the property clearly. It also pointed out that Mr Brito must farm the land, as it was apparent from information obtained that the only productive use he made of it was to rent it out. INTI thus confirmed that Mr Brito owned the land that he had been granted in  and recorded the fact once again in the agrarian register.In  Mr Brito applied to the Second Court of First Instance for Commerce, Agriculture and Rights of Passage, which confirmed that there was no encroachment and declared his complaint irreceivable. The same day Mr Brito lodged another complaint with the Fifth Higher Agrarian Tribunal of the State of Monagas, which was likewise declared irreceivable on the grounds that there was no encroachment. In  Mr Brito appealed against the decision to the Constitutional Court of the Supreme Court of Justice, which ruled that his allegations of encroachment and trespassing were unfounded. When his appeal was denied, Mr Brito went back on hunger strike.For humanitarian reasons, even though it was fully aware of the absence of any encroachment as claimed by Mr Brito, the Government decided to award him compensation in the form of repairs, a tractor and the deforestation of  hectares of his land so that he could begin farming it. In spite of this, in  Mr Brito requested a large sum of money in compensation, which he was refused. Once again, Mr Brito resorted to a hunger strike to bring pressure to bear on the Government, this time in front of the headquarters of the Organization of American States (OAS).Representatives of a number of international bodies, such as the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in Venezuela (Alfredo Missair), the OAS, the International Red Cross (Mr Hernn Bongioanni), the International Red Crescent, the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization acknowledged the Venezuelan Government s willingness to engage in a transparent dialogue in an effort to save Mr Brito s life and protect his health, although certain national and international media clearly attempted to present a biased view of the situation and use him for anti Government political purposes.What is quite certain is that the Government did what it could to keep Mr Brito alive until his death from voluntary starvation, which was at no time directed against the Government.It is important to emphasize that the Government did everything it could to protect Mr Brito s physical integrity, to the extent that while he was still alive it obliged him to receive medical attention strictly to protect his health and life as a fundamental human right.The foregoing account contradicts the allegation of the IOE and FEDECAMARAS that the late Mr Brito s hunger strikes were  in protest against the Government for the unjust invasion and expropriation of his land'  which is totally false and just one of the tissue of lies concocted by the employers' organization to sully the good name and action of the Venezuelan Government.
.The Government states that it has repeatedly denied all the allegations presented by FEDECAMARAS and the IOE, all of which are quite baseless. The Government has always acted and continues to act in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. It emphasizes once again that the land rescue process embarked upon by the Government through INTI does not condone any confiscations, occupations or attacks on private property belonging to representatives of employers' organization or to private employers. On the contrary, the Ministry of Popular Power for Agriculture and Land, in the exercise of its mandate, has embarked upon the rescue and reclamation land",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
175,"suitable for growing vegetables and other strategic produce in order to maximize the soil s potential from the agrological standpoint. It has thus fostered the cultivation of broccoli, spring onions, leeks, coriander, parsley, lettuce, beetroot, tomatoes, chilli peppers and courgettes, which are considered to be strategic products of social interest, as a means of ensuring Venezuela s autonomy in agricultural foodstuffs, in order to prevent land from being left idle or unproductive or used unlawfully, in accordance with the Constitution and the Land and Agrarian Development Act. The ultimate objective is for the country to conform to the model of endogenous growth and social economy, based on the Simn Bolvar National Project ' , whereby the Government is pursuing social justice through the gradual inclusion of the least privileged segment of the population in the country s priority social and economic activities, as stipulated in the Constitution, while focussing on the needs of each sector, encouraging the gradual establishment of organized groups and respecting the right to work.
.Currently, the Government continues, the land available for agricultural and livestock production and for forestry has considerably diminished as the urban areas have grown and developed over during the past two decades, and this has rendered it necessary to encourage and maintain a minimum area of agricultural land to meet sectoral needs in the most vulnerable part of the country as part of a process of sustainable development. It is the duty of the State to foster conditions necessary for the development of a sustainable agriculture as the strategic basis of the country s integrated rural development, not just through legislation but by taking appropriate action to create employment and guarantee the rural population and small and medium-size producers an adequate standard of living, thanks to their participation in the production process through all kinds of community labour associations and collective ownership.
.The Government s action in respect of the cases listed below is based on the provisions of articles , , ,  and  of the Venezuelan Constitution, articles . and . to . of the Environment Act, article  of the Land-Use Management Act and articles , , '  and  of the Land and Agrarian Development Act:Case (identification of the farm concerned)Legal and technical grounds for State action, by farmSocial situation of farm employees at the time of the administrative actionLa Escondida, . hectares, State of Barinas, Rojas Municipality, San Hiplito sectorRescue procedure scheduled under articles '  of the Land and Agrarian Development Act and implemented by the National Land Institute (INTI) in . The soil is type II and III, excellent for vegetable growing; however, the land has in the past been used for livestock production, which is unsuited to this type of soil, which is classified worldwide as particularly fertile and ideal for agriculture. Consequently, in line with the political and strategic guidelines for self-sufficiency in agricultural foodstuffs, the land is currently destined for the development of primary production units and the production of strategic goods.Employees registered with the Venezuelan Social Security Institute (IVSS) and the Compulsory Savings Fund for Housing (FAOV) under employer no. .

The valley includes the aquifers that supply part of the drinking water for the population of Barquisimeto and Cabudare.The Government declared the area a special agricultural exploitation zone under Decree No.  of  December . Previously, Decree No.  of  established a land-use management scheme for the area with a view to the agricultural development of the Ro Turbio valley. The land showed no sign of productive activity, i.e. it is idle and unproductive. The soil is type I and IV, suitable for planting and ideal for agriculture, and is currently being developed by the Venezuelan Food Corporation (CVAL) for the production of strategic agricultural goods.There has always been a proper labour relationship, with holidays and end-of-year bonuses but the workers are not registered with the IVSS.

.The Government states that these cases have nothing whatsoever to do with the allegations contained in the complaint or with the complainants themselves, and it therefore invites the Committee once again to review very carefully the validity and receivability of allegations for inclusion in Case No. . Furthermore, the expropriation procedure provided for in national legislation is quite unrelated to the attacks and harassment aimed at the private sector, FEDECAMARAS and its leaders that they accuse the Government of. The Government repeats that the appropriation procedure is based on article . and  and article  of the Constitution, in accordance with article  of the Public or Social Utility Expropriation Act and article  of the Access to Goods and Services Defence Act. The Government is perfectly willing to provide the legal reasons for the said procedures, but the Committee would be in no position to discuss or oppose its decisions on the matter of public utility, let alone to query the Government s economic policy in taking such action.
.In strict compliance with the Constitution, the Government decreed the expropriation of the United States glass processing plant located in Venezuela, after establishing that the company had taken over  per cent of production in the sector and was therefore operating under an illegal monopoly that constituted a violation of the state of law and justice in the country, inasmuch as it ran counter to the principle of free competition provided for in the Constitution. In addition to combating a monopoly, the decision served to protect the environment, since the company had for over  years been damaging the mountain region of Los Guayos y Valera by extracting unlimited quantities of sand, carbonate and limestone for the manufacture of glass. At the same time, the Government guaranteed the labour rights of the employees, set up works' committees and respected fully the collective agreements covering the great majority of workers in the plants located in Valencia, State of Carabobo and in Valera, State of Trujillo. Moreover, the Government s decision strengthens the country s industrial sector thanks to the production of glass containers for food, drinks and medicines, etc., that are necessary for the development of the country and for the wellbeing of the people. The Government wishes to place on the record that in strict compliance with Venezuelan legislation, a legal process is to be initiated following publication of the decree on expropriation which will entail numerous meetings with the company s executives in a spirit of mutual respect and tranquillity and will result in the payment of a fair price.
.The Government has decreed the expropriation of the Turbio steel plant (Sidetur) located in",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
176,"the Punta Cuchillo sector of Ciudad Guayana, State of Bolvar, in strict compliance with constitutional principles. The company controlled  per cent of the steel bars consumed in the country in construction, metal carpentry and structural reinforcement implements such as steel plates, billets, square or round bars for industrial hardware, etc. The decision will enable the State to guarantee the supply of steel bars, which are a major item in the construction of housing, especially given the strategic and priority needs of thousands of Venezuelan victims of the natural disaster caused by the heavy rains of December . It will also serve to combat the company s speculative marketing policy and thereby promote the development of the construction sector in line with the needs of the people and the development of the country. Moreover, the measure complies with the State s decision to take control of all strategic activities linked to the processing of iron in the Guayana region, in order to integrate all the aluminium, iron and steel production processes and, thereby ensure that the country s means of production serve the interests of all Venezuelan citizens. In this the workers of Venezuela play a fundamental role, in keeping with the status, value and force of the Organic Act governing Enterprises engaged in Activities in the Steel Sector in the Guayana region.
.The Government has decreed the expropriation of the transnational company Agroislea, SA, which held the position of a speculative oligopoly engaged in unfair competition by creating unfavourable conditions for others producer for  years, in violation of the state of law and justice in Venezuela. The company had imposed an exponential increase in prices for inputs that were up to  per cent higher than market prices. That then led to an increase in the price of finished products, the exploitation of rural producers and the generation of a speculative spiral. In addition, it encouraged the use of a series of toxic agro-chemicals, including some whose sale is regulated or banned worldwide. The monopoly under which Agroislea, SA, operated extended to the agricultural production chain, where it earned high fees for technical assistance, harvesting services and storage of agricultural products, thereby ensuring the financial and technological dependency of small producers on a technology involving a high concentration of insecticides. The company opened up a credit line with the Bank of Venezuela at  per cent interest which it passed on to producers at  to  per cent, without the requisite authorization to operate as a sort of pseudo-bank. Article  of the Food Security and Self-Sufficiency Act stipulates the following:  Any assets that ensure the availability and opportune supply of quality foodstuffs in sufficient quantity for the people of Venezuela, together with the necessary infrastructure for them to operate, shall be deemed of public utility and social interest. In cases where the security of agricultural foodstuffs is at stake, the Executive may decree the compulsory acquisition of the assets concerned, subject to fair compensation and opportune payment of all or part of one or more assets needed to execute works or develop activities relating to the production, commerce, distribution and storage of foodstuffs.' The Government has reduced the production costs of agricultural inputs by  to  per cent, thereby further encouraging the development of the agricultural sector, guaranteeing self sufficiency in agricultural foodstuffs and promoting the distribution chain of agricultural inputs by means of the industrialization, processing, transport, storage and sale of products and by-products derived from agricultural and livestock production. The Government repeats that, once the decree on expropriation has been published and in strict compliance with relevant legislation, a judicial process will result in the payment of a fair price based on a joint review by the company s board of directors and the Government of each and every operation engaged in by Agroislea, SA In addition, all the company s employees have been guaranteed that their labour and social rights will be respected.
.Commenting on the legal proceedings brought against Mr Gmez Sigala, now a deputy of the National Assembly, the Government states that from the start he enjoyed all the guarantees provided for under the national and international laws and regulations. Following the interim measures taken by the Public Prosecutor s Office, the Government repeats that the investigation indicated that there were no grounds for conviction and the Fifth Public Prosecutor s Office for the State of Lara decided on  August  to dismiss the case. It is thus clear that there was absolutely no question of  personal harassment'  as claimed by the complainant, and that on the contrary the proper legal proceeding were fully adhered to.
.The Government states once again that labour solvency refers to an administrative document issued by the body responsible for labour policy, which certifies that employer respect workers' social, labour and union rights, which have for years been denied in violation of the Constitution, specific laws on the subject and article  of Decree No. , published in Official Gazette No.  on  February . Standard procedures require that complainants be guaranteed due legal process and impartiality.
.A labour solvency certificate can be obtained quickly and automatically from the website of the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour and Social Security, http://www.mintra.dov.ve/, where users can access the necessary requirements and information. Employers must first register with the National Registry of Enterprises and Establishments on the web page and present a number of documents concerning the enterprise. Five days later, the Ministry transmits the certificate through the appropriate channels and the employer can collect it from the Labour Inspectorate where he or she is officially domiciled.
.In accordance with article  of the Decree No. , the labour inspector must refuse to issue or revoke a certificate if the employer has not complied with established legal requirements. Article  of Resolution No.  of  March , published in Official Gazette No.  of the same date, provides that, if labour solvency is denied or revoked, the employer may appeal against the decision in accordance with articles  and  of the Administrative Procedures Act. It is clear from the above that the procedure is transparent, non-discriminatory and legal, and that the national laws and regulations provide for the possibility to appeal.
.Concerning the procedure for acquiring foreign currency, the Government repeats that it is the same for all employers and that a computerized application system exists through CADIVl s webpage http://www.cadivi.gob.ve, which has all the necessary information and requirements. It is important to note that, in order to handle requests for foreign currency for basic consumer goods (medical supplies and food) and for the importation of capital goods, inputs and raw materials, CADIVI has introduced administrative measures to facilitate the Government s foreign currency system and thus strengthen the country s production sector and the wellbeing of its citizens.
.The Standards and Procedures Manual for registering the documents required by CADIVI sets out the appeals procedure provided for in articles  and  of the Administrative Procedures Act. The procedure showing the requirements for initiating the computerized appeals process in all transparency is also available on CADIVI s website.
.The Government has emphasizes and reiterates its earlier statement that there is no lack of independence whatsoever among Venezuela s employers' organizations, nor is there any discrimination vis--vis organizations in the employer sector, where they are all treated equally. It repeats that Government cannot under any principle be held accountable for the decision of some employers to exclude themselves. Furthermore, it wishes to register its dismay at and repudiation of the additional information presented by the IOE in its communication dated  June  as a supplement to its complaint in Case No.  presented to the ILO on  July. The Government rejects and denies the accusations most categorically and finds it very difficult to express an opinion on the substance of the matter as presented, as it is without foundation. It refutes every word of the additional information, which does not compromise the Government s position in any way.
.The Government categorically refuses to accept the accusation once again that it that it interferes in the affairs of employers' organizations, especially as it is based on documents that did not emanate from the Government or its representatives and which it therefore considers of doubtful origin and authorship and completely invalid. The fact that the persons alleged by the IOE to have issued the said documents deny all knowledge of them has to be taken up with other bodies and is outside the Government s sphere of responsibility. In stating its position the Government cannot be expected to discuss so called electronic mail of which it is unaware and which does not in any way compromise or challenge its action, which has always abided by the law. The Government trusts that the Committee will dismiss these unfounded claims in strictest compliance with its principles.
.The Committee first of all notes the Government s statements under the heading  Preliminary observations'",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
177,"where it refers to: () the Committee s alleged failure to lend any credit to the arguments, replies and evidence it has advanced and its readiness to believe the allegations of the complainants, even though most of them are baseless; () allegations to which the Government has already replied in detail; () its claim that many of the complainants' allegations are beyond the purview of freedom of association and have to do with the Venezuela s political, economic, criminal or juridical affairs; and () the Committee s peremptory tone regarding compliance with the law and its request that the legal procedure not be respected, in the form of recommendations that conflict with Venezuela s laws and regulations. The Committee wishes to point out in this respect that the present case has been included in the category of extremely serious and urgent cases and that the gravity of the situation faced by FEDECAMARAS, Venezuela s principal employers' organization, is confirmed by the nature and evidence of alleged incidents such as the temporary abduction of four employers' leaders (one of them, an employers' representative on the Governing Body of the ILO, having sustained three bullet wounds), two attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters, highly aggressive declarations by the authorities against this organization that are liable to create a climate of intimidation, and serious shortcomings in terms of social dialogue with the organization. To compound the situation the Government has failed to respond to the Committee s principal recommendations; the Committee regrets, for example that instead of trying to resolve the problems raised through direct dialogue with FEDECAMARAS as requested, the Government states that it  cannot be held accountable' for an organization s decision to exclude itself. If the Committee sometimes expresses itself forcefully and energetically ' as it does in its dealings with other countries ' it is because of the seriousness of the problems raised and/or because of the Government s refusal to comply with the Committee s recommendations and, ultimately, with the objective of its procedure which is to promote respect for the rights of employers' and workers' organizations under Conventions Nos  and  which Venezuela, moreover, has ratified, by means of a tripartite process offering every guarantee of impartiality.
.Regarding the alleged acts of violence against employers' leaders and members of FEDECAMARAS and against its headquarters, the Committee wishes to refer to the conclusions it reached in March  [see th Report, paras ' ]:' The Committee notes with deep concern the allegations of the IOE according to which: () on the night of  October , in Caracas, a group of five armed and hooded men machine-gunned, kidnapped and maltreated the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel Alvarez, its former President, Ms Albis Muoz, the executive director, Mr Luis Villegas and its treasurer, Mr Ernesto Villamil. The kidnappers fired three shots into the body of Ms Albis Muoz, employer member of the ILO Governing Body. After she had lost a lot of blood, the attackers dragged her from the vehicle in which she was travelling and dumped her near the Prez Carreo Hospital, where she was taken some time later by a passing police patrol. The other three abducted persons were released two hours later, after the abductors had faked an abduction, expressed their intention to demand a ransom of  million bolivars, and stolen their belongings. According to the IOE, the manner of the attack suggests that its purpose was to decapitate the business leadership of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, although it was afterwards disguised as an abduction.' The Committee notes the statements according to which: () the Government condemns and investigates any act of violence against persons living in the country. It therefore deplores and condemns what happened on  October  to Ms Albis Muoz and the FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas and Ernesto Villamil; () as soon as the facts were known, the competent authorities of the Venezuelan State immediately launched an investigation in order to clarify what had happened, identify those responsible and bring them to trial, in accordance with national legislation; () given that the investigation into the incident is in progress, until the results are known, any speculative suggestion such as that expressed by the Secretary-General of the IOE, is unjustified and not serious, when he indicates that ' ... purpose of the attack was to decapitate Venezuela s business leadership, although it was afterwards disguised as an abduction'  In this regard, no representative of FEDECAMARAS made a similar official complaint in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; the Government categorically rejects the irresponsible, unfounded and false allegations with which, with impunity, they seek to link public institutions, even up to the highest representatives of the State, with acts of violence against Venezuelan business leaders; () on  November , as a result of the investigations carried out by the competent authorities, two people, Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jaron Manjares, were arrested for their direct participation in the incident which occurred on  October. In addition a warrant was issued for the arrest of Mr Cristian Leonardo Castro Rojas, who is currently a fugitive from justice; and () a further two persons are suspected of being involved, but they have not yet been identified with certainty and all of these people are members of a criminal gang engaged in and abduction. The arrested persons are being tried in Caracas Metropolitan District Court .' The Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee notes with concern the IOE s statement in its additional information that Ms Albis Muoz, employers' leader and one of the victims of aggression, has asserted that neither of the suspects arrested (Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression, that the four abducted officials were held for about two hours and that Ms Albis Muoz sustained three bullet wounds, which does not bear out the contention that the motive for the crime was car theft as indicated by the Director of the Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigations Unit. The Committee notes the Government s statement refuting the idea of a supposed attack by the Government and confirming that the criminal investigation is in the hands of the Public Prosecutor. The Government states that on  December  the Public Prosecutor s Office brought charges against Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Jason Manjares, accusing them of temporary abduction, that a preliminary hearing was held on  February  by the appropriate Supervisory Tribunal, which confirmed the charges and ordered that the accused stand trial on  October , and that as soon as a final ruling on the case has been handed down, the Committee will be duly informed.
.The Committee wishes to express its grave concern that according to the allegations the suspects have not been identified by Ms Albis Muoz as being responsible for the crime and that the charges do not include attempted homicide and the wounding of the employers' leader. The Committee also observes with concern that the Government provides no information on whether Mr Christian Leonardo Castro Rojas (a fugitive from justice) and the two other suspects in the case have been arrested. Consequently, the Committee has no alternative but to reiterate its earlier recommendation as follows:The Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Regarding the allegation that the Public Prosecutor s Office initiated a criminal investigation on  December  to ascertain whether, in his statement of  December , the President of FEDECAMARAS, Noel lvarez, committed a crime by calling on the FANB to respect the Constitution and not to accept orders that they judged might violate the Constitution or any other law (according to the Government the President of FEDECAMARAS asked the members of the FANB to read article  of the Constitution, which states:  Any act on the part of the public authority that violates or encroaches upon the rights guaranteed by this Constitution and by law is null and void, and public",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
178,"employees ordering or implementing such an act shall incur criminal, civil and administrative liability, as applicable, without the fact of having followed the orders of a superior serving as an excuse,' and declared:  I wish to appeal to them to exercise their freedom of conscience by refusing to carry out any order which they deem to be a violation of the Constitution' . The IOE states that President Chvez declared on  December  that the FEDECAMARAS President s appeal to military personnel to respect the Constitution and the law was a  call to war' and expressed the opinion that it was a  statement that bordered on the criminal'  The IOE concludes that Mr Noel lvarez is not guilty of any crime since he had at no time called on any one not to respect the Constitution but rather to respect it.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent any observations on this allegation. In the absence of a reply, the Committee wishes to state that, given the context, the declarations of the President of FEDECAMARAS do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and, if they were as reported by the IOE should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. However, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation.
.Regarding the alleged attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee requested FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint on the subject with the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Committee reiterates that recommendation and states that if the organization has not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further; noting however that an environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities is not conducive to the proposed lodging of official complaints.
.Regarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the persons charged, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, have confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, that a preliminary public hearing was set for  November  and that, as soon as a final ruling on the case was handed down, the Committee would be duly informed. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties should be punished in proportion to the seriousness of the crimes committed and the employer organization compensated for the loss and damage on account of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.
.Observing the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS or its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .
.Regarding the alleged criminal charges brought against Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala and his subsequent trial, the Committee notes with interest the Government s statement regarding the dismissal of the case by the Fifth Public Prosecutor s Office on  August  when the investigation showed that there was no evidence against him and that he is now at liberty. Moreover, according to the government, Mr Gmez Sigala has been elected to the National Assembly where he is currently exercising his functions.
.Regarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes the Government s declaration that: () the farm measures . hectares and not  hectares as the IOE stated in its complaint; () the land rescue procedure involved was carried out in accordance with the law and in view of the fact that  hectares of the land was underutilized and being used for crops that were not suited to the type of soil, thereby engendering a process of deterioration and having a negative environmental impact. The Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government judgment that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that the farm is currently a military training centre (contrary to the Government s statement that the purpose of the land rescue procedure is to encourage the agricultural use of the Valle del Ro) or the allegation that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee therefore requests the Government to respond fully to the allegations and in the meantime cannot but maintain its earlier recommendation. The Committee therefore once again calls on the Government to return the  La Bureche' farm property to the employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala without delay and to compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm.
.Regarding the alleged abduction of  agricultural and livestock farmers, the Committee notes that the Government needs detailed information on the events and persons referred to by the complainant organizations if it is to make any observations. The Committee therefore requests the IPE and FEDECAMARAS to provide that information and indicates that if the organizations have not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of these allegations any further.
.Regarding the alleged death of a livestock farmer (Mr Franklin Brito) as a result of going on a succession of hunger strikes in protest against the Government for the unjust invasion and expropriation of his land, the Committee notes the extensive information supplied by the Government, and notably its assertion that it did everything it could to protect Mr Brito s physical integrity, even to the extent of obliging him to receive medical attention. The Committee observes that, according to the Government, Mr Brito s hunger strike was not directed against the Government or against the occupation and expropriation of his farm but that was apparently linked to the non-payment of some of his earnings (in fact, the Government states, he did not cash the cheque in payment because he wanted a fixed-term appointment as he had given up his job as a supply teacher) and to a border dispute between neighbouring farmers after the land-use and regulation process had been completed and had awarded him title to . hectares. The Committee duly notes this information and invites the complainants to provide their observations thereon.
.In their earlier allegations the IOE and FEDECAMARAS stated the following [see paras ' ]:The IOE and FEDECAMARAS highlight that in the last few months, the Government has multiplied attacks against the private sector, issuing numerous expropriation orders against companies without the slightest legal justification and without any financial compensation. In this regard, on  June , President Chvez declared ' economic war on the business sector and its representatives, especially FEDECAMARAS. He added ' I declare myself in a state of economic war. Let s see who comes out on top, you bourgeois trash or those who love their country.It should be emphasized that recently, on  October , the company Agroislea SA, which is crucial to the agriculture and livestock industry of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the chief distributor of farming products with  sales outlets and eight silos across the country, was nationalized. The order for the expropriation of Agroislea was widely rejected by producers and company workers. In Barinas, the state police used teargas to disperse a protest by  producers. After this action, one producer was arrested and injured.On  October , an order was approved for the expropriation for the Venezuelan subsidiary of the United States company, Owen Illinois, the world leader in the manufacture of glass containers for drinks, food, medicines and cosmetics.On  October , President Chvez ordered the expropriation of the Siderrgica del Turbio (Sidetur), a subsidiary of the private Venezuelan steel group SIVENSA, and six urban complexes were paralysed and a further eight were temporarily occupiedThe announcement concerning Owen Illinois brought the number of expropriated companies in  to , most of them without any compensation. In ,  companies were expropriated, not including companies in the agricultural sector. As highlighted by the firm Eco-analtica and the Venezuelan American Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VenAmCham), nationalizations and state takeovers worth $, million have been ordered since , but only $, million have been paid in compensation, representing one third of the expropriations. The pace of takeovers of private companies by the Government without compensation has been accelerating in recent months. In the last three years, the Venezuelan Government nationalized  companies in strategic sectors such as electricity, banking, cement, steel, oil and food. Of this total,",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
179,"half were taken over between January and August . The exponential number and headlong rush of expropriations without compensation by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is seriously endangering the viability, development and national output in key sectors of the economy, which as well as causing heavy economic losses also generates unemployment and poverty across large swathes of the population.
.The Committee notes the Government s assertion that these cases have nothing whatsoever to do with the allegations contained in the complaint or with the complainants themselves and that it invites the Committee once again to review very carefully the validity and receivability of the allegations it includes in Case No. . The Committee emphasizes, however, that the complainant organization s allegations occur in a general climate of hostility on the part of the Government and of discrimination vis--vis FEDECAMARAS and its members.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the expropriation procedure provided for in the national legislation has nothing in common with the attacks and harassment aimed at the private sector, FEDECAMARAS and its leaders that they accuse it of, that the appropriation procedure is governed by article . and  and article  of the Constitution, pursuant to article  of the Public or Social Utility Expropriation Act and article  of the Access to Goods and Services Defence Act, and that, although the Government is perfectly willing to provide the legal reasons for the said procedures, the Committee would be in no position to discuss or oppose its decisions on the matter of public utility, let alone to query the Government s economic policy in taking such action. The Committee notes that, more to the point, the Government states, concerning the Owens Illinois case that, in strict compliance with the Constitution, the Government decreed the expropriation of the United States glass processing plant located in Venezuela, having established that the company had taken over  per cent of production in the sector and was therefore operating under an illegal monopoly that constituted a violation of the state of law and justice in the country, inasmuch as it ran counter to the free competition provided for in the Constitution. In addition to combating a monopoly, the decision served to protect the environment, since the company had for over  years been damaging the mountain region of Los Guayos y Valera by extracting unlimited quantities of sand, carbonate and limestone for the manufacture of glass. At the same time, the Government guaranteed the labour rights of the employees, set up works' committees and respected fully the collective agreements covering the great majority of workers in the plants located in Valencia, State of Carabobo and in Valera, State of Trujillo. Moreover, the Government states that its decision strengthens the country s industrial sector thanks to the production of glass containers for food, drinks and medicines, etc., that are necessary for the development of the country and for the proper wellbeing of the people. The Government places on the record that in strict compliance with Venezuelan legislation, a legal process is to be initiated following publication of the decree on expropriation, which will entail numerous meetings with the company s executives in a spirit of mutual respect and tranquillity and will result in the payment of a fair price. The Committee regrets that it has not been informed of the action taken or the outcome.
.Regarding the expropriation of the Turbio steel plant, the Committee notes the Government s statement that it has decreed the expropriation of the Turbio steel plant (Sidetur) located in the Punta Cuchillo sector of Ciudad Guayana, State of Bolvar, in strict compliance with constitutional principles. The company controlled  per cent of the steel bars consumed in the country in construction, metal carpentry and structural reinforcement implements such as steel plates, billets, square or round bars for industrial hardware, etc. The decision will enable the State to guarantee the supply of steel bars, which are a major item in the construction of housing, especially given the strategic and priority needs of thousands of Venezuelan victims of the natural disaster caused by the heavy rains of December . It will also serve to combat the company s speculative marketing policy and thereby promote the development of the construction sector in line with the needs of the people and the development of the country. Moreover, the measure complies with the State s decision to control all strategic activities linked to the processing of iron in the Guayana region in order to integrate all the aluminium, iron and steel production processes, thereby ensuring that the country s means of production serve the interests of all Venezuelan citizens. In this the workers of Venezuela play a fundamental role, in keeping with the status, value and force Organic Act governing Enterprises engaged in Activities in the Steel Sector in the region of Guayana.
.Regarding the expropriation of Agroislea, SA, the Committee notes that the Government has decreed the expropriation of the transnational company Agroislea, SA, which held the position of a speculative oligopoly engaged in unfair competition by creating unfavourable conditions for others producer for the past  years, in violation of the state of law and justice in Venezuela. The company had imposed an exponential increase in prices for inputs that were up to  per cent higher than market prices. This then led to an increase in the price of finished products, the exploitation of rural producer and the generation of a speculative spiral. In addition, it encouraged the use of a series of toxic agro-chemicals, including some whose sale is regulated or banned worldwide. The monopoly under which Agroislea, SA, operated extended to the agricultural production chain, where it earned high fees for technical assistance, harvesting services and storage of agricultural products, thereby ensuring the financial and technological dependency of small producers on a technology involving a high concentration of insecticides. The company opened up a credit line with the Bank of Venezuela at  per cent interest which it passed on to producers at  to  per cent, without the requisite authorization to operate as a sort of pseudo-bank. Article  of the Food Security and Self-Sufficiency Act stipulates the following:  Any assets that ensure the availability and opportune supply of quality foodstuffs in sufficient quantity for the people of Venezuela, together with the necessary infrastructure for them to operate, shall be deemed of public utility and social interest. In cases where the security of agricultural foodstuffs is at stake, the Executive may decree the compulsory acquisition of the assets concerned, subject to fait compensation and opportune payment of all or part of one or more assets required for the execution of works or the development of activities relating to the production, commerce, distribution and storage of foodstuffs.' The Government has reduced the production costs of agricultural inputs by  to  per cent, thereby further promoting the development of the agricultural sector and guaranteeing self-sufficiency in agricultural foodstuffs as well as the distribution chain of agricultural inputs by means of the industrialization, processing, transport, storage and sale of products and by-products derived from agricultural and livestock production. The Government repeats that, in strict compliance with the relevant legislation, following the publication of the decree on expropriation a judicial process is to ensure that will result in the payment of a fair price based on a joint review by the company s board of directors and the Government of each and every operation engaged in by Agroislea, SA In addition, all the company s employees have been guaranteed that their labour and social rights will be respected.
.The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide their comments on the above information and requests the Government to examine the allegations with FEDECAMARAS and to assess the situation.
.Regarding the alleged harassment and intimidation of officials and members of FEDECAMARAS, which according to the allegations include the occupation and expropriation of farms and enterprises (in many cases without due compensation), the Committee reached the following conclusions at its March  meeting [see th report, para. ]:The Committee notes that, according to the IOE, as a consequence of their work to defend their members, representatives of employers' organizations, and the private sector in general, are constantly harassed and threatened. The IOE complains of attacks against the property of the former Presidents of FEDECAMARAS, Messrs Vicente Brito, Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Carlos Sequera Ypez, as well as against Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the current President of FEDENAGA (the leading agricultural sector body affiliated to FEDECAMARAS) and its former President, Mr Genaro Mndez, and also Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, former President of CONINDUSTRIA (the leading industrial sector body affiliated to FEDECAMARAS). Also, according to the IOE, the National Land Institute (INTI) together with the National Guard constantly occupy productive farms under the so-called  Land Recovery Plan'  The INTI could only reclaim those lands which it owned, and that is not the case of the properties of the expropriated business",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
180,"leader.
.The Committee notes the Government s extensive information on the legal basis for the  land rescue' process and on the objectives set (self-sufficiency in agricultural foodstuffs, development of the indigenous populations and social economy, gradual social insertion of the least privileged segments of society, development of sustainable agriculture, total elimination of the  latifundista' regime). The Committee notes the Government s statement that the land rescue procedure conducted by the National Land Institute does not involve the confiscation or occupation of, or attacks on, buildings, but that the Institute can intervene in cases where land is idle or uncultivated and where it is unproductive or being used illegally. The Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government ' which differs widely from that presented by the IOE ' on the allegations concerning the owners and why the rescue procedures were initiated (idle or unproductive land, or, in certain cases, land being used for raising cattle when its high fertility is particularly suitable for growing crops) but recalls that its function is not to determine whether or not the authorities' actions comply with the law. The Committee wishes to emphasize that it is not within its mandate to speak to matters of agrarian reform except in so far as the steps taken constitute discrimination against employers or where they concern enterprises where workers are employed and where breaches of Conventions Nos  or  are alleged. On this point the Committee cannot but observe that the persons affected by the land rescue procedures include at least five important officials or former officials of FEDECAMARAS or of affiliated associations, and that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. In its previous allegations the IOE did, moreover, emphasize that four employers' leaders had not been paid the compensation provided for in the legislation and since they cannot now carry out their productive activities, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay. Moreover, in view of the divergencies between the allegations and the Government s reply concerning the alleged instances of confiscation/rescue (cited in the previous paragraph) and their legal justification, as well as the significant number of officials and former officials of FEDECAMARAS and its affiliates that are concerned, the Committee requests the Government to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Mr Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS.
.Regarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without any tripartite consultation of laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. In addition to the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Act (which will be examined below and which restricts the international operations of NGOs), the IOE refers to laws that allegedly restrict the freedom of association, regulate the content of the Internet, give the State greater control over telecommunications and the possibility of punishing radio and television stations, and the Communal Economic System Act which, in its opinion, is so vague as to leave it open to broad interpretation that would be prejudicial to freedom of expression. The IOE further alleges that at the end of December  a new Act once again confers powers on the President that allow him to govern by decree for the following  months. This Act covers numerous fields affecting employers' organizations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has expressed its concern that the Act constitutes a serious threat to the principle of the separation of powers and to freedom of association. This is the fourth enabling Act under which over  laws have been passed, and the IOE adds that under the latest enabling Act the Land and Housing Emergency Act was promulgated without any tripartite consultation despite the fact that it governs the expropriation of urban land and buildings. The Committee notes that the Government refers back to statements made in earlier examinations of this case, adding that it regularly holds consultations, meetings and discussions with employers' and workers' organizations, including FEDECAMARAS, that that it cannot be held accountable for an organization s decision to exclude itself. The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded specifically to these allegations of the IOE or to the Committee s recommendations of March  and urges it to do so without delay. Moreover, observing that the serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.
.The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has once again ignored these recommendation despite the fact that the Committee has been insisting on them for years.
.Regarding the alleged discrimination by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and the allegations of favouritism vis--vis parallel organizations close to the Government, the Committee reproduces here its earlier conclusions on the subject [see th report, paras ' ]:The Committee notes that the IOE alleges that the finances parallel organizations to FEDECAMARAS with official subsidies. It attaches, in this regard, an extract from the financial report of the Economic and Social Development Bank (BANDES) of  June . This report indicates that Entrepreneurs for Venezuela (EMPREVEN) was granted an allocation of ,, bolivars and a further allocation of , bolivars. Furthermore, national financial institutions give priority to cases processed by EMPREVEN (the organization backed by President Chvez) to the detriment of those which are not affiliated to it. The Foreign Exchange Commission (CADIVI) allocated dollars for imports in  per cent of the cases processed by EMPREVEN. The Government s support to official companies was also expressed by the investment of three billion bolivars in the Bicentenary Fund which finances  social production companies' which participate in export and import substitution plans, but not to private enterprises represented by FEDECAMARAS. According to the IOE, the intention to replace private companies, which are being strangled by legal constraints and requirements, with socialist enterprises which obtain preferential credits, is a fact. The consequence of this situation is that since the President of the Republic came to power, the number of companies in the country fell from , to ,.The Committee observes with regret that the Government has not replied to these allegations of discrimination against FEDECAMARAS and its members concerning parallel bodies and organizations close to the Government. The Committee requests the Government to send without delay its observations on these allegations and wishes to emphasize that by favouring or disadvantaging",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
181,"certain organizations compared with the rest, governments can influence the attitude of workers or employers when they choose which organization they wish to join, which is incompatible with the principle contained in Convention No. , whereby public authorities must refrain from any interference which would restrict the rights enshrined in the Convention.
.The Committee regrets that the Government once again has not responded specifically to these allegations and confines itself to asserting that it does not encourage or become involved in the establishment or activities of employers' organizations, to denying across the board that there is no favouritism, discrimination or lack of independence with respect to any Venezuelan employers' organization and affirming that the Government cannot by any principle be held responsible for the self-exclusion of certain members of the employers' sector. The Committee therefore reiterates its earlier conclusions, recommendations and principles.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes the IOE s new allegations denouncing the lack of independence of, and the Government s interference in, parallel employers' organizations that it has been supporting for the past five years as part of the employers' delegation to the International Labour Conference. The Committee observes in this respect that the IOE is referring to correspondence (electronic mail which it attaches) from a senior official of the Ministry of Popular Power for Agriculture to an official representative diplomat of the Venezuelan Government in Geneva and to the EMPREVEN, Confagan, Fedeindustrias and Coboien organizations ' which it describes as being under Government influence ' which includes instructions and suggestions for these organizations in their dealings with the IOE and with the Conference Credentials Committee.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements concerning these allegations, according to which: () there is no lack of independence among Venezuela s employers' organizations nor any discrimination vis--vis organizations affiliated to the employers' sector but that all such organizations are treated on an equal footing, and that the Government cannot by any principle be held accountable for some members of the sector deciding to exclude themselves; () the Government expresses its dismay at and repudiation of the additional information presented by the IOE; it repudiates and rejects categorically any such accusation and finds it very difficult to express an opinion on the substance of the matter as presented, as it is without foundation; it refutes every word of the additional information which does not compromise the Government s position in any way; () the Government also categorically refuses to accept the accusation once again that it interferes in the affairs of employers' organizations, especially as they are based on documents that were not issued by the Government or its representatives and which it therefore considers of doubtful origin and authorship and completely invalid; () the fact that the persons alleged by the IOE to have issued the said documents deny all knowledge of them has to be taken up with other bodies and is outside the Government s sphere of responsibility; () in stating its official position the Government cannot be expected to entertain so-called electronic mail of which it is unaware and which does not in any way compromise or challenge Government action that has always abided by the law; () the Government trusts that the Committee will dismiss these unfounded claims in strictest compliance with its principles.
.In this respect, and noting that the complainants' allegations also concern alleged denial of rights before the ILO, the Committee calls on the Government to verify without delay with the senior officials concerned whether or not they or their representatives sent the electronic mail attached to the IOE s deposition.
.Regarding the Committee s question as to the means of recourse available to employers who feel that they are victims of discrimination involving refusal to issue a labour solvency certificate (a document issued by the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour certifying that employers respect in full the labour and trade union rights of their workers which is an essential requirement for concluding contracts with the State) or official foreign exchange authorizations, the Committee duly notes the Government s statement concerning the functioning of the system and, in particular, the existence of means of recourse for anyone who feels victimized.
.Regarding the Bill on international cooperation (Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Bill), the Committee had hoped in its earlier recommendation that the Bill would provide for some form or rapid appeal in cases of discrimination (among organizations) to avoid interference by the authorities in the access of workers' and employers' organizations to external funds. In this respect, the Committee notes that in its new allegations, the IOE states that the National Assembly approved at its second reading the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Act, which prevents Venezuelan employers' and workers' organizations from receiving any kind of international assistance, inasmuch as article  of the Act stipulates that the assets and other income of politically motivated or political rights defence organizations must derive exclusively from national assets and resources. According to the IOE, the Government considers that employers' and workers' organization are included in this category. The IOE emphasizes that the Act was approved at its second reading despite the objection voiced by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights to the ambiguity of the wording of certain clauses of the Bill and the broad discretion it left the authorities responsible for implementing the Act. In this respect, the Committee regrets that the Government has not responded to these allegations and that the IOE has sent the Committee the text of the Bill approved at its second reading but that it appears that the Act itself has not yet been adopted.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee wishes to draw attention to the principle whereby all national organizations of workers and employers should have the right to receive financial assistance from international organizations of workers and employers respectively, whether or not they are affiliated to the latter [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. However, the Committee is unable to determine whether the Bill applies to employers' and workers' organizations and calls on the Government to ensure respect for the above principle and, if the Bill does indeed apply to them, to take the necessary measures without delay to amend the Bill (or the Act) so as to guarantee explicitly the rights of employers' and workers' organizations to receive international financial assistance without prior authorization from the authorities for activities related to the promotion and defence of the interests of their members.
.Regarding the complainant organization s comments on the Central Planning Commission Act, the Committee had observed in its earlier examination of the case that the legislation establishes strong state intervention in the economy and national economic structure under the aegis of central planning in order to construct the Venezuelan socialist model and had requested the complainant organizations to provide information on the relationship between the allegations and the violation of Conventions Nos  and . The Committee reiterates this recommendation and indicates that if the organizations have not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of these allegations any further.
.Finally, as regards the High-level Tripartite Mission decided upon with the consent of the Government in connection with the issues raised, the Committee observes that this question is dealt with in Governing Body document GB./INS/INF/. Also, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations in relation to the recent IOE communication dated  February  alleging repeated failure to engage in tripartite consultations with respect to legislative matters.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Regarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee notes the Government s statement that a public hearing was scheduled for  October  and expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. At the same time, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s statement in its additional information that Ms Albis Muoz, employers' leader and one of the victims of aggression, has asserted that neither of the suspects arrested (Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression, as well as the IOE s reservations as to the idea that the motive of the aggression was car theft.(b)	Regarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
182,"Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. However, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation.(c)	Regarding the alleged attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee had requested FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint on the subject with the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Committee reiterates that recommendation and indicates that if the organization has not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further; noting however that an environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities is not conducive to the proposed lodging of its official complaints.(d)	Regarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the persons charged, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, have confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, that a preliminary public hearing was set for  November  and that, as soon as a final ruling on the case was handed down, the Committee would be duly informed. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties should be punished in proportion to the seriousness of the crimes committed and the employer organization compensated for the loss and damage on account of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(e)	Observing the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS or its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(f)	Regarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to the employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s judgment that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that the farm is currently a military training centre (as opposed to the Government s statement that the purpose of the land rescue procedure is to encourage the agricultural use of the Valle del Ro) or the allegation that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee therefore once again calls on the Government to respond fully to the allegations, return the farm property without delay to the employers' leader and compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm.(g)	The Committee requests the complainant organizations to send their comments on the information and observations presented by the Government concerning the expropriation of Agroislea SA, Owen Illinois and the Turbio steel plant.(h)	The Committee invites the complainants to provide their observations on the Government statement on the livestock farmer Mr Franklin Brito.(i)	Regarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay and to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Mr Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS.(j)	Regarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without any tripartite consultation of laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded specifically to these allegations of the IOE and urges it to do so without delay. Moreover, observing that the serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue.

Regarding the IOE s new allegations concerning the sending of electronic mails between senior officials and parallel employers' organizations, the Committee calls on the Government to verify without delay with the senior officials concerned whether or not they or their representatives sent the electronic mail attached to the IOE s deposition.(l)	Regarding the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Bill, the Committee calls on the Government to ensure respect for the abovementioned principle as regards international financial assistance to workers' and employers' organizations so that, if the Bill does indeed apply to them, to take the necessary measures without delay to amend the Bill (or the Act) so as to guarantee explicitly the rights of employers' and workers' organizations to receive international financial assistance without prior authorization from the authorities for activities related to the promotion and defence of the interests of their members.(m)	Regarding the complainant organization s comments on the Central Planning Commission Act, the Committee had observed in its earlier examination of the case that the legislation establishes strong state intervention in the economy and national economic structure under the aegis of central planning in order to construct the Venezuelan socialist model and had requested the complainant organizations to provide information on the relationship between the allegations and the violation of Conventions Nos  and .

.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting of March  and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.Subsequently, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) sent new allegations in a communication dated  October, two communications dated  November  and additional information in a communication dated  February . The Government sent new observations in communications dated  May and  and  November  and  February .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its March  meeting, the Committee considered it necessary to draw the attention of the Governing Body to this case due to the extreme seriousness and urgency of the matters dealt with therein and made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, paras  and ]:(a) The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations concerning social dialogue. Specifically:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;(b) the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness;(c) the Committee observes that the two suspects wanted for the bomb attack on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters ( February ) have still not been arrested despite the time that has elapsed. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations and expresses its deep concern at the fact that the case relating to this attack has still not been resolved. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to step up the investigations, ensure that they are independent, clarify the facts, arrest the perpetrators and impose severe penalties on them to prevent any recurrence of such crimes. The Committee requests the Government also to step up the investigations into the attacks on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters which occurred in May and November , and conclude those investigations as a matter of urgency. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee again deeply deplores these attacks and recalls that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence. The Committee expresses its deep concern at this series of attacks and observes that they have effectively resulted in a situation of impunity that is incompatible with the provisions of Convention No. ;(d) the Committee once again requests the Government to revoke the warrant for the arrest of former FEDECAMARAS President Mr Carlos Fernndez, so that he may return to the country without risk of reprisals;(e) the Committee invites the complainant organizations to supply further details concerning the alleged deaths of six producers and the abduction of three sugar producers in ;(f) the Committee requests the Government to return the  La Bureche' farm property to the employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala without delay and to compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in the course of the property seizure. The Committee requests the complainant organizations and the Government to provide a detailed account of the charges against Mr Gmez Sigala, including the context and circumstances in which the events took place;(g) the Committee requests the Government to discuss with FEDECAMARAS issues relating to the application of legislation on  labour solvency' and the acquisition of foreign currency, with a view to allaying any concerns and guaranteeing that legislation is not applied on a discriminatory basis;(h) the Committee requests the Government to inform it as to progress in the adoption of the draft act on international cooperation (which is currently passing the second reading before the Legislative Assembly), the final version of which it trusts will contain provisions on rapid action in the event of discrimination;(i) the Committee invites the complainant organizations to supply additional information concerning their allegations of discrimination in relation to the Organic Act establishing the Central Planning Commission and harassment of employers' leaders through speeches given by the President of the Republic; and(j) the Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communication dated  October , the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) again complains, in common with the Venezuelan business community, the constant harassment by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of free enterprise in the country and complains of new attacks on the private sector and its representative organization, FEDECAMARAS. The IOE complains of failure by the Government to comply with the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in the last five years, including those made in its meeting of March .
.In its communication dated  November , the IOE alleges that on the night of  October , in Caracas, a group of five armed and hooded men machine-gunned, kidnapped and maltreated the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel Alvarez, its former President, Ms Albis Muoz, the Executive Director, Mr Luis Villegas and its Treasurer, Mr Ernesto Villamil. The kidnappers fired three shots into the body of Ms Albis Muoz, Employer member of the ILO Governing Body. After she had lost a lot of blood, the attackers dragged her from the vehicle in which she was travelling and dumped her near the Prez Carreo Hospital, where she was taken some time later by a passing police patrol. The other three abducted persons were released two hours later, after theabductors had faked an abduction, expressed their intention to demand a ransom of  million bolivars, and stolen their belongings.
.According to the IOE, the manner of the attack suggests that its purpose was to decapitate the business leadership of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, although it was afterwards disguised as an abduction.
.The IOE indicates that the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has an obligation to guarantee the life and safety of citizens and their institutions and recalls that FEDECAMARAS has been the target of violent attacks on its offices and leaders on many occasions, as has been reported in previous complaints to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The IOE emphasizes that the climate of aggression and hostility towards the private sector, especially towards FEDECAMARAS and its leaders which is constantly expressed in the highest institutions of the State, especially the President of the Republic",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
184,"himself, Mr Hugo Chvez, together with the growing insecurity in the country means that the State is responsible for this new violence against Venezuelan business leaders. It should be recalled, for example, that in June , President Chvez declared  economic war' on Venezuelan private entrepreneurs and their organizations.
.The IOE requests the Committee on Freedom of Association to invite the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to carry out a thorough investigation of this attack, to arrest and convict the perpetrators and stop the physical violence, confiscation of property and verbal attacks to which it incessantly subjected the business community and private companies in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.The IOE indicates that so far none of the attacks on FEDECAMARAS have led to the arrest and punishment of those responsible, despite the fact that the names of the persons and institutions behind them are known.
.In another communication dated  November , the IOE states that the Committee on Freedom of Association examined Case No.  at its meeting of , and made recommendations which were approved by the Governing Body, drawing the attention of the Governing Body to the  extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case'  The IOE complains that the Government has not complied with any of the recommendations made in the last five years.
.The IOE alleges that as a consequence of their work to defend their members, representatives of employers' organizations, and the private sector in general, are constantly harassed and threatened. On this occasion, the IOE complains of attacks against the property of the former Presidents of FEDECAMARAS, Messrs Vicente Brito, Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Carlos Sequera Ypez, as well as against Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the current President of FEDENAGA (the leading agricultural sector body affiliated to FEDECAMARAS) and its former President, Mr Genaro Mndez, and also Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, former President of CONINDUSTRIA (the leading industrial sector body affiliated to FEDECAMARAS). The National Land Institute (INTI) together with the National Guard constantly invade productive farms under the so-called  Land Recovery Plan'  The INTI could only  recover' those lands which it owned, and that is not the case of the properties of the expropriated business leaders.
.In the specific case of the farm of Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, former President of the Caracas Chamber of Commerce, the Venezuelan Chamber of Food and the CONINDUSTRIA Industrial Confederation, the IOE alleges that on  September , a group of  persons who claimed to be officials of the Lara Regional Land Office, accompanied by  members of the national armed forces, carrying automatic weapons, arrived at the entrance to the La Bureche farm. They threatened the farm manager, Mr Castejn Martnez, and ordered him to open the main door immediately, without showing any documentation. They entered the farm and took over the premises. From that point on, the entrance to the La Bureche farm remained under the strict control of the army, who set up several tents around Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala s family home. During that evening,  September , and during the following days, the La Bureche farm remained totally occupied by officials of the INTI, the Venezuelan Food Corporation and members of the national armed forces. Only vehicles belonging to these bodies were allowed to enter, together with tractors and heavy machinery which were used to destroy the  hectares of sugar cane growing there, which should have been harvested in two months' time.
.On  September , Mr Gmez Sigala tried to enter his family home, situated within the La Bureche farm. Army personnel seized Mr Gmez Sigala and forced him inside the farm, before putting him in a vehicle and taking him under arrest to the headquarters of the Thirteenth Infantry Division, located in the town of Barquisimeto in Lara State. There he was arbitrarily held prisoner until the evening of  September. In being released, he was taken to the Barquisimeto Supervisory Court (Tribunal de Control), where, to justify his detention, the Public Prosecutor s Office charged him with  resisting authority and minor personal injury'  because he had torn a sergeant s shirt during the struggle when he was forced to leave the farm. On the following day, the business leader was released on conditional bail subject to the obligation to report to the court or the Public Prosecutor s Office whenever required or needed for the investigation. It should be emphasized that there is no time limit or specific date was attached to this measure, thus the accused must remain indefinitely at the disposal of the authorities.
.The La Bureche farm is owned by the Agrcola Bureche , CA, a company based in Caracas. The company s memorandum and articles of association show that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala owns  per cent of the shares in Agrcola Bureche , CA, of which he is the sole director. On this estate, as well as sugar cane, grass and other crops, is his family home, which he uses frequently during his long stays in the town of Barquisimeto, which, in addition to Caracas, is the seat of his businesses and interests and is the place of residence of part of his family.
.Recently, the authorities came to move horses and cattle. The farm has currently been taken over by the military, who use it for military training. As of today, Mr Gmez Sigala is not allowed to enter the farm (see Annex ).
.In addition, the IOE alleges that despite the Committee s numerous requests, it regrets to have to report that the Government has not followed the Committee s recommendation to quash the order for the arrest of the former President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Carlos Fernndez, so that he may return to the country without fear of reprisals.
.The IOE also recalls that over three years ago, on  May , the headquarters of FEDECAMARAS was attacked by representatives of the Ezequiel Zamora National Campesino Front, the Simn Bolvar National Communal Front, the Alexis Vive Collective and the Simn Bolvar Coordinator, committing acts of violence against the institution and its premises. Those leaders were interviewed in the media where they identified themselves. To date, these violent groups have not been charged with anything.
.Another attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters occurred in February . On  February , metropolitan police inspector Mr Hctor Amado Serrano Abreu was killed by an explosive device when he was placing it against the front of the FEDECAMARAS headquarters building. On  February , the complaint concerning this incident was lodged with the Public Prosecutor s Office, requesting a thorough and exhaustive investigation of the facts and identification of those responsible. So far, there has been no visible result. In  and , the IOE continues, just before the International Labour Conference, these matters appeared in the media. Thus, just before the th Session of the International Labour Conference (), the Government said that it was dealing with the case and mentioned the persons under investigation and the courts handling the case. However, on  June , seven days after the end of the International Labour Conference, in letter No. -F-' -, the Public Prosecutor s Office told FEDECAMARAS that it  was ordering the case to be filed'  due to the impossibility of assembling sufficient evidence to allow the conviction of any person in the case. This letter was received at FEDECAMARAS' offices on  August , two months after the date when it was written and the necessary instructions were immediately given to appeal that decision. Up to now, no reply has been received. Recently, and before the th International Labour Conference (), it appeared in the press, on  May , that an active official of PoliCaracas, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya, had been identified as a member of the group which placed the bomb at FEDECAMARAS headquarters and had been arrested. However, on returning from the Conference, FEDECAMARAS was informed that Mr Montoya had been released and that, for no reason, all the charges against him had been dropped. Consequently, there has still been no visible result in this regard.
.The IOE considers that the Government s action can be summarized as a strategy to present a semblance of progress in the investigations into the attacks against FEDECAMARAS during the International Labour Conference. However, that cannot hide the fact that for over three years, since those criminal acts were committed, the Government has not shown any serious will to investigate and punish those responsible for the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS, thereby fostering a climate of hostility against FEDECAMARAS and one of impunity for those who attack the private sector and its representative organization, FEDECAMARAS.
.The IOE also points out that Mr Noel lvarez, the current President of FEDECAMARAS, after being interviewed by RCTV International, was the subject of an investigation by Public Prosecutor s Office  in the Caracas Metropolitan Area, and charges were brought against him for alleged offences against national security, rebellion, incitement to insurrection and incitement to commit criminal offences. As",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
185,"of today, Mr Noel lvarez has been denied the right to appoint his defence lawyers.
.There have been numerous threats and verbal attacks against the private sector representative organization, FEDECAMARAS, by the President of the Republic. Recently, on  June, at the beginning of the International Labour Conference , the President of the Republic stated that  FEDECAMARAS is an enemy of this people and we do not need it. More than that, let me make it crystal clear, I think this country can do without it'  Also, on  June , he said that FEDECAMARAS  is a great obstacle to the country s development'  and, therefore, he declared, its members were  enemies of the State'  On  October , as the annual assembly of FEDECAMARAS was ending, the President of the Venezuelan Republic stated that  FEDECAMARAS' does not exist' and declared in that regard  Do these people still exist? I do not recognize them, I don t know who they are' (the relevant annexes are attached).
.The IOE concludes that all the foregoing shows a clear and constant will by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to attack and destroy FEDECAMARAS, even though it is the national representative organization of the employers' side. The increasing frequency and content of the verbal attacks by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela against FEDECAMARAS is a cause for much concern.
.The IOE alleges that the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela finances parallel organizations to FEDECAMARAS by means of subsidies. In this regard, it attaches an extract from the financial report of the Economic and Social Development Bank (BANDES) of  June . This report indicates that Entrepreneurs for Venezuela (EMPREVEN) was granted an allocation of ,, bolivars and a further allocation of , bolivars. Furthermore, national financial institutions give priority to cases processed by EMPREVEN (the organization backed by President Chvez) to the detriment of those which are not affiliated to it. The Foreign Exchange Commission (CADIVI) allocated dollars for imports in  per cent of the cases processed by EMPREVEN (see annex).
.The Government s support to official companies was also expressed by the investment of  billion bolivars in the Bicentenary Fund which finances  social production companies' which participate in export and import substitution plans, but not to private enterprises represented by FEDECAMARAS.
.The result of the foregoing is discrimination against private companies and against FEDECAMARAS which do not have access to these public funds. Consequently, as has been emphasized on various occasions  the national industrial stock fell by  per cent between  and , according to the National Institute of Statistics (INE). Since , no official figures on company closures have been published, but it is estimated that it is over  per cent. The intention to replace private companies with socialist enterprises is a fact. The former are being strangled by legal constraints and requirements, while the latter are promoted and obtain preferential credits, although without obvious results. They only contribute  per cent of the country s GDP'  In the ten years since Mr Hugo Chvez came to power, the number of companies in the country fell from , to ,. Furthermore, a World Bank report early in  warned that the collapse of private activity in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would increase the prospect of negative economic growth and that  the lack of cooperation' between the private and public sector was a key factor in the collapse of economic performance in .Expropriations of private sectorassets and property
.The IOE and FEDECAMARAS highlight that in the last few months, the Government has multiplied attacks against the private sector, issuing numerous expropriation orders against companies without the slightest legal justification and without any financial compensation. In this regard, on  June , President Chvez declared  economic war' on the business sector and its representatives, especially FEDECAMARAS. He added  I declare myself in a state of economic war. Let s see who comes out on top, you bourgeois trash or those who love their country' 
.It should be emphasized that recently, on  October , the company Agroislea SA, which is crucial to the agriculture and livestock industry of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the chief distributor of farming products with  sales outlets and eight silos across the country, was nationalized. The order for the expropriation of Agroislea was widely rejected by producers and company workers. In Barinas, the state police used teargas to disperse a protest by  producers. After this action, one producer was arrested and injured.
.On  October , an order was approved for the expropriation for the Venezuelan subsidiary of the United States company, Owen Illinois, the world leader in the manufacture of glass containers for drinks, food, medicines and cosmetics.
.On  October , President Chvez ordered the expropriation of the Siderrgica del Turbio (SIDETUR), a subsidiary of the private Venezuelan steel group SIVENSA, and six urban complexes were paralysed and a further eight were  temporarily occupied' 
.The announcement concerning Owen Illinois brought the number of expropriated companies in  to , most of them without any compensation. In ,  companies were expropriated, not including companies in the agricultural sector. As highlighted by the firm Eco-analtica and the Venezuelan American Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VenAmCham), nationalizations and state takeovers worth $, million have been ordered since , but only $, million have been paid in compensation, representing one third of the expropriations. The pace of takeovers of private companies by the Government without compensation has been accelerating in recent months. In the last three years, the Venezuelan Government nationalized  companies in strategic sectors such as electricity, banking, cement, steel, oil and food. Of this total, half were taken over between January and August . The exponential number and headlong rush of expropriations without compensation by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is seriously endangering the viability, development and national output in key sectors of the economy, which as well as causing heavy economic losses also generates unemployment and poverty across large swathes of the population.Deaths and abductions of producersand cattle breeders
.As a result of the constant confiscations of companies and properties, there have been many acts of violence and abductions in the agricultural and livestock sector. A special case is that of the agricultural and livestock farmer, Mr Franklin Brito, who died aged  years on  August , as a result of going on a succession of hunger strikes since  July  in protest against the Government for the invasion and expropriation of his land and despite having produced to the Government the maps and documents proving his ownership of the property situated in Bolvar State. The farmer was demanding the return of his land and payment of compensation for damages. Sadly, this was not achieved even when, after his death, the highest authorities published documentation recognizing his rights in the media.
.The policy of harassment of the private sector has now resulted in  agricultural and livestock farmers being abducted without the Government being concerned to bring about their release. Since , the State has occupied  million hectares of land, rejecting titles of ownership.
.The IOE and FEDECAMARAS once again deplore the lack of social dialogue and bipartite and tripartite consultations, although the Committee has incessantly emphasized  the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation'  Despite the Committee s recommendation that  requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations'  it should be noted that the Government s attitude has not changed and that it is adopting reforms and laws which affect the private sector without prior consultation or social dialogue with the social partners.
.The IOE and FEDECAMARAS emphasize the Government s rejection of the Committee s recommendations on the matter and the absence of any  social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations'  On the contrary, the Government is now using the procedure of decrees with the force of law, which do not have a time limit, to legislate without dialogue or consultation, since with this type of instrument it is not necessary to discuss draft legislation in the National Assembly.
.For example, there was no social dialogue or consultation by the Government in the following cases:Fixing of the minimum wage. As reported many times to the various ILO supervisory bodies, the Government has been fixing the minimum wage unilaterally for ten years, without tripartite consultation or convening the National Tripartite Commission on the Minimum Wage, established by articles  and  of the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
186,"Organic Labour Act, and despite the observations of the Committee and the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations on the application of ILO Convention No. .The Public Procurement Act, approved on  August , which gives greater powers to the public administration in the award of contracts for institutions which use public funds. The employers' side expressed its concern that the reform of the law applies the seizure or requisition of assets in the case of alleged failures or halting of the works, without any opportunity for considering the right to defence.The General Banking Act, approved on  August , whereby shareholders, directors, staff and managers of the communication media are disqualified from exercising a financial activity, thereby openly violating article  of the Constitution which provides that anyone may engage in the productive activity of their choosing.Land and Agrarian Development Reform Act, approved on  August , under which producers lose their protection against procedures for expropriation of their lands without compensation. Venezuelan businessmen reject the legal practice of  recovery of lands' which is applied arbitrarily by the law enforcement services and the INTI, taking over estates and destroying tools and crops.The Labour Stability Bill which envisages that employers have the obligation to obtain prior authorization from the labour authority to terminate the employment relationship with any of their workers, which, due to the country s actual economic crisis, has led to the closure of thousands of companies.The Social Property Bill. The Government may order compulsory acquisition if it is determined that a company s productive activity is not aimed at satisfying real needs or it is not in conformity with national interests and the socio-productive model.The International Cooperation Bill which seeks to control the registration and financing of NGOs in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.The Organic Act establishing the Central Planning Commission was approved by the National Assembly on  April . The objectives of this Act include accelerating central planning and drawing up a central map of the national public and private economic structure, which implies defining plans for both sectors. Subsequently, on  May , the Act to Reform the Organic Act establishing the Central Planning Commission was approved, a measure which constituted an unprecedented threat against economic freedoms. The private sector, in common with its representative organization, FEDECAMARAS, was never consulted on these laws.
.Article , which sets out the aims of the Commission, provides that it shall carry out its functions with a view, among other things, to:  driving the transition to an integrated central planning model ...' and  guide the establishment of a model capable of ensuring satisfaction of the spiritual and material needs of society, achieving the utmost social happiness, in other words, the socialist model'  It is a clear abuse that individual decisions taken by economic agents in the exercise of their rights may be challenged by third parties, i.e. by members of the Central Planning Commission.
.Article  sets out the Commission s powers, indicating that its responsibilities shall include  drawing up a central map of the national economic structure, state, public and private, which will serve as the basis for planning and controlling the construction of the Venezuelan socialist model'  Consequently, the officials appointed by the President of the Republic as members of the Commission will determine the structure of the national economy. This administrative determination of the structure of markets and economic sectors is a threat to economic freedom and disregards the reality of many sectors, in particular the dynamic and endogenous nature of market structures. The scope of this power granted to the Commission is in clear conflict with the economic freedoms enshrined in the Constitution and the social model of the market.
.Article , paragraph , reads as follows:  To link and coordinate mechanisms for the exchange and distribution of national production, based on the needs of the people and the actual costs of production by branch, sector and productive unit, to fix fair prices'  The lack of any definition of those who will be responsible for this function is another clear infringement of the National Constitution and the economic framework and model indicated therein. Indeed, central planning of this kind not only makes free initiative impossible and reduces the positive effects of dynamism and innovation, but it also damages consumer freedom of choice.
.For all the above reasons, it is clear that the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, by its destructive attitude to social dialogue and its campaign of constant and violent harassment of the private sector, wanted once again to destabilize the country s employers' representative institution, FEDECAMARAS, by means of constant serious harassment of its members, business leaders, and attacks on their persons and properties. On the other hand, once again demonstrating its constructive approach, FEDECAMARAS expressed its optimism for the results of the parliamentary elections of September , hoping that the composition of the new National Assembly from January  would send a message of confidence to national and foreign investors, so that they would return to the country. It also stated that the expropriation and control measures had seriously damaged businesses, and that the situation needed to be reversed. The IOE and FEDECAMARAS again request the Committee on Freedom of Association to reach a decision on this Case No. , which is extremely serious and urgent, urging the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to accept the tripartite missions of direct contacts requested by the various ILO supervisory bodies, to cease its practices that violate freedom of association, to permanently cease attacking the employers' representative institutions and begin a dialogue with them, to take specific measures to show their will to comply with the international agreements to which they subscribed voluntarily, to accept and fulfil the recommendations of the ILO supervisory bodies; and to protect business leaders and their institutions from the violent attacks that they frequently suffer from armed gangs and that the latter should be tried and held responsible for their acts.
.In its communication dated  February , the IOE provided additional information concerning the cases of confiscation of property of employers' leaders, the alleged physical attacks against employers' leaders and the lack of consultation and social dialogue, as well as other questions.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states in relation to the allegations concerning social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS that in January , the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour and Social Security sent communications to the employers' organizations, including FEDECAMARAS, inviting their opinion on the fixing of the national minimum wage for . The majority of those organizations replied, sending their observations on the national minimum wage to the Department of Labour and Social Security. The National Executive, having heard the views of the employers' and workers' organizations and the relevant bodies, ordered the national minimum wage to be increased by  per cent in .
.Meetings, consultations and discussions were also held with employers; and workers' organizations, including FEDECAMARAS, concerning the Food Act and its regulations, the regulations pursuant to the Organic Act on Occupational Safety and Health and the Workplace Environment, the new Organic Labour Act, measures on labour immobility and principles of the representativeness of the country s employers' and workers' organizations in , , , ,  and .
.Consultations were also held on many other laws not related to social and labour matters. Large, medium-sized and small enterprises, the urban and rural sector, workers' representatives, communities, etc., took part in all of these, including representatives of FEDECAMARAS which, as one of the country s employers' organizations, like others, was invited to consultations, discussions and dialogue on various subjects.
.Furthermore, meetings were also held for the appointment of the tripartite delegation to attend the last International Labour Conference, in which the following employers' organizations took part: the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Manufacturers' Associations (FEDECAMARAS); the Venezuelan Federation of Craft, Micro, Small and Medium-sized Business Associations (FEDEINDUSTRIA); Entrepreneurs for Venezuela (EMPREVEN); the Bolivarian Council of Industrialists, Entrepreneurs and Micro-entrepreneurs (COBOIEM) and the National Confederation of Farmers and Stockbreeders of Venezuela (CONFAGAN). At these meetings, the representatives of these organizations also discussed subjects of economic, political and social interest in the country.
.On a separate matter, by Presidential Decree No.  of  January , published in the Official Gazette No.  on  January , the Constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela created the Bicentenary Fund, through which the national Government is promoting strategies to stimulate selective import substitution and the country s export sector, through collaboration between workers and entrepreneurs in the productive sector of the economy, both under private and public ownership, in close coordination with governments, municipal and local authorities, with the firm commitment to satisfy the basic needs of the people by developing the national productive system.
.This new initiative by the national Government complements others which, for some years past, have been designed to support initiatives in the business sector which generate economic sovereignty and social",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
187,"wellbeing. Considerable financing for such initiatives has been channelled through the public bank on preferential terms.
.At national level, representatives of various productive areas in the private sector participated in the socialist productive forums initiated by the national Government on  January . Many of those representatives were related to FEDECAMARAS, which confirms the participation of the latter and other employers' organizations in the inclusive, constructive and productive social dialogue promoted by the national Government to facilitate and strengthen the country s development based on the articulation of the public and private sectors of the economy.
.An initial review of the results, in January , showed , import substitution business projects and  export business projects. In percentage terms, the projects presented included  per cent in the agricultural sector,  per cent in textiles,  per cent in food and  per cent in tourism and services, all of them private enterprises.
.As regards the reform of the Organic Labour Act, last year and in the first months of , intensive consultations were held on the reform of the Act and its most important aspects. The debate began in June, with meetings being held in almost all sectors of the national economy. Representatives of all the employers' organizations, trade union confederations, federations and individual trade unions took part in these consultations. In addition, meetings and workshops were held both in the national capital and the various states of the country. By this process, the Social Development Commission of the National Assembly received over , proposals from all the interested parties. During the first few months of this year, the process of public consultation continued with the participation of all the social sectors, employers' organizations, workers' organizations and other people s organizations.
.The Social Development Committee of the National Assembly is examining the observations and proposals made by the public institutions and social partners. The Organic Labour Act Reform Bill is will soon have its second reading in the National Assembly in accordance with the legislative agenda.
.In addition, the National Assembly website also contains a forum, available to all workers, employers and citizens, on the Organic Labour Act, which is a space opened by the Permanent Social Development Committee to debate and consult on this reform.
.The Reform Bill has been widely discussed and debated, as part of the process of  street social parliamentarianism' being developed by the Venezuelan State through the National Assembly, to allow workers, employers and their organizations, as well as interested citizens and social institutions to make proposals and suggestions to enrich this legislative initiative which represents a great advance in the social, labour and restitution rights of the workers, and designed to achieve the maximum consensus possible.
.As regards the proceedings at the La Bureche estate and the situation of Mr ngel Eduardo Gmez Sigala, the Government states that it duly informed the Committee that the National Land Institute, an agency of the Ministry of Popular Power for Agriculture and Land, duly authorized in accordance with the law, initiated the procedure for recovery of the plot of land known as the La Bureche estate, in the parish of Cabudare, municipality of Palavecino, Lara State, with the basic objective of promoting the agricultural use of the Ro Turbio valley by immediately working the said land because it was lying idle. This was fully in conformity with the provisions of the National Constitution, the Land and Agrarian Development Act and Decree No.  of  December , published in the Official Gazette, No.  of  December .
.Furthermore, inspection of this estate showed that the farm was underutilized, since it grew crops that were not suitable for the type of soil, thus causing a process of degeneration, and there was also inadequate management which had an adverse environmental impact and  hectares out of the farm s total area of  hectares (, m) were left idle.
.Thus the proceeding carried out in the Ro Turbio Valley in Lara State was part of a process of recovery of lands and properties by the national Government and implemented by the National Land Institute, based on fallowness, lack of productivity or illegal use of land, as laid down in Venezuelan legislation.
.As regards the situation of Mr ngel Eduardo Gmez Sigala, the Public Prosecutor s Office charged him, having apprehended him in the act, with the offences of resisting authority and minor personal injury, as laid down in articles  and , respectively, of the Venezuelan Criminal Code. Mr Sigala was charged by Public Prosecutor s Office  in Lara State. On  September , the Eighth Lara State District Court, on the application of the Public Prosecutor s Office, ordered the application of the ordinary proceedings and release on conditional bail, as laid down in article , section  of the Criminal Procedures Code. The Public Prosecutor s Office requested the San Juan and Barquisimeto branches of the Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigation Service to carry out physical tests on a sample of clothing, verification of three compact discs provided for the defence of the accused, photographic records, technical inspection and interviews of witnesses in person, in order to prepare a report of its conclusions. The subsequent judicial proceeding against Mr Sigala is subject to all the procedural guarantees and rights set out in national and international law, and is based on compliance with and total application of the provisions of national legislation. Lastly, it should be noted that Mr Gmez Sigala is at liberty during the proceedings and all his constitutional rights and guarantees have been respected.
.As regards the allegations relating to labour solvency, the Government states that during the coup d at , the employers' strike with mass closures of companies and sabotage of oil production in  in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, many private sector entrepreneurs belonging to FEDECAMARAS were responsible for the economic losses and involved in attacks on democracy, using dismissals and violation of rights to punish the working class. That is why, at the beginning of , the workers' side, organized in the National Workers' Union in order to seek tools to guarantee their rights, presented the draft decree on labour solvency to the national Government. This initiative by the workers was widely discussed, and the decree was approved by the national Government to safeguard the social and labour rights of the country s workers and their families.
.The labour solvency certificate is an administrative document issued by the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour and Social Security, which certifies that the employer effectively complies with the human, labour and social rights of its workers. It is an essential requirement for employers which wish to conclude contracts and agreements with the State in the financial, economic, technological, international trade and foreign exchange areas.
.The labour solvency scheme has broad and sufficient guarantees of legality and impartiality for all those who apply for it. It also has simple, fast procedures. It is thus very far from restricting or threatening the free operation and development of companies and commercial activity in the country, or limiting the production and marketing of goods and services. Much less is it a mechanism of discrimination against employers. On the contrary, it is an effective means of guaranteeing and protecting the human, social and labour rights of workers which, for a long time, were at risk. The procedure is also subject to transparent mechanisms of social supervision.
.Employers which comply with the law, contracts of employment, respect the workers and maintain satisfactory conditions of safety and health in the workplace have no reason to be concerned that they will not duly and efficiently obtain the labour solvency certificate.
.With respect to the incidents which occurred in February  at FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Government states that it informed the Committee that, according to the information provided by the Public Prosecutor s Office, the police investigation related to the detonation of the explosive device at FEDECAMARAS headquarters and the case against Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Ms Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, who were suspected of committing the offences, was conducted in May . Their arrest was also ordered in , and they thus became fugitives from justice.
.The Prosecutor s Office also reports that, on  and  May , law enforcement officers arrested the accused, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Ms Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, respectively, on suspicion of committing the acts which occurred at FEDECAMARAS headquarters. The Public Prosecutor s Office requested the application of the ordinary procedure and remand in custody, which was granted by the court, and the said citizens were held in a remand centre in the metropolitan area of Caracas. The current stage in the proceedings is that submission of the final report is pending, according to official information provided by the Prosecutor s Office.
.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Government categorically rejects the Committee s suggestions that the fact that until a few days ago the accused citizens were fugitives from Venezuelan justice constituted a situation of impunity, as that would be a denial of",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
188,"justice and a lack of will to punish offences. The Venezuelan State, through its competent authorities, carried out all relevant investigations and made every effort to find the accused as quickly as possible, to ensure the fulfilment of the provisions of the law and the application of the principles and values of the rule of law and justice. Thus, even though those citizens could not be arrested, the Committee is not entitled at this stage to find that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is a State of impunity.
.As regards the alleged events in May and November  at FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Government states that the competent authority, in this case the Public Prosecutor s Office, informed the Department of Labour and Social Security, that no complaint or information had been received which would give rise to investigation into any incident at the headquarters of that employers' organization during .
.As regards the request to quash the order for the arrest of Mr Carlos Fernndez, the Government reiterates what it said on other occasions to the Committee concerning the constitutional principle of the separation of powers in the Venezuelan State. This separation of powers seeks to distribute and organize the functions of the State in which the powers of each are granted to a separate public body or organization. This, together with the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, is one of the principles that characterize the rule of law and justice in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.The Venezuelan Constitution of  establishes rules of institutional control and balance, by setting limits on the exercise of power and the guarantee that the bodies which hold those powers keep within their legal framework. Thus, public bodies are constrained to carry out only those activities which are assigned to them by legislation. This is where the principle of separation of powers is considered essential to ensure and safeguard the freedom of citizens, and by attributing the exercise of those powers to separate bodies, the power in the hands of each is limited.
.In the same vein, given that this principle applies in the Venezuelan State, it is the Public Prosecutor s Office which is responsible for investigating and examining the evidence in these cases, as well as all the related trial proceedings.
.The Government states that it is paradoxical that the Committee should request it to take steps to investigate and apprehend those suspected of the incidents which occurred at FEDECAMARAS headquarters, as requested in the last recommendations in the Committee s reports, and at the same time request it in this case to quash an arrest warrant issued by the Public Prosecutor s Office for the arrest of Mr Carlos Fernndez, who is accused of committing the particularly serious offences of civil rebellion and incitement to crime, established in the Venezuelan Criminal Code in articles , ,  and . These are offences with which he was charged on the basis of evidence that he committed those offences during the employers' strike and oil stoppage during  and  which were an assault on the rule of law and caused serious social harm and significant economic losses in the country.
.We cannot understand how the Committee on Freedom of Association can request punishment for some and absolution for others, when in both cases offences were committed which are specified and punishable under Venezuelan law and because they are punishable offences, warrant investigation to secure conviction in the case of guilt or acquittal if found innocent.
.The fact is that, in both cases, the suspects were identified and charged and the legal process was paralysed due to the obstruction of justice by the flight or absence of the accused, a situation which persists in the case of Mr Carlos Fernndez, who continues to be a fugitive from justice.
.We request and urge the Committee to show respect, impartiality and fairness in its observations and statements about our country, since persons suspected of committing an offence, whoever they may be, must be tried and punished if appropriate. The mere fact that he is a member of an employers' organization does not, in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, give Mr Carlos Fernndez any form of immunity in the case of the commission of criminal acts which, in this case, were public and notorious, as well as being particularly grave.
.The Committee should be reminded, when it requests the order for the arrest of Mr Carlos Fernndez to be quashed, that his participation not only in the incidents on the occasion of the employers' strike and oil stoppage but also in relation to the breakdown of the constitutional order by a coup d at in April , is public and notorious, which is why we wish to make some observations in this regard. Mr Carlos Fernndez was the Vice-President of FEDECAMARAS in  and was one of the participants in the coup d at suffered by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela against the Government of President Hugo Chvez on  April of that year.
.In December  and January February , Mr Carlos Fernndez, now President of FEDECAMARAS, was one of the promoters of the illegal employers' strike and oil sabotage, which had serious economic and social consequences for the country and its people, acts which led to his being charged by the Public Prosecutor s Office with the abovementioned offences.
.The illegal employers' strike and oil sabotage left the population without access to basic services and staple foods, a public industry with losses of over $ million, and forced hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprise in economic difficulty to close down permanently, leaving thousands of workers jobless, such that unemployment rose from  per cent in  to  per cent in June .
.Despite the investigations and proceedings opened by the Public Prosecutor s Office against the suspected participants in the incidents that occurred during the coup d at and the oil stoppage in December  and January February , on  December , the President of the Republic, in a magnanimous gesture, granted a presidential pardon to all those persons who, at that time, were within the law, had surrendered to the relevant criminal proceedings, and had been tried or convicted for offences during the coup d at, illegal employers' strike and oil sabotage, extinguishing in full all criminal, judicial, military and police proceedings initiated by the organs of State. This law and the pardon in question do not apply to the perpetrators of offences considered as in crimes against humanity.
.Mr Carlos Fernndez could have benefited from this pardon and amnesty. However, he was and still is a fugitive from Venezuelan justice. Consequently, because he did not surrender to the competent authorities with respect to the commission of the offences with which he was charged, he was not covered by the presidential pardon or Amnesty Act.
.Eight years have passed since  April , when the coup d at took place, and eight years have also passed since the illegal employers' strikes and oil sabotage. It is incredible, unfair and deplorable that international bodies, such as some of the ILO supervisory bodies, do not recognize these facts and repeatedly insist that they should fall under a cloak of impunity. The Government demands due respect and due impartial from the officials of the ILO supervisory bodies.
.In its communication of  November , the Government condemns and investigates any act of violence against persons living in the country. It therefore deplores and condemns what happened on  October  to Ms Albis Muoz and the FEDECAMARAS, leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas and Ernesto Villamil, as was stated publicly at the time by the Minister of Popular Power for Internal Relations and Justice, Mr Tarek El Aisami.
.The Government states that, as soon as the facts were known, the competent authorities of the Venezuelan State immediately launched an investigation in order to clarify what had happened, identify those responsible and bring them to trial, in accordance with national legislation. Once the results of this investigation are complete, they will be made public and the information will be duly published. Thus the  request for investigation' made by the Secretary-General of the IOE in the complaint of  November  is both tardy and superfluous, as the competent national authorities acted immediately as is right and proper.
.Given that the investigation into the incident is in progress, until the results are known, any speculative suggestion such as that expressed by the Secretary-General of the IOE is unjustified and not serious, when he indicates that ' .. purpose [of the attack] was to decapitate Venezuela s business leadership, although it was afterwards disguised as an abduction'  In this regard, the prejudiced and reckless speculations should at least not claim to be the real explanation of the facts, but deliberate and opportunist manipulation of an act of violence which we all deplored and condemned. It should be noted that the victims of this act of violence, all of them representatives of FEDECAMARAS, did not make an official complaint in the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
189,"Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela like the one filed by the official representing the IOE.
.Furthermore, due to the fact that the Secretary-General of the IOE states that ' .. none of the attacks on FEDECAMARAS have led to the arrest and punishment of those responsible, despite the fact that the names of the persons and institutions behind them are known'  we feel obliged to remind the Secretary-General of the IOE that the Committee of Freedom of Association was duly informed of the detonation in  of an explosive device at the Federation s headquarters, the investigation of which resulted in the arrest and trial of Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya and Ms Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, who were suspected of the attack. With regard to other attacks against FEDECAMARAS headquarters in  (not specified in the complaint in question), the Committee on Freedom of Association was also informed that, according to the Public Prosecutor s Office, there were no other current proceedings concerning an alleged attack or attacks on the headquarters of the said Federation. Thus, apart from the deplorable act of violence which occurred on  October , which is still under investigation, there are no complaints filed by representatives of FEDECAMARAS which are not being dealt with by the competent national authorities.
.Lastly, the Government categorically rejects the irresponsible, unfounded and false allegations with which, with impunity, they seek to link public institutions, even up to the highest representatives of the State, with acts of ' .. violence against Venezuelan business leaders'  as expressed by the Secretary-General of the IOE in his complaint. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is a deeply democratic state, based on the sovereignty of the people and a social state, governed by the rule of law and justice which was interrupted only during the coup d at which took place on  April  against the constitutional President, Hugo Chvez, when the then president of the leading business organization, FEDECAMARAS, took the Government Palace by assault and dissolved by decree all the public powers.
.The Government, once again, deplores the attempt to abuse the complaint mechanism, using it as a political stratagem to undermine the institutions of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, generate a web of adverse opinion and to manipulate the ILO s supervisory bodies.
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that, on  November , as a result of the investigations carried out by the competent authorities, two people, Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jaron Manjares, were arrested for their direct participation in the incident which occurred on  October (allegations of abduction and attacks on four FEDECAMARAS leaders). In addition a warrant was issued for the arrest of Mr Cristian Leonardo Castro Rojas, who is currently a fugitive from justice. The Minister of Popular Power for Internal Relations and Justice also reported that a further two persons are suspected of being involved, but they have not yet been identified with certainty and all of these people are members of a criminal gang engaged in robbery and abduction. The arrested persons are being tried in Caracas Metropolitan District Court . Finally, the Government provided additional observations in a communication dated  February , in response to the communication sent by the IOE on  February .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee notes that the Government states that there is no complaint pending with the Public Prosecutor s office and the representatives of FEDECAMARAS have not filed any complaint. The Committee deplores, whether or not there had been a complaint by representatives of FEDECAMARAS within the country, that the Government has ignored its recommendation to step up the investigations into these attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in May and November . The Committee requests FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint concerning the alleged facts of the attacks on its headquarters in  with the Public Prosecutor s Office and hopes that the authorities will collaborate with the organization s representatives to clarify the facts, identify and convict the guilty persons.(c) As regards the allegation concerning the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee firmly hopes that the authors of the bomb attack at FEDECAMARAS headquarters will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(d) The Committee deplores the lack of observations on the alleged abduction of  agricultural and livestock farmers and the death of one farmer (Mr Franklin Brito) as a result of going on a succession of hunger strikes in protest against the Government for the unjust invasion and expropriation of his land. The Committee emphasizes the seriousness of these allegations, requests the Government to reply to them without delay, and to make every effort to secure the release of the  abducted agricultural and livestock farmers and should order investigations to be carried out to punish the guilty persons. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(e) In general, taking into account the series of allegations examined in this section, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(f) With respect to the allegations of intimidation and harassment of FEDECAMARAS and its leaders, including the invasion and expropriation of farms or companies (in many cases without payment of due compensation) to the detriment of leaders or members of FEDECAMARAS, criminal prosecutions of employers' leaders and verbal attacks by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and its leaders, the Committee deplores that the Government has not replied to these allegations and requests it to send detailed observations without delay. The Committee reiterates the principle expressed in the previous paragraph and expresses the firm hope that in the future the authorities will refrain from adopting such an aggressive tone in their statements concerning FEDECAMARAS and its leaders and members, and that these allegations of unjust invasions, expropriations and prosecutions should be investigated.(g) The Committee deplores that the Government has not explained in detail the circumstances of the specific events which resulted in the criminal charge and trial of employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and requests it to do so and to keep it informed of developments in the trial. The Committee once again requests the Government to return the  La Bureche' farm property to the employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala without delay and to compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm.(h) The Committee once again requests the Government to quash the order for the arrest of the former President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Carlos Fernndez, so that he may return to the country without fear of reprisals, given the lack of significant progress.(i) The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations concerning social dialogue:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
190,"that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.(j) The Committee requests the Government to indicate the means of recourse available to employers who feel that they are victims of discrimination involving refusal to issue a labour solvency certificate or official foreign exchange authorizations, to initiate a dialogue with FEDECAMARAS on these questions and to inform the Committee of developments.(k) The Committee observes with regret that the Government has not replied to the allegations of discrimination against FEDECAMARAS and its members concerning parallel bodies and organizations close to the Government. The Committee requests the Government to send without delay its observations on these allegations and wishes to emphasize that by favouring or disadvantaging certain organizations compared with the rest, governments can influence the attitude of workers or employers when they choose which organization they wish to join, which is incompatible with the principle contained in Convention No.  whereby public authorities must refrain from any interference which would restrict the rights enshrined in the Convention. The Committee therefore requests the Government to ensure equal treatment for all employers' organizations in the matter of financing of activities and not to discriminate against members of FEDECAMARAS.(l) With regard to the examination of the international cooperation bill, the Committee hopes that it will provide for rapid recourse in the cases of discrimination and that it will avoid interference by the authorities in access to foreign funds by workers' and employers' organizations.(m) The Committee notes the comments of the complainant organization concerning the Organic Act establishing the Central Planning Commission. In this respect, while the legislation establishes strong state intervention in the economy and national economic structure under the aegis of central planning in order to construct the Venezuelan socialist model, the Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide information on the relationship between the allegations and the violation of Conventions Nos  and .(n) The Committee notes the additional information sent by the IOE on  February  concerning the cases of confiscation of property of employers' leaders, the alleged physical attacks against employers' leaders, the lack of social dialogue, as well as other questions, and the Government s communication, dated  February , received two days before the Committee s meeting. The Committee will review these communications when it will next examine this case.(o) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to this case because of the extreme seriousness and urgency of the matters dealt with therein.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.Subsequently, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) sent new allegations in a communication dated  October . The Government sent new observations in communications dated  May and  October  and  March .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the allegations and matters pending in relation to the present case are as follows:- violence and intimidation with respect to employers' organizations and their leaders;- violations of the private property rights of numerous employers' leaders in the agriculture and livestock sector, including invasions, confiscations and expropriations of land without due compensation, and penal proceedings;- harassment of employers' leaders through hostile speeches made by the President of the Republic;- warrant issued for the arrest of former FEDECAMARAS President Mr Carlos Fernndez and ban on leaving the country imposed on  employers' leaders;- serious shortcomings in social dialogue;- interference from the Government in promoting a Confederation of Socialist Entrepreneurs and preferential treatment for the employers' organization FEDEINDUSTRIA; privileges granted by the State to social production enterprises; and- recent Organic Labour Act for the creation of the Central Planning Commission which would restrict the rights of employers' and workers' organizations and draft act relating to international cooperation.
.The Committee notes the Government's statements in which it objects: () to the fact that in the Committee's conclusions, disrespectful expressions such as ""pro-Government mobs"" have been used, with the legally and democratically elected Venezuelan system described as a ""regime""; () to the admittance of allegations that go beyond freedom of association and collective bargaining and impinge on matters of criminal law; () to the fact that the allegations are credited with a high degree of credibility, while the Government arguments and evidence are not accorded due validity.
.In this regard, the Committee points out that the expressions ""regime"" and ""pro-Government mobs"" appear in the allegations from the complainant organizations and that the Committee takes no responsibility for them, although it is obliged to transcribe them, just as it also transcribes not entirely complimentary statements from the Government regarding FEDECAMARAS.
.As to the assessment of the allegations and of the Government's reply, and the suggestion that allegations under examination go beyond the trade union sphere, the Committee wishes to recall that it comprises representatives from the employers', workers' and government sectors and that it adopts its conclusions and recommendations by consensus following extensive deliberations in full compliance with the rules governing its mandate, such that the evidence furnished by the Government was given due consideration at all times.
.In the Committee's view, its repeated recommendations are due not so much to a problem of recognition of the evidence supplied, but rather to the fact that in practice, the Government does not always furnish sufficiently precise or detailed information and refuses to implement certain recommendations, as will be seen with respect to the allegations concerning social dialogue.Social dialogue
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statements concerning previous conclusions in relation to serious shortcomings in social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS. The Committee notes once again the Government's statements to the effect that its social dialogue policy is inclusive and that exclusive rights are granted to it (FEDECAMARAS) without exclusion, discrimination or favouritism, while broad-ranging and inclusive dialogue takes place with workers' and employers' organizations and small and medium-sized enterprises at local, regional and national level. The Committee notes that in its reply, the Government makes frequent reference to the consultations carried out with workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee wishes to point out that the present case relates to shortcomings in social dialogue ""with the FEDECAMARAS confederation"", as found in its previous examinations of the case, and that the Government's observations lead to confusion, in that it often omits dates, mixes consultations by the Executive in the preparation of draft legislation with those carried out by the Legislative Assembly to discuss draft legislation and, above all, fails to make specific reference to the FEDECAMARAS confederation, instead mentioning ""consultations with workers' and employers organizations"" in general, ""with employers"", or ""with (all) social partners"". The Committee underlines that the complainant organizations make reference principally to the failure of the Executive to consult with FEDECAMARAS or to consultations held merely for form's sake and not in good faith, in relation to social and economic policy decisions and the preparation of draft legislation affecting FEDECAMARAS interests (some of which were prepared pursuant to an enabling act authorizing the President of the Republic to hand down decree-laws on economic and social issues).
.Aside from the generic references to consultations with employers' organizations in general, the Committee observes that the Government makes specific reference to consultations with the FEDECAMARAS confederation in  and , where it mentions that it has sent communications to employers' organizations, including FEDECAMARAS, in order to seek their views on minimum wages. Other consultations (invitation to engage in national dialogue or in connection with food and industry) have already been mentioned by the Government and date from some years ago. The",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
191,"Committee already learned some years ago of the consultations with FEDECAMARAS as part of the preparation of the draft Regulation of the Organic Labour Act and the reforms to the Organic Labour Act, as well as consultations with that organization on the food and agri industry sectors prior to . The Committee welcomes the fact that the Government indicates in its latest replies that the draft reform of the Organic Labour Act may be discussed in the Legislative Assembly and that it will also consult with employers' organizations (press cuttings making reference to participation by FEDECAMARAS representatives in these consultations of the Committee on Social Development of the Assembly are attached). The Government indicates, without going into further detail, that the decree-laws handed down pursuant to the enabling act have been the subject of broad-ranging consultations, including with employers' organizations.
.The Committee wishes to make very clear that there has been a failure to comply with the duty to consult with the FEDECAMARAS employers' federation if the Executive restricts itself merely to consultations with other employers' organizations, FEDECAMARAS organizations at the subnational level, specific employers' leaders at local, regional or national level or to employers' leaders from large, medium-sized or small enterprises. In this regard, the Government's reply does not expand sufficiently on the question of whether the consultations on the Organic Law on the Working Environment and job protection measures also involved the FEDECAMARAS confederation, nor does it mention the manner in which these consultations might have been conducted.
.In summary, the Committee finds that in specific terms, the statements by the Government show little in terms of recent consultations between government authorities and the FEDECAMARAS confederation. The Committee wishes to return at this point to the question of the alleged failure to accord due recognition to the evidence invoked by the Government. Firstly, the information furnished by the Government on dialogue and specific consultations with the FEDECAMARAS confederation is confused and indicative of very modest actions. Secondly, the Committee sees once again that the Government has failed to comply with its recommendations, which in principle seem a reasonable means of resolving the problem of the current shortcomings in the area of consultations.
.As an example, the Committee, in successive examinations of the case and with a view to resolving the problems in question, has made a series of recommendations calling for direct dialogue with FEDECAMARAS on each of the allegations and issues under consideration, to be done via the establishment of a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO to resolve the problems. Despite this, the Government does not even make reference to the abovementioned recommendation in its reply. The Committee stresses that the Government has also ignored its recommendation to establish a forum for social dialogue in accordance with the principles of the ILO, with a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations (the Committee even offered ILO technical assistance for this purpose). The Committee requested the Government to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages, as provided for in the Organic Labour Act, and the Government has similarly failed to act on this recommendation.
.In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that the Government's stated willingness to engage in inclusive and non-discriminatory dialogue including the whole social spectrum without distinction at local, regional and national level, has failed to materialize for FEDECAMARAS, the most representative employers' organization. For that reason, it reiterates its recommendations on social dialogue, as it did in its previous examination of the case. Finally, the Committee wishes to make clear that the consultations must take proper account of the representativeness of FEDECAMARAS and the workers' organizations and pay heed to their points of view, since this is the only means of ensuring that society's aspirations and expectations can be realized and that measures, policies and standards in the labour and social spheres are fully satisfactory from a technical standpoint. The Committee requests the Government to ensure, as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), that FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate in the Assembly that may affect employer interests, without any discrimination compared to other organizations. The Committee stresses once again that where bills submitted to the Legislative Assembly concern labour-related, social or economic matters affecting the interests of the most representative employers' and workers' organizations, it is important for these organizations to be consulted in advance so that consensual solutions can be found where possible.Attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters
.As to the Committee's recommendation concerning the attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements to the effect that: () pursuant to the Venezuelan Constitution of , there exist institutional checks and balances to ensure that public bodies are limited to undertaking only those activities assigned to them by legal order, this being an area where the principle of separation of powers is seen as essential in ensuring and safeguarding citizens' freedom, since power allocated to a series of bodies limits the power held by an individual body; () the Attorney-General of the Republic is competent to investigate and follow up these acts and others which may affect or disturb public order; () through the actions of this organ of the Venezuelan justice system, the State has carried out all the relevant investigations with a view to shedding light on the events that took place at FEDECAMARAS headquarters and that according to information from the competent prosecutor's office, this case is currently at the investigative stage; () according to information from the Common Crimes Department of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic, the criminal proceedings pertaining to the events at FEDECAMARAS headquarters, assigned case number C F--, are being handled by the Offices of the Prosecuting Attorney of the th and th districts of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas and are currently in the preparatory phase, while arrest warrants have also been issued for Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos and Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez, in order for them to be brought before the jurisdictional court and formally charged; and () the police are engaged in an intensive search for the suspects in this case in order to bring them to justice. The Government indicates in this regard that the Committee will be kept informed of progress and the outcome of this case.
.The Committee regrets to observe that the investigations mentioned by the Government relate solely to one of the attacks against the FEDECAMARAS headquarters and that the two suspects have still not been arrested. The Committee requests the Government to allocate further resources to the Office of the Public Prosecutor and the police to enable the perpetrators of the attacks to be identified, tried and sentenced in line with legislation. The Committee stresses that this type of criminal behaviour is likely to generate a climate of fear, which is highly prejudicial to the exercise of the rights of employers and their organizations enshrined in Convention No. . In view of the lack of progress in relation to these attacks, the Committee reiterates the recommendations and principles set forth in its previous examination of the case and once again requests that further light also be shed on the attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters of May and November  and February  (the latter involving a bomb). The Committee expresses its deep concern at this series of attacks and observes that they have effectively resulted in a situation of impunity that is incompatible with the provisions of Convention No. .Warrant for the arrest of the former president of FEDECAMARAS
.As to the recommendation concerning the warrant for the arrest of the former president of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Carlos Fernndez, the Committee wishes to point out to the Government that the substance of this matter has already been examined by the Committee and that the information furnished by the Government was taken into account when it was concluded that the arrest of this employers' leader was related to his activities as an employers' leader, in connection with a long nationwide strike and a general strike. Furthermore, as reported by the Government, this leader was arrested, with the Court of Appeal subsequently handing down a ruling on  March  releasing the abovementioned citizen (who left the country) and withdrawing the charges against him. Following this decision, Ms Luisa Ortega Daz, at that time the Sixth Prosecuting Attorney of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, which handed down a ruling ordering that Mr Carlos Fernndez be placed once again under house arrest. The Committee recalls that Mr Carlos Fernndez left the country following the ruling withdrawing the charges against him. The Committee reiterates its recommendations seeking to ensure that Mr Carlos Fernndez be allowed to return to the country without the risk of reprisals.
.As to the alleged ban on leaving the country imposed on  employers' leaders, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement to",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
192,"the effect that the complainants have failed to supply adequate information or grounds to determine whether these alleged acts indeed took place. The Committee is therefore asked to request the complainants to furnish the evidence necessary to enable the Government to reply in relation to this allegation. The Government indicates that it has not prevented, nor will ever prevent any person from leaving the country, since it is the responsibility of the criminal justice system to decide whether to impose a ban on leaving the country, through a judicial measure and in accordance with the appropriate procedure. The Committee invites the complainant organizations to provide additional information concerning their allegations.Violations of the property of employers' leaders and harassment of employers' leaders
.As to the recommendations concerning violations of private property suffered by employers' leaders in the agriculture and livestock sectors, who were victims of invasions, land confiscation or expropriation, sometimes even without fair compensation, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements and of its measures to bring about agrarian reform and eliminate the system of large estates. More specifically, the Committee notes that in connection with the alleged measures taken against the employers' leaders, Mr Mario Jos Oropeza and Mr Luis Bernardo Melndez, as well as the alleged abduction of three sugar producers in , the Government indicates that according to information from the INTI of the Ministry of Popular Power for Agriculture and Land, no administrative proceedings have been brought in relation to acts that might compromise the personal safety of sugar producers, nor do there exist expropriation procedures for public, social or other purposes in which the abovementioned citizens were involved. However, the Government indicates that Mr Mario Jos Oropeza has lodged an application for the right to remain on his land with the Directorate of the Institute, and that this is pending discussion and approval; () as to the alleged deaths of six producers following attacks, as alleged by the complainants, the national Government reports that it is unable to offer an appropriate reply in view of the lack of documentation and information; () confiscation of land or any other property does not take place and is not permitted in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and that as to the allegations of farm invasions and other attacks that the complainants claim to have been suffered by various employers' leaders in the agriculture and livestock sector, such claims are groundless given that no information or evidence of such events has been supplied; and () in the event of a violation of their rights, the affected parties must bring their grievances before the competent body for settlement and remedy of the infringed right. In these circumstances, the Committee invites the complainant organizations to supply further details of the alleged violence against producers.
.In addition, the Committee takes note of the allegations of the IOE concerning: () the confiscation of the ""La Bureche"" farm property belonging to Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala (the director of FEDECAMARAS and former chairman of the Caracas Chamber of Commerce, the Venezuelan Chamber of Food, as well as the CONINDUSTRIA confederation) by officials of the INTI accompanied by military personnel as part of an operation to confiscate , hectares of agricultural land in the Ro Turbio Valley, in the course of which they destroyed  hectares of sugar cane due to be harvested in two months (the farm totals  hectares, of which six are pasture and two contain housing for the family, employees and some animals); and () the arrest of Mr Gmez Sigala and his transfer to the Barquisimeto Infantry Brigade before being brought before the Office of the Fifth Prosecuting Attorney of Lara State. According to the IOE, the Office of the Public Prosecutor, giving grounds for his detention, charged him with violence and resisting authority. The next day, the employers' leader was released on bail, with the obligation to appear before the Court or the Office of the Public Prosecutor whenever summoned or as required by the investigation.
.The Committee takes note of the statements by the Government, to the effect that: () confiscation of property or land does not take place in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and is forbidden, and the facts mentioned in the complaint relate to a programme of land and property recovery on the grounds that the land was idle, non-productive or in illegal use; the Land Act provides for the elimination of the system of large land estates and the Government has taken the measures necessary to do away fully with this regime; the Land Act has as one of its core principles the safeguarding and protection of food security and sovereignty; () in relation to the land in the Ro Turbio Valley, which for many years comprised large estates, which are prohibited by law and by the majority of the world's jurisdictions, the INTI granted a one-year grace period to allow the self-proclaimed owners of the land to prove their ownership; () in the absence of title deeds and given that the majority of this land fell below the productivity thresholds laid down in legislation or was being inappropriately used, the decision was taken to initiate the process of land recovery and thereby promote development of the agricultural sector and safeguard the interests of society; () with regard to the situation of Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, in the course of the valid legal procedure carried out at a number of properties in the Ro Turbio Valley, officials from the INTI and National Guard personnel encountered difficulties with this individual. According to notes taken during this procedure, the abovementioned citizen assaulted a member of the military, who suffered a dislocated shoulder. The injured person was, along with other personnel, carrying out his job of accompanying INTI officials and ensuring public order. In line with the appropriate established legal procedures, the Office of the Public Prosecutor subsequently charged Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, who had been apprehended in flagrante delicto, with committing the offences of minor bodily harm and resisting authority, pursuant to articles  and , respectively, of the Venezuelan Penal Code. The case was handled by the Fifth Prosecuting Attorney of Lara State, who brought the employers' leader before Supervisory Court No.  of that particular jurisdiction. The court authorized ordinary proceedings and granted bail, pursuant to article  of the Organic Code of Penal Process. As a result, Mr Gmez Sigala is required to appear before Supervisory Court No.  or at the headquarters of the Office of the Public Prosecutor whenever summoned and as required by the investigation currently being carried out by the abovementioned Prosecuting Attorney of Lara State; and () in light of the above, it can be seen that the right to due process was fully guaranteed throughout the investigation and legal proceedings, and that these do not constitute ""personal harassment"".
.The Committee observes that while the law does provide for the recovery of land or property on the basis that it is idle, non-productive or in illegal use, and that the Land Act provides for the elimination of large land estates (associated in the legislation to an ""appropriate"" yield of less than  per cent), the Government has failed to make any reference to the statement by the IOE concerning the size of the farm owned by employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala ( hectares, which can hardly be considered a ""large estate"" in a country the size of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), or to the fact that far from being non-productive or idle, the farm in question had  hectares of sugar cane about to be harvested, six hectares of pasture and space for family and employee dwellings. Nor has the Government replied to the allegation that these  hectares of land were destroyed by the authorities. In these circumstances, and given that an important employers' leader within the country was concerned, the Committee cannot discount the possibility that the so-called ""land recovery measures"" to which he was subjected may have been motivated by his status as an employers' leader. The Committee underlines that such measures can have an intimidating effect on employers' leaders and their organizations and limit the free exercise of their activities, in violation of Article  of Convention No. . The Committee considers in any event that this land recovery has not been proven to be in line with the substance of the legislation and requests the Government to return the ""La Bureche"" farm property to the employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala without delay and to compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities.
.The Committee notes the Government's statements to the effect that Mr Gmez Sigala was arrested for attacking a member of the military, who suffered a dislocated shoulder and who was, along with other personnel, carrying out his job of accompanying officials of the INTI and ensuring public order. According to the Government, the Office of the Public Prosecutor charged Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala with the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
193,"offences of minor bodily harm and resisting authority and the judicial authority handed down precautionary measures (bail, according to the IOE) requiring him to appear before the court or at the headquarters of the Office of the Public Prosecutor when required.
.The Committee does not have a detailed list of the charges against Mr Gmez Sigala, nor of the context and circumstances in which the events took place, and requests the complainant organizations and the Government to provide additional information in this regard.
.As to the alleged harassment of employers' leaders through speeches given by the President of the Republic and the alleged thread to confiscate property on grounds of social interest, the Committee notes that according to the Government's statement, the President of the Republic has, on countless occasions, demonstrated and reiterated his openness to dialogue with all social partners, particularly the employers' sector. This is also the position of the organs and authorities of the Government currently in office, all of which gives little credence to this entirely groundless allegation. The Committee invites the complainant organizations to supply additional information concerning their allegations.Allegations concerning the discriminatory application of certain laws
.As to allegations concerning legislation on labour solvency, the Government explains that with a view to seeking methods or tools to guarantee the effective application of workers' rights, including protection against dismissal, the UNT tabled the proposal for the Labour Solvency Decree in early . The Government adds that labour solvency is not, nor has ever been, intended to jeopardize the economic development of enterprises or trade, let alone to limit the production and sale of goods and services.
.The Committee notes that according to the Government, labour solvency is an administrative document issued by the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour and Social Security certifying that the employer is properly respecting the human, labour and social rights of his or her workers. It is a prerequisite for any employer wishing to conclude contracts or agreements with the State in the areas of finance, economy, technology, international trade and in the foreign exchange market. The Government adds that this document can be obtained via a quick automated procedure on the Ministry's web site, www.mintra.gob.ve, which contains requirements and other information users will need when filing their application. The employers must sign up to the National Register of Enterprises and Establishments via the appropriate web page and must submit a set of documents concerning their enterprise. Once the request has been filed and the requirements met, the Ministry, via the relevant authorities, processes that request within just five working days. The employer can then collect the solvency document at the labour inspectorate of his or her legal domicile.
.The Committee notes also that according to the Government, as part of the streamlining of formalities within the CADIVI for the acquisition of capital, the solvency document is not required for a currency application, since verification of that document takes place after the application process, the aim of this being to speed up the process of currency applications and issuance.
.The Committee notes that according to statistics from the National Register of Enterprises and Establishments and Labour Solvency of the Ministry of Popular Power for Labour and Social Security, a total of , enterprises nationwide had registered between its creation on  March  and  March . The total number of labour solvencies processed during  was ,, of which , applicants, or  per cent, were solvent. So far in , , have been processed, of which , applicants, or  per cent, were solvent.
.As to the alleged presence within the CONSEVEN of two prominent government figures, as well as the preferential treatment given to FEDEINDUSTRIA in relation to procedures for obtaining foreign currency, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that: () under no circumstances does the national Government promote or intervene in the formation or operation of these organizations, let alone apply any kind of favouritism or interference in relation to any organization; and () there are no officials with any government role among the leaders of the Confederation of Socialist Entrepreneurs of Venezuela, and certainly no officials with customs or taxation responsibilities.
.As to the alleged preferential treatment accorded to FEDEINDUSTRIA in relation to the procedure for obtaining foreign currency, the Government reports that: () the procedure is the same for all enterprises and operates via an automated system accessible through the www.cadivi.gob.ve web site, which provides information and sets out the necessary requirements for obtaining currency without any kind of discrimination. This foreign currency administration mechanism has helped to address market fragility and volatility and combat the effects of the global crisis without impacting on employment figures and workers' wages; () any enterprises importing these essential products or irreplaceable supplies required by the country are given priority in obtaining foreign currency; () in addition, enterprises importing certain types of goods and duly authorized by the Ministry of Popular Power for Food have available the ""payment at sight"" procedure. One of the advantages of this system is a significant reduction in the time taken to authorize foreign currency and, with cash in hand, it is possible to obtain more favourable conditions for international market access, since the consignment is totally or partially paid for prior to nationalization of the goods; () Decree No.  of  June , published in Official Gazette No.  of  June , set up a further mechanism to streamline the acquisition of foreign currency for the import of capital goods, supplies and raw materials by the country's manufacturing and processing sector. This measure specifically involves an exemption from fulfilling CADIVI requirements for enterprises applying for $, in currency or less in order to import capital goods, machinery, parts or production materials; () many of the mechanisms and alternatives used to facilitate and streamline the process of obtaining foreign currency were the result of meetings and consultation between CADIVI authorities and representatives of the various employers' and manufacturers' organizations; and () this treatment is available not solely to the enterprises or industries within FEDECAMARAS, but also to any others requiring small sums of foreign currency for their imports. The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee believes that the procedure for acquiring foreign currency could potentially be used in a discriminatory fashion, as indicated by the complainants, and requests the Government to discuss this matter with FEDECAMARAS with a view to allaying any concerns and guaranteeing that legislation is not applied on a discriminatory basis.
.As to the alleged privileges granted by the State to social production enterprises, the Committee notes that according to the Government's explanation, these are simply ""economic entities dedicated to the production of goods and services in which work is accorded its own, unalienable and genuine value, where there is no workplace social discrimination of any kind, where there are no workplace privileges connected to rank, and where there is genuine equality between workers. They are based on participatory planning and are either state-owned, in collective ownership or a combination of the two"".
.According to the Government, the organization of workers into social production enterprises is the key to becoming a popular, community-based and productive economy whose aim is to produce the goods and services necessary to satisfy the basic needs of the whole populace, and it is for that reason that such enterprises are promoted by the Government. However, the legal status of these enterprises is simply that of a public limited company. In other words, from a legal perspective, there has been no change in their structure; rather, their production and distribution methods, social aims and purpose have been transformed.
.The Committee notes the Government's affirmation of its impartial and fair treatment of each and every employers' and workers' organization in the country, with no specific organization being accorded preferential treatment in the past, present or future, since this would be nothing short of a discriminatory action with no place in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which is governed by the rule of law, justice and equity. The Government states that it is unclear as to what the complainants are referring to in their allegations of privileges granted by the Venezuelan State to these social production enterprises. The Committee observes that the complainant organizations have not furnished the information requested concerning social production enterprises.
.In addition, the Committee requests the Government to inform it as to progress in the adoption of the draft act on international cooperation (which, according to the Government, is passing the second reading before the Legislative Assembly), the final version of which it trusts will contain provisions on rapid action in the event of discrimination. As to the allegation that the Organic Law establishing the Central Planning Commission restricts the rights of employers' and workers' organizations, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that it exists with the purpose of coordinating, consolidating, monitoring and permanently evaluating strategies, policies and plans, as per the provisions of the National Economic and Social Development Plan, and that it represents a",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
194,"step forward compared to, inter alia, the provisions of the Organic Laws Public Administration and Planning. It is noted that the Central Planning Commission works to ensure that organs and entities of the public administration act in a harmonized and appropriate manner, in line with national development in compliance with the human rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.The Committee invites the complainant organizations to supply additional information concerning the allegations of discrimination in relation to the abovementioned law.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations concerning social dialogue. Specifically:' Deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard.' The Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act.' Observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible.' The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.(c) The Committee observes that the two suspects wanted for the bomb attack on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters ( February ) have still not been arrested despite the time that has elapsed. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations and expresses its deep concern at the fact that the case relating to this attack has still not been resolved. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to step up the investigations, ensure that they are independent, clarify the facts, arrest the perpetrators and impose severe penalties on them to prevent any recurrence of such crimes. The Committee requests the Government also to step up the investigations into the attacks on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters which occurred in May and November , and conclude those investigations as a matter of urgency. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee again deeply deplores these attacks and recalls that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence. The Committee expresses its deep concern at this series of attacks and observes that they have effectively resulted in a situation of impunity that is incompatible with the provisions of Convention No. .(d) The Committee once again requests the Government to revoke the warrant for the arrest of former FEDECAMARAS President Mr Carlos Fernndez, so that he may return to the country without risk of reprisals.(e) The Committee invites the complainant organizations to supply further details concerning the alleged deaths of six producers and the abduction of three sugar producers in .(f) The Committee requests the Government to return the  La Bureche' farm property to the employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala without delay and to compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in the course of the property seizure. The Committee requests the complainant organizations and the Government to provide a detailed account of the charges against Mr Gmez Sigala, including the context and circumstances in which the events took place.(g) The Committee requests the Government to discuss with FEDECAMARAS issues relating to the application of legislation on  labour solvency' and the acquisition of foreign currency, with a view to allaying any concerns and guaranteeing that legislation is not applied on a discriminatory basis.(h) The Committee requests the Government to inform it as to progress in the adoption of the draft act on international cooperation (which is currently passing the second reading before the Legislative Assembly), the final version of which it trusts will contain provisions on rapid action in the event of discrimination.(i) The Committee invites the complainant organizations to supply additional information concerning their allegations of discrimination in relation to the Organic Labour Act establishing the Central Planning Commission and harassment of employers' leaders through speeches given by the President of the Republic.(j) The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (June )].
.Subsequently, the Government sent new observations in communications dated  June and  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue.

The Committee expresses its deep concern at the fact that the case relating",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
195,"to this attack has still not been resolved. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to step up the investigations, ensure that they are independent, clarify the facts, arrest the perpetrators and impose severe penalties on them to prevent any recurrence of such crimes. The Committee requests the Government also to step up the investigations into the attacks on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters which occurred in May and November , and conclude those investigations as a matter of urgency. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee again deeply deplores these attacks and recalls that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence.(f) The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent the information which it requested concerning other acts of violence against employers' leaders and allegations of violations of the private property of employers' leaders in the agriculture/livestock sector and repeats its previous recommendations, as follows:With regard to the allegations of: violations of the private property of several employers' leaders in the agricultural and livestock sector; victims of invasions; the confiscation of land or expropriation without fair compensation, frequently in spite of rulings made by the judicial authorities regarding the restitution of lands to their owners, the Committee once again requests the Government to respond precisely to the specific allegations made by the IOE, including those relating to the measures taken against employers' leaders Mr Mario Jos Oropeza and Mr Luis Bernardo Melndez, and the serious allegations regarding the abduction of three sugar producers in  and the death of six producers following an assault.(g) Furthermore, with regard to the alleged harassment of employers' leaders through hostile speeches given by the President of the Republic in which he discredits and disparages employers' leaders, threatening to confiscate their property on supposed grounds of social interest, the Committee once again requests the Government to provide its observations in this regard without delay.(h) The Committee once again requests the Government to examine directly with FEDECAMARAS how to ensure that the application of legislation relating to  labour solvency' is accompanied by adequate guarantees of impartiality and avoids all forms of discrimination with respect to employers or their organizations that do not endorse the economic and social policy of the Government.(i) The Committee once again requests the Government to send information regarding the ban on leaving the country imposed on  employers' leaders and to revoke the warrant for the arrest of former FEDECAMARAS president Mr Carlos Fernndez, so that he may return to the country without risk of reprisals.(j) The Committee notes the Government s statements denying any interference in the CONSEVEN but observes that those statements do not respond in detail to the allegations made by the IOE concerning the presence in the CONSEVEN of two prominent government figures, who even have responsibility for customs and taxation, and the preferential treatment given to the employers' organization FEDEINDUSTRIA (privileges in obtaining foreign currency) by comparison with independent enterprises. The Committee once again requests the Government to send precise and detailed observations on these allegations and reiterates the importance of the adoption by the Government of a neutral attitude when dealing with any workers' or employers' organizations, and to examine all the above areas of potential discrimination against employers or organizations belonging to FEDECAMARAS and to keep it informed in this regard, including with respect to the adoption of the draft act on international cooperation, the final version of which it trusts will contain provisions on rapid action in the event of discrimination.(k) With regard to the IOE s allegations concerning social production enterprises, with privileges granted to them by the State, the Committee once again invites the IOE to provide new information and clarification with respect to these allegations. The Committee considers that the provision of this information is critical if it is to pursue examination of this aspect of the case and requests the Government to ensure that it adopts a neutral attitude in its treatment of and relations with all employers' organizations and their members.(l) The Committee notes the IOE s allegations to the effect that the recent Organic Labour Act establishing the Central Planning Commission severely restricts the rights of employers' and workers' organizations and again requests the Government to respond to these allegations.(m) The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to this case due to the extreme seriousness and urgency of the matters raised therein.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )].
.The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) subsequently sent new allegations in a communication dated  February . The Government sent new observations in communications dated  February and  March .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it examined the case in November  , the Committee on Freedom of Association made the following recommendations on outstanding issues [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )]:(a)	overall, taking into account the seriousness of the allegations that show a climate of intimidation surrounding leaders of employers' organizations and their members, the Committee stresses its concern and emphasizes that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights are fully respected and guaranteed, and that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected;(b)	the Committee regrets the fact that the Government has ignored the recommendations made by the Committee at the last examination of the case, at which time it offered for the second time the technical assistance of the ILO to establish a system of labour relations based on the principles of the ILO Constitution and its fundamental Conventions, so that social dialogue could be consolidated and placed on a permanent footing. The Committee also requested that, as a first step, the National Tripartite Committee (as provided for in the Labour Code) be reconvened. The Committee reiterates these recommendations and suggests establishing a national, high-level joint committee in Venezuela with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations presented to the CFA in order to resolve problems through direct dialogue;(c)	as to the allegations concerning deficiencies in social dialogue, the Committee has emphasized the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by full and detailed consultations with the appropriate independent and most representative organizations of workers and employers. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to any bipartite and tripartite consultations with FEDECAMARAS and any negotiations or agreements with this central organization or its regional structures and to transmit the corresponding texts. The Committee also requests the Government to ensure that any legislation adopted concerning labour, social and economic issues within the framework of the Enabling Act be subject to real, in-depth consultations with the independent and most representative employers' and workers' organizations, while attempting as far as possible to find shared solutions;(d)	as to the allegations concerning the Labour Solvency Act and its application, the Committee requests the IOE to provide further information on the enterprises which have closed owing to this Act, the number of workers who lost their jobs and any statistics at its disposal. The Committee requests the Government directly to examine, with FEDECAMARAS, mechanisms ensuring that  labour solvency' certification is granted in an impartial manner. The Committee also requests the Government to transmit the outcome of the claim made by CONINDUSTRIA that the Labour Solvency Act is unconstitutional;(e)	with regard to allegations concerning () economic, monetary and foreign exchange policies which the Government considers are not within the competence of the Committee, and on which the complainants allege their use for discrimination purposes; () the other allegations that the Government also considers as falling outside the competence of the Committee (the arbitrary approach with regard to fiscal policy, negatively affecting enterprises whose heads have criticized the Government s policies; limitations placed on international cooperation funds; and allegations involving attempts to limit freedom of expression), the Committee requests the Government to respond in detail to the allegations concerning the questions referred to above;(f)	however, with regard to the allegations concerning the draft legislation which would involve the introduction of limitations concerning international cooperation funds (state intervention concerning donations and cooperation resources and assistance received by employers' organizations from public",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
196,"or private institutions), the Committee recalls that any assistance or support that an international trade union organization might provide in setting up, defending or developing national trade union organizations is a legitimate trade union activity, even when the trade union tendency does not correspond to the tendency or tendencies within the country; furthermore, trade unions (or employers' organizations) should not be required to obtain prior authorization to receive international financial assistance in their trade union or entrepreneurial activities. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that these principles are respected when the draft legislation in question is being elaborated and that the State will not intervene in the matter of donations and resources received by employers' and workers' organizations at the national or international level. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard;(g)	as to certain alleged restrictions to fundamental rights (the withdrawal of Canal , Radio Caracas Televisin s (RCTV) licence and Government threats that have led two channels to change their editorial line), the Committee recalls that the right of workers' and employers' organizations to express their opinions through the press or other social communication media is a fundamental element of freedom of association and that the authorities should abstain from unduly impeding its lawful exercise, and should fully guarantee freedom of expression in general and in particular that of employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that this principle is respected, in particular with regard to the communications media used by FEDECAMARAS. The Committee also requests the Government to refrain from all interference in the editorial line of independent communication media, including the use of economic or legal sanctions, and to guarantee through the existence of independent means of expression, the free flow of ideas, essential to the life and well-being of employers' and workers' organizations;(h)	as to the allegations of discrimination against FEDECAMARAS and its affiliated organizations, including the establishment or promotion of organizations or enterprises close to the regime such as, according to the allegations, the CESU or EMPREVEN, the Committee emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the Government adopts a neutral attitude when dealing with any workers' or employers' organizations, and requests the Government to respect the principles referred to in the conclusions;(i)	as to the allegations of: violations of the private property of several employers' leaders in the agricultural and livestock sector; victims of invasions; the confiscation of land or expropriation without fair compensation, frequently in spite of rulings made by the judicial authorities regarding the restitution of lands to their owners, the Committee requests the Government to respond precisely to the specific allegations made by the IOE, including those relating to the measures taken against employers' leaders, Mr Mario Jos Oropeza and Mr Luis Bernardo Melndez, and the serious allegations regarding the abduction of three sugar producers in  and the death of six producers following an assault;(j)	as to the allegations regarding limitations on employers' leaders' freedom of movement, recalling the importance that it attaches to the principle set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country, particularly when participation in the activities of organizations of employers or workers abroad is involved, the Committee requests the Government to ensure the freedom of movement of the leaders Ms Albis Muoz and Mr Carlos Fernndez and to take the necessary steps to annul the judicial proceedings and arrest order against Mr Carlos Fernndez so that he may return to the country without risk of reprisals. The Committee requests the Government to send information on the eight employers' leaders mentioned by name by the IOE whose freedom of movement is restricted, according to the allegations;(k)	as to the alleged harassment of employers' leaders through hostile speeches given by the President of the Republic in which he makes damaging remarks and disparages employers' leaders, threatening to confiscate their property on supposed grounds of social interest, the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations in this regard without delay;(l)	as to the allegations made by the IOE regarding social production enterprises with privileges bestowed upon them by the State, the Committee invites the IOE to provide new information and clarification on these allegations, and requests the Government to ensure a neutral attitude in treatment of, and relations with, all employers' organizations and their members;(m)	as to the serious allegations made by the IOE dated  May  that a pro-government mob forced its way into the head office of FEDECAMARAS, daubing graffiti, damaging property and making threats, the Committee stresses the Government s obligation to ensure that employers' organizations can exercise their rights in an environment free of fear, intimidation and violence and urges the Government to undertake without further delay an investigation with a view to identifying the guilty parties and to instituting legal proceedings so that they can be duly prosecuted and punished and thereby prevent the repetition of these offences. The Committee requests the Government to ensure the security of both the FEDECAMARAS head office and its leaders from now on and to inform the Committee on the outcomes of the investigation without further delay; and(n)	finally, the Committee requests the Government to transmit its observations in respect of the allegations of the IOE dated  October .
.In its communication of  October , the IOE states, in relation to its allegations concerning the creation of parallel entrepreneurial institutions promoted by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, that the interventionism of the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the country s entrepreneurial institutions has already been duly denounced in its communications of  March ,  April ,  May ,  March  and  May . The Government has shown further evidence of this interventionism in the following cases: () the Confederation of Socialist Entrepreneurs of Venezuela (CONSEVEN) ' since its creation, two prominent government figures have led this confederation: vice-president ' Mr Johnny Ynez Rangel, Governor for the state of Cojedes; economic advisor ' Mr Jos Gregorio Vielma Mora, Superintendent of the National Integrated Customs and Taxation Administration Service (SENIAT), the highest authority within the Ministry of Finance, and () FEDEINDUSTRIA ' the obtaining of foreign currency by enterprises, despite its abundance from petrol revenues, is subject to authorization and control by the Foreign Currency Administration Commission (CADIVI). On its web site, FEDEINDUSTRIA informs its members that, thanks to links with parts of the administration, it is privileged to be able to obtain currency without having to submit to the bureaucratically slow and discriminatory processes imposed by CADIVI on any independent enterprise.
.With regard to its allegations of attacks on freedom of information, the IOE recalls that, in , the International Labour Conference recognized, in its resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organizations must be based on respect for those civil liberties which have been enunciated in particular in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and that the absence of these civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights. The Conference declared that the civil liberties contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights, among them  freedom of opinion and expression and in particular freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers'  Freedom of information and expression is seriously threatened given that, since the closure of Radio Caracas Televisin (RCTV), the Government has begun to threaten the only independent audiovisual broadcaster remaining in the country, namely, Cadena Globovisin. The Venezuelan President, Hugo Chvez, has threatened this station with closure on several recent occasions. RCTV was the principal channel of expression for the private sector in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Its closure is a consequence of the socializing policies of Hugo Chvez, as demonstrated by his Vice-Minister for External Relations, William Izarra, on  January , when he said,  Our socialism requires hegemony of communications and all communications should, as public property, be dependent on the State.' Decree No.  of  May  created the Venezuelan Social Television Foundation (TEVES), under the auspices of the People s Ministry, which is financed principally, according to section , by the initial  per cent contribution allocated to it by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, together with whatever it may receive annually under the budget act. This is the station which has replaced RCTV on its television and radio broadcasting frequencies. No private or independent station was able to take over these slots. RCTV s assets were seized and confiscated without any compensation. RCTV was an essential medium for the free exercise of liberty by employers in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee on Freedom of Association must comment on these attacks on freedom of association and",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
197,"the removal of this essential means of freely exercising liberties.
.With regard to its allegations concerning persecution of employers' officials, the IOE states that, in December ,  Venezuelan citizens, among them  employers' leaders, were prohibited from leaving the country as of that date. They included the former President of FEDECAMARAS, Ms Albis Muoz. This step is only taken when there is evidence to link a person to a crime, or if there is a risk of a person absconding or obstructing an inquiry. On  February , Chamber  of the Caracas Appeal Court annulled the prohibition order on leaving the country. On  February a new chamber of this Court, designated to rectify the decision, even though it exceeded its jurisdiction, revoked the ruling given ten days before. On  February , at the Government s instigation, the Attorney-General, Ms Luisa Ortega Daz, had requested that the ruling be reviewed and annulled, and to that end new magistrates had been nominated. They decided to annul the original decision, thereby also annulling the prohibition on leaving the country. In addition, in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in accordance with its laws, no precautionary measure may exceed two years in duration. In April , therefore, Ms Albis Muoz' lawyers and those of the other employers' representatives requested that the precautionary measure be annulled, restoring to the employers' leaders their right to leave the country freely. The hearing requested for the purpose was arranged for October . This arbitrary management of judicial procedures, instigated by the Government, has prevented those concerned from leaving the country on numerous occasions, leaving them, in particular Ms Albis Muoz, as her country s Employers' delegate to the last session of the International Labour Conference, unable to defend the interests of employers and their organizations.
.With regard to its allegations of attacks on freedom of association and expression, the IOE states that, on  June , the Official Gazette published Decree No. , which had the status, value and force of an organic law establishing the Central Planning Commission. This Decree constitutes a new attack on freedom of association because it forces employers' and workers' organizations to submit any information which may be required to the Central Planning Commission (section ), under threat of sanctions, including intervention by the police (section ). This Decree, as its text states, seeks to promote the transition to a centralized planning model to create  a model which can guarantee the spiritual and material needs of society, achieving supreme social felicity, this is the socialist model' (section .). By means of this Decree a  new socialist state' is created, in which all institutions, including entrepreneurial organizations and trade unions, are subordinated to strategic political directions and national, regional, sectoral and international plans which, once approved by the President of the Republic, will be compulsory to follow (sections  and ). This requirement is a flagrant violation of Convention No.  and, most particularly, the principle that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict the rights of employers' and workers' organizations or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.With regard to its allegations concerning lack of tripartite consultation and absence of tripartite will, the IOE refers to the question of the minimum wage and states that, in addition to the fact that no tripartite consultation took place before the aforementioned Decree No.  was adopted, the lack of political will on the part of Hugo Chvez' Government to hold tripartite consultations should be highlighted. In this regard, the IOE wishes to draw the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association to the statements made by the Minister of Labour, Mr Jos Ramn Rivero, in which he states that no tripartite commission will be established for the purpose of fixing minimum salaries. (The last time the minimum wage was increased recently, notification was sent on the same day as it was published in the Official Bulletin.)  At this stage of the process, with the level of democratization that we have, we are not going to return to tripartism,' said Mr Rivero. Section  of the Organic Labour Act, in accordance with the provisions of the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), lays down that the basic salary shall be reviewed at least once a year by a tripartite commission, which has not been the case for the last eight years.
.The IOE also wishes to highlight the fact that, on  August , the draft organic act on labour stability was approved at its first reading by the National Assembly, without any tripartite consultation, despite being at odds with the provisions of the Termination of Employment Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), both of which have been ratified by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, on  May  and  June , respectively. The lack of consultation allowed this bill to be approved, in its current form, at its first reading.
.Convention No.  allows an employer to terminate employment for economic, technological, structural or similar reasons, provided that the competent authority is notified in advance and is given the reasons for the proposed terminations. Section  of the new draft organic act stipulates that, before a worker can be dismissed for economic or structural reasons, prior authorization from the competent authority is required.
.In its communication of  February , the Government raises an earlier point to draw the attention not only of the Committee on Freedom of Association but of the International Labour Organization as a whole to a fact which it has previously denounced, namely the strategy used by some employers to use the employers' sector for unworthy political aims. This situation made it necessary for its permanent mission to submit a complaint based on certain statements made to the press in its country. Among others, the following stand out:  the ILO is censuring the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for violating employers' rights'   the ILO is attacking Chvez for violating employers' rights' 
.In the face of such statements, the Government reiterates that it respects freedom of expression and information; however, in the name of these freedoms, the truth cannot be ignored or manipulated for other purposes. It seems a serious and delicate matter that the name of the ILO and its various bodies should be used for such ignoble ends. But more serious still is the fact that such statements coincide with the opinions expressed by an official of the ILO, who is of the following opinion:  However, the Chavista project is not only populist; it is, above all, an authoritarian political model, definitely unedited, heading towards totalitarian, if organized civil society, political parties, trade unions and social communication media, in general do not succeed in their role of stopping it'  [See Fundamentos de derecho sindical venezolano, , p. .]
.With regard to the IOE s new allegations of  May , the Government states that it wishes to draw particular attention to the fact that, in the document submitted by the Committee on Freedom of Association and approved by the Governing Body, the following phrase leaps out:' hordas progubernamentales atacan sede de FEDECAMARAS [translator s note: literally  ...pro-government hordes attack FEDECAMARAS headquarters .It is worrying that an official document submitted for consideration by the plenary was not drafted with care; quite the reverse, in fact. Before this document was approved, the interested parties gave press conferences at which they quoted from the report, using and manipulating the name of the ILO. The Government does not wish to blame the ILO for this situation in any way ' that would be irresponsible ' but it considers, without a shadow of a doubt, that keeping the above wording worked in favour of the interested parties' strategy; however, if we begin to analyse the scope of the argument (using the definition of  horda' given in the dictionary of the Real Academia Espaola) we find:  horde ' community of nomadic warriors ' group of people behaving without discipline and employing violence'  The Government requests the Committee to ponder this situation because one cannot help but note that, even in extremely serious cases where citizens of other countries have died as a result of violence simply for claiming their labour and social rights, no such disproportionate and inappropriate formulation has been used. It hopes that there will be no repetition of this situation, as it could compromise the seriousness of the Committee and therefore of the ILO.
.The Government also points out that, in recommendation (g), the Committee is not being truthful when it states:  the withdrawal of Canal , Radio Caracas Televisin s (RCTV) licence and Government threats that have led two channels to change their editorial line ' The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that this principle is respected, in particular with regard to the communications media used by FEDECAMARAS. The Committee also requests the Government to refrain",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
198,"from all interference in the editorial line of independent communication media, including the use of economic or legal sanctions  ?
.The Government emphasizes that it is public knowledge that the television channel mentioned above broadcasts its signal without any kind of restriction; this can be confirmed and is an irrefutable fact. It should be noted that this situation arose because of an orchestrated body of media opinion at national and international levels intended to make people believe that citizens' rights to freedom of expression and information were being violated and that the country was moving towards an  autocratic regime' 
.This false argument was demolished by recent events which took place on  December last year when, using his vocation and democratic qualities, which were proved beyond any doubt, the Constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, citizen Hugo Chvez, recognized the opposition s victory and invited them to work with him, following once more the democratic path. However, it is striking that the IOE has forgotten that the enterprise in question has been the subject of complaints to the Labour Administration Authority for violation of its workers' freedom of association; what is more, on one of its morning programmes, making use of its freedom of expression and information, it publicly attacked trade union organizations, which raises the question: why was a complaint of such magnitude not considered?
.Nevertheless, despite violations of legal and constitutional provisions, promotion of incitement to commit offences, ignoring the law and violating criminal legislation, and attacks against the provisions of the Organic Act for the Protection of the Child and Adolescent (LOPNA), which resulted in interventions in certain administrative proceedings and amparo (enforcement of constitutional rights) cases with a view to reversing the violation of constitutional provisions, the Government acted in accordance with the principles of a democratic State, as happens in every country in the world: it requested the enterprise to correct any violations, a request that the enterprise ignored. Bearing in mind, then, that the State is responsible for managing the radio frequency spectrum, and given that it was impossible to get any reply from the enterprise concerned, the Government proceeded, as has happened in many countries ' particularly in Europe ' without such a media frenzy, not to renew the enterprise s licence to broadcast on the radio frequency spectrum, the administration of which falls to the State, which means that these actions are legal.
.Furthermore, after all the fuss and media spectacle, the enterprise in question proceeded to dismiss countless workers so that it could then apply an obviously fraudulent labour process with the excuse of reducing its costs, attacking the working class by making monetary offers known as  happy meals' and thereby inducing a large percentage of workers to sign their dismissal papers. This practice constitutes mass dismissal for which the Government was supposedly responsible. This argument was wheeled out during the campaign to avoid the  proposed closure' 
.After all this, and following the closure, they mobilized all their technical legal resources and, with favourable rulings from the country s (autonomous and independent) courts, they returned to the airwaves with fewer workers and a considerable rise in profits. Attempts were made to involve some sectors of the organization in this process, and the Government knows that they may perhaps have acted in good faith, which is why it asks that it is this context ' and in no other ' that this argument presented to the Committee on Freedom of Association should be viewed, on a matter which, in Europe at least, is not at all controversial.
.For its part, the Government states that it is extremely concerned that it should be concluded, without any previous examination and without in-depth arguments, that the Government has threatened two media channels to make them change their editorial line. This constitutes a lack of respect for the heads (employers) and directors of the channels in question ' without naming them ' and could also be taken as an open attack on the sovereignty of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as a free and democratic country, as editorial lines are exclusively their concern within a social state of law and justice.
.Everyone knows that, in labour matters, the media are classed among enterprises with  leanings' ' or ideologies ' and receive special treatment based on the right they enjoy to change their editorial line. It is the case that no proceedings brought by any worker who has been affected or who considers that their rights have been violated by the change in editorial line of a communication medium are currently before the People s Ministry for Labour and Social Security.
.The Government is of the view that, in assuming a position on this matter, it would be pertinent and opportune to concentrate on how the communications media are characterized or classified, taking into account doctrine ' particularly labour doctrine ' in so far as it has a direct effect not only on the length of an employment contract but also on the termination thereof for reasons attributable to either worker or employer.
.Using this approach, there is a peaceful section of doctrinal opinion which is inclined to define and classify the media as being among those enterprises which have leanings or ideologies; furthermore, doctrinal opinion, jurisprudence and the entire positive Venezuelan legal system is inclined to favour such a classification and it is from this perspective that a discussion should be approached, recognizing at the outset what we are discussing in order not to make statements without adequate knowledge of a matter which could result in mistaken conclusions, unless ' intentionally ' one wished to misuse the issue for other ends.
.With the above, the Government hopes that debate will proceed within the Committee and that conclusions can be arrived at which much better reflect reality, as the Government maintains its principle that indifference towards matters of great importance is not the healthiest attitude, much less making a priori statements without any basis which contribute to distracting attention from the real interests being pursued by raising such matters.
.Using the same approach, German doctrine (which uses the term  leaning' and applies it quite widely) considers ideological enterprises to be those organizations which are geared towards achieving political, trade union, confessional, charitable, educational, artistic or similar aims and presuppose adherence to a particular ideology or conception of the world, generally known as a leaning, on the part of the workers within the enterprise.
.There is a section of Spanish doctrine which is of the opinion that  we can arrive at the conclusion that organizations with leanings are characterized in an international context as being the direct consequence and embodiment of constitutional recognition of political, trade union and religious pluralism, being directly and predominantly geared towards the public dissemination of a particular ideology, and being a channel for the expression of one of the fundamental rights of their owners, be they individual or collective' 
.Furthermore, and in order to define enterprises with leanings or ideologies precisely, the following criterion is established:  only those enterprises or institutions which aim to disseminate, propagate or indoctrinate people in the ideology which characterizes the parent organization may be considered clearly as enterprises with leanings. Only these institutions ' viz. channels for information and the expression of thought, schools, seminaries, centres for trade union training, etc. ' constitute a direct expression of political pluralism in themselves' 
.Finally, as far as this point is concerned the conclusions are alarming. They are dealt with lightly, without taking into account key aspects which would avoid the kind of outrages that compromise not only the Committee but also the Organization as a whole and which, in the short term, could, without any doubt, affect the impartiality and professionalism by which they should be characterized.
.With regard to the Committee s recommendations, the Government points out that in November  it announced the creation of a preparatory commission for the round table on participatory, inclusive and productive social dialogue due to take place on  January . The commission was suspended as a result of the atmosphere of conflict generated by the hostile attitude of workers and employers who, after pursuing a fierce campaign against the proposal for constitutional reform, the text of which provided for rectification of some matters which had been the subject of complaints to the ILO, resolved on destabilization using a strategy of shortages of foodstuffs considered to be of prime necessity. In other words, the attitude of some worker and employer sectors within the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is not consistent with what they denounce as true in international forums; however, acting of its own accord and in the hope of a proactive and positive attitude, the Government is prepared to bring them together once more.
.With regard to the Labour Solvency Act, the Government states that the purpose of and reason behind the Act stem from the evasive conduct of some employers with respect to legal contributions ' particularly in terms of social security",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
199,"' to the detriment of workers, which obliged the Government to fall back on this instrument to avoid such evasion, regulating in particular enterprises involved in contracts with the public sector by imposing on them the sole requirement that they be up to date and solvent with respect to the minimum requirements of Venezuelan legislation.
.Finally, with regard to the claim submitted by CONINDUSTRIA that the Labour Solvency Act is unconstitutional, the Government has no further details as the matter falls within the purview of the judicial authorities, but wishes to state that it will respect and comply with the decision taken in the matter; it hopes only for a similar attitude on the part of the claimants, without going into detail on the fact that, in the interests of not obstructing the right to free enterprise, the periods of validity for labour solvency documents for all enterprises in the food sector were recently extended. It does not surprise us that this extension is neither mentioned nor acknowledged by the employers in their complaint.
.With regard to economic and monetary policy in the currency market, the Government states that countless weekly meetings have been held between the CADIVI authorities and representatives of the various chambers of employers within the country. All these meetings have been characterized by the search for alternatives and for mechanisms to make the process of issuing preferential currency to obtain goods and services more fluid (minutes of meetings are attached). As regards the organization known as Socialist Entrepreneurs, the Government confirms that it does not meddle in the freedom of association that the various organizations of employers enjoy, and it cannot therefore be said that there is any preferential treatment, favouritism or interference towards one confederation or another. The Government denies that the Confederation of United Socialist Entrepreneurs of Venezuela (CESV) was formed under its auspices, and much less can it be said that it was intended to act as a substitute for any consultation with one entrepreneurial association or another, as under this Government people are neither excluded nor much less singled out. Furthermore, article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela states that every person has the right to association for legitimate purposes in accordance with the law and that the State shall be obliged to facilitate the exercise of this right. From this it can be seen that the right to association is a fundamental human right which has been promoted by our Government by elevating it to constitutional status.
.It is worth pointing out that, with this argument, the complainants could have tried to claim that this is an exclusive and discriminatory right which only they enjoy, which in itself is contrary to our legal system, and violates and contradicts the criterion of the Committee on Freedom of Association, which states:Article  of Convention No.  is designed to give expression to the principle of non-discrimination in trade union matters, and the words  without distinction whatsoever' used in this Article mean that freedom of association should be guaranteed without discrimination of any kind based on occupation, sex, colour, race, beliefs, nationality, political opinion, etc., not only to workers in the private sector of the economy but also to civil servants and public service employees in general [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ].
.With regard to the attack on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Government stresses that in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela there has been and will be no condoning of acts of violence against institutions or property. The complainant states that the demonstrators arrived in vehicles belonging to official bodies, and also states that the alleged leaders threatened the institution, allegedly with the tacit support of the forces of law and order (who allegedly did not intervene either to avoid or to halt the attack) without backing up their assertions. They merely attach a series of reproduced photographs which show alleged demonstrators but do not show that these demonstrators had arrived at the headquarters in vehicles belonging to official bodies, much less that they were acting with the tacit agreement of the state security forces.
.The complainant makes groundless assertions without any evidence. More serious still is the fact that, with its unfounded but well-presented arguments, it is trying to make use of this honourable Committee to try and obtain negative comments on the actions of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela when it is not within the mandate of the Committee to examine the  alleged attacks'  which, furthermore, were not reported to the competent authority, i.e. the Office of the Prosecutor General, in the proper manner. One could ask oneself whether the failure to report all the alleged events to the competent authorities (the Office of the Prosecutor General) is part of the confrontational strategy adopted by FEDECAMARAS.
.With regard to the alleged restrictions on freedom of movement imposed on FEDECAMARAS leaders, in its written submission the complainant states the following:The IOE further observes with concern that the Government prevented Ms Albis Muoz, Employer delegate and former President of FEDECAMARAS, from leaving the country to attend the International Labour Conference, which met in Geneva in June . The same occurred in the case of the ILO s American Regional Meeting in . The authorities cited fiscal, administrative and legal problems with respect to the Employers' delegate, instigated and reported by the Government itself. In this regard, the Government decided to include, as technical advisers within the Employers' delegation, Employer representatives, representatives of the Confederation of Socialist Entrepreneurs of Venezuela (CONSEVEN), who did not fulfil the criteria for representativeness recognized by the ILO, such as being a free and independent organization which is not subject to Government interference. Consequently, FEDECAMARAS was the only autonomous and independent employers' representative organization for the purpose of participation in the Conference ' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Government states that it has not prevented and will not prevent any person from leaving the country, as it is the criminal jurisdiction authorities (and here there is an evident and clear separation of powers) that are responsible for legal measures to prohibit or allow a person s departure from the country, so Ms Albis Muoz can hardly hold the Government responsible for any situation she may face with the criminal jurisdiction authorities or a People s Ministry of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.However, this situation was properly clarified in a communication sent to the ILO in January , which stated that Ms Albis Muoz could benefit from a decree dated  December  which provides for pardons to be granted to Venezuelans prosecuted in relation to crimes committed during the events of April  (coup d at). This decree did not cover Mr Carlos Fernndez as he was a fugitive.
.As regards the alleged absence of bipartite and tripartite consultation and social dialogue, it is important to reiterate, state and emphasize (as has been stated in previous communications to the ILO) that dialogue has been growing ever wider and more diverse, especially during  and . Over this period, national, regional and local governments have held innumerable meetings with FEDECAMARAS, as the various ILO monitoring bodies have been informed, including in this case the Committee on Freedom of Association. The President and Vice-President of the Republic, ministers and high-level officials participated in these meetings, which dealt with a variety of issues. In addition, more than  meetings were held over the same period with all the social partners, regardless of other consultations carried out in writing or by survey.
.This social dialogue, which includes meetings of the regional and sectoral chambers with national, regional and local authorities, is linked to a sovereign and popular government policy, which together have constituted key factors for economic growth over the past  quarters through lower inflation, lower interest rates, the reduction of certain taxes (for example, on bank overdrafts), lower unemployment with the reuse of almost the entire installed industrial capacity and growth of formal employment, thanks to ongoing investment in health, education and vocational training, as well as in the transport infrastructure (highways, subway systems, railways, bridges, dams) and in social (including dwellings, hospitals, schools, colleges and labour inspectorates) and industrial infrastructure.
.Proof of this is the fact that various communications have been sent to FEDECAMARAS, FEDEINDUSTRIA, the Unitary Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CUTV), the Venezuelan Confederation of Industry (CVI), Entrepreneurs for Venezuela (EMPREVEN), the Venezuelan Confederation of Industry (CVI), National Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CNTV), the National Union of Workers (UNT), and the Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions of Venezuela (CSAV), inviting them to a preparatory meeting with a view to establishing a forum for dialogue to promote inclusive, participatory and productive exchange, so they can hardly claim to be victims of a lack of consultation on the part of the Government.
.However, in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela one also finds the conditions that enable such social dialogue: solid and independent employers' and workers' organizations with access to information and social dialogue. There",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
200,"is the political will and commitment on the part of all social partners to engage in social dialogue in good faith.
.In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela there is a clear and constant respect for labour rights, particularly freedom of association and voluntary collective bargaining ' institutions which are increasingly growing in strength with institutional support. Lastly, there is respect and recognition among all of the social partners, who are now convinced, being the majority of the social players, of the need to broaden social dialogue in an inclusive manner. As evidence of the falseness of the accusations made,  saw the approval of the implementing regulations for the Organic Act on Prevention, Conditions and Working Environment (LOPCYMAT), which had been agreed through broad and inclusive social dialogue, including valuable comments from the Department of Standards of the International Labour Organization, so they can hardly say that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not promoted social dialogue. As such, this claim should be rejected and we ask that this be stated.
.Furthermore, with respect to the alleged incursions onto private land and other incidents, as described by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS, this claim has no foundation whatsoever and there is no evidence to prove or support it. Institutions and the population in general know perfectly well that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela operates a system of law and justice, so, as soon as any irregularity or violation of a law occurs, it should be reported to the appropriate authorities. A proper complaint should be submitted to the competent authority with supporting evidence, in this case the complainants' statements, to show that what is claimed to have happened in this instance took place. The least they could have done is include the relevant reports to the administrative and judicial authorities of the Venezuelan State in their written submission to the Committee on Freedom of Association. As such, the Government deplores the fact that the arguments of the FEDECAMARAS leadership have not been properly backed up, and therefore asks the honourable Committee to examine the facts of this matter and reject the complaint for the reasons given above.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters made by the IOE on  February , the Government reiterates that  in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela there has been and will be no condoning of acts of violence against institutions or property'  With respect to the Committee s recommendation published in the report for November , in which it requested the Government  to ensure the security of both the FEDECAMARAS head office and its leaders from now on and to inform the Committee on the outcomes of the investigation without further delay'  the Government, completely in keeping with its above statement, has taken upon itself the task of hunting down and identifying the physical and conceptual perpetrators of the deplorable incident that occurred at the headquarters of FEDECAMARAS on  February  and was reported to the Office of the Prosecutor General on  February  by the organization s administration. This is demonstrated by the various articles which have appeared in the various printed media published in our country.
.To that end, the People s Ministry for Labour and Social Security, in the person of the Director-General for Labour Relations, Dr Jos Gregorio Villarroel, established telephone communication with the first vice-president of FEDECAMARAS to express solidarity and deplore such a regrettable incident.
.With regard to ensuring the security of the FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Government reports that the above attack occurred despite the fact that the area is patrolled by the metropolitan police, officers of the national guard and officers of the Chacao police (under the administration of an opposition mayor), who monitor the headquarters  hours a day. Nonetheless, it is known that those who take offensive actions develop expertise in avoiding the attention of the security forces. We hope to be able to forward the results of investigations as soon as possible.
.Furthermore, concerning the alleged attacks on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters which had occurred previously (May and November ), according to the complaint presented to the ILO by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS, it must be said that institutions and the population in general know that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela operates a system of law and justice and therefore that, as soon as any irregularity or violation of a law occurs, it should be reported to the appropriate authorities with the relevant supporting evidence. The complainants stated that a new attack took place at the headquarters on  November  and has repeated the same modus operandi in presenting complaints to this international body while avoiding the natural legal route, as no complaints have been submitted to the competent authorities, such as the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.In the above cases, the least the complainants could have done is include the relevant reports to the administrative and judicial authorities of the Venezuelan State in their written submissions to the Committee on Freedom of Association, presented in May and October , respectively.
.As such, the Government deplores the fact that the arguments of the FEDECAMARAS leadership have not been properly backed up, and therefore asks the honourable Committee to examine the facts of this matter and reject the complaint for the reasons given above.
.Based on all the above reasons and considerations, we formally request that each of the complaints made here be rejected, as they lack any substance or proof.
.First of all, the Committee must express regret that, despite the Government s stated support for social dialogue and for certain measures, including regular meetings (more than  in recent months, according to the Government) on different issues, the Government has ignored the main recommendation it made at its November  meeting, requesting that it establish a national, high-level joint committee in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case in order to resolve problems through direct dialogue. These are the matters that concern and interest international employers' organizations and they seek measures that will enable them to properly develop the rights they have by virtue of Conventions Nos  and  and social dialogue. The Committee again expresses regret at the Government s unconstructive attitude in ignoring this fundamental recommendation, reiterates its previous recommendation and expects that the Government will not again postpone the adoption of the necessary measures. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard.Allegations of violence and intimidation againstemployers' organizations and their leaders
.The Committee draws attention to the seriousness of the allegations made by the IOE and must express its profound concern not only at the alleged incidents themselves (violent attacks by, according to the IOE, pro-government groups, mentioned by name, on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters, daubing graffiti, damaging property and making threats, in May  (the IOE has stated that FEDECAMARAS officials made legal statements several days after the attack), new attacks on FEDECAMARAS premises on  November and  December , and the detonation of an explosive device on the ground floor of the FEDECAMARAS building on  February , causing the death of an inspector (or until recently inspector) of the metropolitan police, who was planting the bomb, and seriously damaging the premises where, according to the press, pamphlets for a guerrilla group with members linked to the metropolitan police were found) but also at the attitude of the Government, whose statements on the May and November  attacks do not contain any information on the state of the investigations (which do not appear to have started), the exact nature of the incident or the identity of those behind it, but focus instead on observing that the IOE had made groundless assertions without evidence and that the  alleged' threats or attacks were not properly reported to the Office of the Prosecutor General, questioning whether this was part of the confrontational strategy adopted by FEDECAMARAS. The Committee therefore deplores all the more the fact that it must observe that the third attack on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters resulted in a bomb exploding on  February  and the death of the person planting it. The Committee notes the Government s statement that this incident was reported to the Office of the Prosecutor General by FEDECAMARAS the following day, and that the Director-General for Labour Relations of the People s Ministry for Labour and Social Security expressed his solidarity to the vice-president of FEDECAMARAS by telephone, deploring such a regrettable incident, which had however occurred in an area patrolled, according to the Government, by the forces of law and order, who monitor the headquarters  hours a day. The Committee notes that the Government hopes to be able to forward the results of investigations into this specific matter as soon as possible and that it attaches press cuttings stating that, according to reports from the authorities, the suspects have been identified.
.The Committee deplores",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
201,"that, months after the attacks and threats against the FEDECAMARAS headquarters and the considerable damage caused, the Government has communicated no results in terms of identifying the names of the culprits, it indirectly casts doubt on the May and November  attacks and it has not clarified the alleged involvement of individuals or groups close to the regime. The Committee reminds the Government that the present complaint has been sent to it officially and that, in so far as it deals with criminal acts, it should institute the appropriate criminal proceedings, if this has not already been done at national level.
.The Committee must emphasize that the events described, which in themselves are deeply intimidating, took place, according to the IOE s complaint, against a more general background of intimidation, including matters pending before the Committee on which proper replies have not been received from the Government, in particular with regard to alleged incursions onto private property (on which matter the Government has restricted itself to stating that the allegations are completely unfounded and that the parties concerned may report them to the administrative or judicial authorities) and other allegations of intimidation and violence. The Committee expresses concern in this regard and reiterates its previous recommendations, which follow:' as to the allegations of: violations of the private property of several employers' leaders in the agricultural and livestock sector; victims of invasions; the confiscation of land or expropriation without fair compensation, frequently in spite of rulings made by the judicial authorities regarding the restitution of lands to their owners, the Committee requests the Government to respond precisely to the specific allegations made by the IOE, including those relating to the measures taken against employers' leaders, Mr Mario Jos Oropeza and Mr Luis Bernardo Melndez, and the serious allegations regarding the abduction of three sugar producers in  and the death of six producers following an assault;' as to the alleged harassment of employers' leaders through hostile speeches given by the President of the Republic in which he makes damaging remarks and disparages employers' leaders, threatening to confiscate their property on supposed grounds of social interest, the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations in this regard without delay; and' given the seriousness of the above allegations that show a climate of intimidation surrounding leaders of employers' organizations and their members, the Committee stresses its concern and emphasizes that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights are fully respected and guaranteed, and that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected.
.Given that the present situation is incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. , the Committee once again requests the Government to effectively ensure the security of the FEDECAMARAS headquarters and its leaders and to take measures to step up investigations into the bomb attack of  February  at the FEDECAMARAS headquarters and ' if it has not been done ' to report the May and November  attacks on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters to the competent authorities, in order to establish the facts, prosecute those responsible and punish them severely to ensure that such crimes are not repeated. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard.Allegations of restrictions on freedom of expression
.With regard to certain alleged restrictions on fundamental rights (the withdrawal of Canal , RCTV s licence and government threats that have led two channels to change their editorial line), the Committee recalled in its previous examination of the case that the right of workers' and employers' organizations to express their opinions through the press or other social communication media is a fundamental element of freedom of association and that the authorities should abstain from unduly impeding its lawful exercise, and should fully guarantee freedom of expression in general and in particular that of employers' organizations. The Committee requested the Government to guarantee that this principle is respected, in particular with regard to the communications media used by FEDECAMARAS. The Committee also requested the Government to refrain from all interference in the editorial line of independent communication media, including the use of economic or legal sanctions, and to guarantee through the existence of independent means of expression, the free flow of ideas, essential to the life and well-being of employers' and workers' organizations.
.The Committee notes the IOE s allegations that freedom of information and expression is seriously threatened given that, since the closure of RCTV, the principal channel of expression for the private sector in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Government has begun to threaten the only independent audiovisual broadcaster remaining in the country, namely, Cadena Globovisin, and the Venezuelan President, Hugo Chvez, has threatened this station with closure on several recent occasions; the Vice-Minister for Foreign Relations, William Izarra, said on  January ,  Our socialism requires hegemony of communications and all communications should, as public property, be dependent on the State.' The Committee notes the IOE s allegation that Decree No.  of  May  created the TEVES, under the auspices of the People s Ministry, which is financed principally, according to section , by the initial  per cent contribution allocated to it by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, together with whatever it may receive annually under the budget act. This is the station which has replaced RCTV on its television and radio broadcasting frequencies and no private or independent station was able to take over these slots. RCTV s assets were seized and confiscated without any compensation.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements that it did not renew RCTV s licence to broadcast on radio frequencies, which the State is responsible for managing, because the enterprise had failed to rectify its violations of freedom of association, attacked the provisions of the Act for the Protection of the Child and Adolescent and had incited disregard for the law, despite requests from the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government places these allegations within the context of an orchestrated body of media opinion at national and international levels intended to spread the belief that citizens' rights to freedom of expression and information were being violated and that the country was moving towards an autocratic regime, and states that this argument was demolished when the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela recognized the opposition s victory in the last referendum. The Committee notes that the Government rejects the allegation that two channels were threatened to change their editorial line and states that no worker has submitted a complaint regarding the alleged change of editorial line of a communication medium.
.The Committee points out, however, that, according to the IOE s allegations, the President of the Republic has threatened Cadena Globovisin with closure on several recent occasions and that the complainant has highlighted the creation by decree of a public television channel financed entirely from the state budget, replacing RCTV s Canal .
.The Committee once again recalls that the right of workers' and employers' organizations to express their opinions through the press or other social communication media is a fundamental element of freedom of association and that the authorities should abstain from unduly impeding its lawful exercise, and should fully guarantee freedom of expression in general and that of employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that this principle is respected, in particular with regard to the communications media used by FEDECAMARAS. The Committee also requests the Government to guarantee through the existence of independent means of expression, the free flow of ideas, essential to the life and well-being of employers' and workers' organizations. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle expressed in paragraph  of its Digest of decisions and principles.Allegations concerning the freedom of movement of employers' leaders
.With regard to the allegations concerning restrictions on the freedom of movement of employers' leaders, recalling the importance that it attaches to the principle set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that everyone has the right to leave any country, including one s own, and to return to one s own country, particularly when participation in the activities of organizations of employers or workers abroad is involved, the Committee requested the Government in its previous examination of the case to ensure the freedom of movement of the leaders, Ms Albis Muoz and Mr Carlos Fernndez, and to take the necessary steps to annul the judicial proceedings and arrest order against Mr Carlos Fernndez so that he may return to the country without risk of reprisals. The Committee also requested the Government to send information on the eight employers' leaders mentioned by name by the IOE whose freedom of movement is restricted. Taking into account the persistent allegations concerning employers' leaders, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle expressed in",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
202,"paragraph  of its Digest of decisions and principles.
.The Committee notes the new allegations made by the IOE with respect to restrictions on the freedom of movement of employers' leaders. According to the IOE, in December ,  Venezuelan citizens, among them  employers' leaders, were prohibited from leaving the country as of that date. They included the former President of FEDECAMARAS, Ms Albis Muoz. This step is only taken when there is evidence to link a person to a crime, or if there is a risk of a person absconding or obstructing an inquiry. This arbitrary management of judicial procedures, instigated by the Government, has prevented those concerned from leaving the country on numerous occasions, leaving them, in particular Ms Albis Muoz, as her country s Employers' delegate to the last session of the International Labour Conference, unable to defend the interests of employers and their organizations.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that it is the criminal jurisdiction authorities that are able to prohibit departure from the country (not the Government) in the light of any proceedings underway. The Committee observes with interest that, according to the Government, Ms Albis Muoz ' former President of FEDECAMARAS ' can benefit from the amnesty Decree of  December . The Committee observes, however, that this is not the case for former FEDECAMARAS President Mr Carlos Fernndez as, according to the Government, he does not meet the conditions set out in the Decree, in particular because he is a fugitive from justice (the Government reiterates its previous statements ' already examined ' regarding this leader s participation in the events of  and the coup d at).
.The Committee requests the Government to send information regarding the prohibition from leaving the country imposed on  employers' leaders and to annul the arrest order against former FEDECAMARAS President, Mr Carlos Fernndez, so that he may return to the country without risk of reprisals.Social dialogue
.With regard to the allegations concerning lack of tripartite consultation and absence of tripartite will, the Committee observes that the IOE refers to the question of the minimum wage and states that, in addition to the fact that no tripartite consultation took place before the adoption of Decree No. , the lack of political will on the part of the Government to hold tripartite consultations should be highlighted (the last time the minimum wage was increased recently, notification was sent on the same day as it was published in the Official Bulletin); the IOE draws attention to the statements made by the Minister of Labour to the effect that no tripartite commission will be established for the purpose of fixing minimum salaries.  At this stage of the process, with the level of democratization that we have, we are not going to return to tripartism'  said Mr Rivero. The IOE states, however, that section  of the Organic Labour Act, in accordance with the provisions of the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), lays down that the basic salary shall be reviewed at least once a year by a tripartite commission, which has not been the case for the last eight years.
.The Committee notes that, according to the IOE, on  August , the draft organic act on labour stability was approved at its first reading by the National Assembly, without any tripartite consultation, despite being at odds with the provisions of the Termination of Employment Convention,  (No. ) and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), both of which have been ratified by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements that, in November , it announced the creation of a preparatory commission for the round table on participatory, inclusive and productive social dialogue due to take place on  January . The commission was suspended, however, as a result of the atmosphere of conflict generated by the hostile attitude of workers and employers who, after pursuing a fierce campaign against the proposal for constitutional reform, the text of which provided for rectification of some matters which had been the subject of complaints to the ILO, resolved on destabilization using a strategy of shortages of foodstuffs considered to be of prime necessity. According to the Government, the attitude of some worker and employer sectors within the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is not consistent with what they denounce as true in international forums; however, acting of its own accord and in the hope of a proactive and positive attitude, the Government states that it is prepared to bring them together once more, as the conditions for this are already in place.
.The Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, social dialogue has been growing ever wider and more diverse, especially during  and ; over this period, national, regional and local governments held innumerable meetings with FEDECAMARAS, as the Committee on Freedom of Association has been informed; the President and Vice-President of the Republic, ministers and high-level officials participated in these meetings, which dealt with a variety of issues; in addition, more than  meetings were held over the same period with all the social partners, regardless of other consultations carried out in writing or by survey; this social dialogue, which includes meetings of the regional and sectoral chambers with national, regional and local authorities, is linked to a sovereign and popular government policy, which together have constituted key factors for economic growth over the past  quarters, the reduction of inflation and unemployment, and improvements in economic and social infrastructure (housing, hospitals, etc.).
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that  saw the approval of the implementing regulations for the Organic Act on Prevention, Conditions and Working Environment (LOPCYMAT), which had been agreed through broad and inclusive social dialogue, including valuable comments from the Department of Standards of the ILO, so it can hardly be said that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not promoted social dialogue.
.The Committee concludes that, despite the fact that a considerable number of bipartite and tripartite meetings have been held, including in relation to certain draft acts, there are still significant deficiencies in social dialogue; the complainant has highlighted in its allegations the discussion or approval by Congress of acts that have not been the subject of consultations with employers' organizations, despite the fact that they affected the interests they defend, for example the draft organic labour stability act approved at its first reading, which contradicts ILO Conventions and renders the dismissal of workers with labour stability subordinate to administrative authorization. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principles expressed in paragraphs ,  and  of its Digest of decisions and principles.
.The Committee points out that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue and that the allegations seem to suggest that, when consultations are held, no attempt is made to take due account of the points of view of employers' organizations, much less to make efforts to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions. With regard to the allegations concerning deficiencies in social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by full and detailed consultations with the appropriate independent and most representative organizations of workers and employers. The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to any bipartite and tripartite consultations with FEDECAMARAS and any negotiations or agreements with this central organization or its regional structures and to transmit the corresponding texts. The Committee also requests the Government to ensure that any legislation adopted concerning labour, social and economic issues within the framework of the Enabling Act be subject to real, in-depth consultations with the independent and most representative employers' and workers' organizations, while attempting as far as possible to find shared solutions.Allegations of discrimination againstemployers' organizations
.The Committee recalls that it had referred to several allegations concerning the promotion of organizations close to the regime, draft acts, legislation or situations that could give rise to discrimination against FEDECAMARAS member organizations or their leaders, arbitrariness in fiscal policy negatively affecting enterprises whose heads have criticized the Government s policies, the draft act on international cooperation (state interference in donations and resources received by employers' organizations from public or private institutions) and the need for mechanisms ensuring that  labour solvency' certification for the purposes of",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
203,"obtaining public contracts is granted to enterprises with sufficient guarantees of impartiality. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principles expressed in paragraph  of its Digest of decisions and principles.
.The Committee observes that, according to the IOE s new allegations, the interventionism of the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the creation and functioning of parallel entrepreneurial organizations is still continuing, and highlights the following cases: () CONSEVEN ' since its creation, two prominent government figures have led this Confederation: Vice-President ' Mr Johnny Ynez Rangel, Governor for the state of Cojedes; economic advisor ' Mr Jos Gregorio Vielma Mora, Superintendent of SENIAT, the highest authority within the Ministry of Finance; and () FEDEINDUSTRIA ' the obtaining of foreign currency by enterprises, despite its abundance from petrol revenues, is subject to authorization and control by CADIVI; however, on its web site, FEDEINDUSTRIA informs its members that, thanks to links with parts of the administration, it is privileged to be able to obtain currency without having to submit to the bureaucratically slow and discriminatory processes imposed by CADIVI on any independent enterprise.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the organization known as the Confederation of Socialist Entrepreneurs, the Government confirms that it does not meddle in the freedom of association that the various organizations of employers enjoy, and it cannot therefore be said that there is any preferential treatment, favouritism or interference towards one confederation or another; the Government denies that CESV was formed under its auspices, and much less can it be said that it was intended to act as a substitute for any consultation with one entrepreneurial association or another; the Government states that, with this argument, the complainants could have tried to claim that this is an exclusive and discriminatory right which only they enjoy, which in itself is contrary to the legal system and the principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association. The Committee notes the Government s statement denying any interference in CONSEVEN, but observes that it has not responded in detail to the IOE s allegations concerning the presence in CONSEVEN of two prominent government figures, who even have responsibility for customs and taxation and the preferential treatment given to the employers' organization, FEDEINDUSTRIA, (privileges in obtaining foreign currency) by comparison with independent enterprises. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principles expressed in paragraph  of its Digest of decisions and principles. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these allegations and reiterates the importance of ensuring that the Government adopts a neutral attitude when dealing with any workers' or employers' organizations, and to examine all the above areas of potential discrimination against employers or organizations belonging to FEDECAMARAS and to keep it informed in this regard, including with respect to the passage of the draft act on international cooperation, the final version of which it hopes will contain provisions on rapid action in the event of discrimination.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements that, with regard to economic and monetary policy in the currency market, countless weekly meetings have been held between the CADIVI authorities and representatives of the various chambers of employers within the country; all these meetings have been characterized by the search for alternatives and for mechanisms to make the process of issuing preferential currency to obtain goods and services more fluid (minutes of meetings are attached).
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the purpose of and reason behind the Labour Solvency Act stem from the evasive conduct of some employers with respect to legal contributions ' particularly in terms of social security ' to the detriment of workers, which obliged the Government to fall back on this instrument to avoid such evasion, regulating in particular enterprises involved in contracts with the public sector by imposing on them the sole requirement that they be up to date and solvent with respect to the minimum requirements of Venezuelan legislation.
.With regard to the claim submitted by CONINDUSTRIA that the Labour Solvency Act is unconstitutional, the Government has no further details as the matter falls within the purview of the judicial authorities, but states that it will respect and comply with the decision taken in the matter; it also states that the periods of validity for labour solvency documents for all enterprises in the food sector were recently extended, but this falls outside the scope of the present complaint.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the Labour Solvency Act and its application, in its previous examination of the case, the Committee requested the IOE to provide further information on the enterprises which have closed owing to this Act, the number of workers who lost their jobs and any statistics at its disposal. The Committee requested the Government: () directly to examine, with FEDECAMARAS, mechanisms ensuring that  labour solvency' certification is granted in an impartial manner; and () to transmit the outcome of the claim made by CONINDUSTRIA that the Labour Solvency Act is unconstitutional.
.The Committee must reiterate the recommendations made at its November  meeting and, in particular, its request for information from the IOE and its request for action from the Government with regard to examining directly, with FEDECAMARAS, mechanisms ensuring that  labour solvency' certification is granted in an impartial manner. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the IOE s allegations concerning social production enterprises, with privileges bestowed upon them by the State, the Committee again invites the IOE to provide new information and clarification on these allegations, and requests the Government to ensure a neutral attitude in treatment of and relations with all employers' organizations and their members.Allegations relative to the creation of a new socialist state
.The Committee notes the IOE s allegations that, on  June , the Official Gazette published Decree No. , which had the status, value and force of an organic law establishing the Central Planning Commission, obliging employers' and workers' organizations to submit any information which may be required to the Central Planning Commission (section ), under threat of sanctions, including intervention by the police (section ); according to the IOE s statement, this Decree, as its text states, seeks to promote the transition to a centralized planning model to create  a model which can guarantee the spiritual and material needs of society, achieving supreme social felicity, this is the socialist model' (section .). By means of this Decree a  new socialist state' is created, in which all institutions, including entrepreneurial organizations and trade unions, are subordinated to strategic political directions and national, regional, sectoral and international plans which, once approved by the President of the Republic, will be compulsory to follow (sections  and ). The Committee requests the Government to respond to these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee again urges the Government to establish a national, high-level joint committee in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case in order to resolve problems through direct dialogue. The Committee expects that the Government will not again postpone the adoption of the necessary measures and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b)	With regard to the allegations of violence and intimidation against employers' organizations and their leaders, the Committee draws attention to the seriousness of the allegations made by the IOE and must express its profound concern. The Committee deplores that, months after the attacks and threats against the FEDECAMARAS headquarters and the considerable damage caused, the Government has not communicated any results in terms of identifying the names of the perpetrators of the attacks on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters, and that it indirectly casts doubt on the May and November  attacks and has not clarified the alleged involvement of individuals or groups close to the regime.(c)	Given that the present situation is incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. , the Committee once again requests the Government to effectively ensure the security of the FEDECAMARAS headquarters and its leaders and to take measures to step up investigations into the bomb attack of  February  at the FEDECAMARAS headquarters and ' if it has not been done ' to report the May and November  attacks on the FEDECAMARAS headquarters to the competent authorities in order to establish the facts, prosecute those responsible and punish them severely, to ensure that such crimes are not repeated. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d)	With regard to the allegations of: violations of the private property of several employers' leaders in the agricultural and livestock sector; victims of invasions; the confiscation of land or expropriation without fair compensation, frequently in spite of rulings made by the judicial authorities regarding the restitution of lands to their owners, the Committee once again requests the Government to respond precisely to",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
204,"the specific allegations made by the IOE, including those relating to the measures taken against employers' leaders, Mr Mario Jos Oropeza and Mr Luis Bernardo Melndez, and the serious allegations regarding the abduction of three sugar producers in  and the death of six producers following an assault.(e)	With regard to the alleged harassment of employers' leaders through hostile speeches given by the President of the Republic in which he makes damaging remarks and disparages employers' leaders, threatening to confiscate their property on supposed grounds of social interest, the Committee once again requests the Government to provide its observations in this regard without delay.(f)	Given the seriousness of the various allegations above, which show a climate of intimidation surrounding leaders of employers' organizations and their members, the Committee stresses its concern and emphasizes that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights are fully respected and guaranteed, and that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected.(g)	The Committee once more recalls that the right of workers' and employers' organizations to express their opinions through the press or other social communication media is a fundamental element of freedom of association and that the authorities should abstain from unduly impeding its lawful exercise, and should fully guarantee freedom of expression in general and that of employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that this principle is respected, in particular with regard to the communications media used by FEDECAMARAS. The Committee also requests the Government to guarantee, through the existence of independent means of expression, the free flow of ideas, essential to the life and well-being of employers' and workers' organizations and to ensure that the authorities do not threaten or intimidate media enterprises.(h)	The Committee requests the Government to send information regarding the prohibition from leaving the country imposed on  employers' leaders and to annul the arrest order against former FEDECAMARAS President, Mr Carlos Fernndez, so that he may return to the country without risk of reprisals.(i)	The Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations.

The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(l)	The Committee notes the Government s statement denying any interference in CONSEVEN, but observes that it has not responded in detail to the IOE s allegations concerning the presence in CONSEVEN of two prominent government figures, who even have responsibility for customs and taxation and the preferential treatment given to the employers' organization, FEDEINDUSTRIA, (privileges in obtaining foreign currency) by comparison with independent enterprises.

.The Government subsequently sent further observations in communications dated  February,  May and  September . The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) sent new allegations in communications dated  March,  May and  October .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Overall, taking into account the seriousness of the allegations that show a climate of intimidation surrounding leaders of employers' organizations and their members, the Committee stresses its concern and emphasizes that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights are fully respected and guaranteed, and that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected.(b) The Committee regrets the fact that the Government has ignored the recommendations made by the Committee at the last examination of the case, at which time it offered for the second time the technical assistance of the ILO to establish a system of labour relations based on the principles of the ILO Constitution and its fundamental Conventions, so that social dialogue could be consolidated and placed on a permanent footing. The Committee also requested that, as a first step, the National Tripartite Committee (as provided for in the Labour Code) be reconvened. The Committee reiterates these recommendations and suggests establishing a national, high-level joint committee in Venezuela with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations presented to the CFA in order to resolve problems through direct dialogue.(c) As to the allegations concerning deficiencies in social dialogue, the Committee has emphasized the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by full and detailed consultations with the appropriate independent and most representative organizations of workers and employers. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to any bipartite and tripartite consultations with FEDECAMARAS and any negotiations or agreements with this central organization or its regional structures and to transmit the corresponding texts. The Committee also requests the Government to ensure that any legislation adopted concerning labour, social and economic issues within the framework of the Enabling Act be subject to real, in-depth consultations with the independent and most representative employers' and workers' organizations, while attempting as far as possible to find shared solutions.(d) As to the allegations concerning the Labour Solvency Act and its application, the Committee requests the IOE to provide further information on the enterprises which have closed owing to this Act, the number of workers who lost their jobs and any statistics at its disposal. The Committee requests the Government directly to examine, with FEDECAMARAS, mechanisms ensuring that  labour solvency' certification is granted in an impartial manner. The Committee also requests the Government to transmit the outcome of the claim made by CONINDUSTRIA that the Labour Solvency Act is unconstitutional.(e) With regard to allegations concerning () economic, monetary and foreign exchange policies which",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
205,"the Government considers are not within the competence of the Committee, and on which the complainants allege their use for discrimination purposes; () the other allegations that the Government also considers as falling outside the competence of the Committee the arbitrary approach with regard to fiscal policy, negatively affecting enterprises whose heads have criticized the Government s policies; limitations placed on international cooperation funds; and allegations involving attempts to limit freedom of expression), the Committee requests the Government to respond in detail to the allegations concerning the questions referred to above.(f) However, with regard to the allegations concerning the draft legislation which would involve the introduction of limitations concerning international cooperation funds (state intervention concerning donations and cooperation resources and assistance received by employers' organizations from public or private institutions), the Committee recalls that any assistance or support that an international trade union organization might provide in setting up, defending or developing national trade union organizations is a legitimate trade union activity, even when the trade union tendency does not correspond to the tendency or tendencies within the country; furthermore, trade unions (or employers' organizations) should not be required to obtain prior authorization to receive international financial assistance in their trade union or entrepreneurial activities. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that these principles are respected when the draft legislation in question is being elaborated and that the State will not intervene in the matter of donations and resources received by employers' and workers' organizations at the national or international level. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(g) As to certain alleged restrictions to fundamental rights (the withdrawal of Canal , Radio Caracas Televisin s (RCTV) licence and Government threats that have led two channels to change their editorial line), the Committee recalls that the right of workers' and employers' organizations to express their opinions through the press or other social communication media is a fundamental element of freedom of association and that the authorities should abstain from unduly impeding its lawful exercise, and should fully guarantee freedom of expression in general and in particular that of employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee that this principle is respected, in particular with regard to the communications media used by FEDECAMARAS. The Committee also requests the Government to refrain from all interference in the editorial line of independent communication media, including the use of economic or legal sanctions, and to guarantee through the existence of independent means of expression, the free flow of ideas, essential to the life and well-being of employers' and workers' organizations.(h) As to the allegations of discrimination against FEDECAMARAS and its affiliated organizations, including the establishment or promotion of organizations or enterprises close to the regime such as, according to the allegations, the CESU or EMPREVEN, the Committee emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the Government adopts a neutral attitude when dealing with any workers' or employers' organizations, and requests the Government to respect the principles referred to in the conclusions.(i) As to the allegations of: violations of the private property of several employers' leaders in the agricultural and livestock sector; victims of invasions; the confiscation of land or expropriation without fair compensation, frequently in spite of rulings made by the judicial authorities regarding the restitution of lands to their owners, the Committee requests the Government to respond precisely to the specific allegations made by the IOE, including those relating to the measures taken against employers' leaders, Mr Mario Jos Oropeza and Mr Luis Bernardo Melndez, and the serious allegations regarding the abduction of three sugar producers in  and the death of six producers following an assault.(j) As to the allegations regarding limitations on employers' leaders' freedom of movement, recalling the importance that it attaches to the principle set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country, particularly when participation in the activities of organizations of employers or workers abroad is involved, the Committee requests the Government to ensure the freedom of movement of the leaders Ms Albis Muoz and Mr Carlos Fernndez and to take the necessary steps to annul the judicial proceedings and arrest order against Mr Carlos Fernndez so that he may return to the country without risk of reprisals. The Committee requests the Government to send information on the eight employers' leaders mentioned by name by the IOE whose freedom of movement is restricted, according to the allegations.(k) As to the alleged harassment of employers' leaders through hostile speeches given by the President of the Republic in which he makes damaging remarks and disparages employers' leaders, threatening to confiscate their property on supposed grounds of social interest, the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations in this regard without delay.(l) As to the allegations made by the IOE regarding social production enterprises with privileges bestowed upon them by the State, the Committee invites the IOE to provide new information and clarification on these allegations, and requests the Government to ensure a neutral attitude in treatment of, and relations with, all employers' organizations and their members.(m) As to the serious allegations made by the IOE dated  May  that a pro-governmental mob forced its way into the head office of FEDECAMARAS, daubing graffiti, damaging property and making threats, the Committee stresses the Government s obligation to ensure that employers' organizations can exercise their rights in an environment free of fear, intimidation and violence and urges the Government to undertake without further delay an investigation with a view to identifying the guilty parties and to instituting legal proceedings so that they can be duly prosecuted and punished and thereby prevent the repetition of these offences. The Committee requests the Government to ensure the security of both the FEDECAMARAS head office and its leaders from now on and to inform the Committee on the outcomes of the investigation without further delay.(n) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to transmit its observations in respect of the allegations of the IOE dated  October .
.The Government subsequently sent further observations in communications dated  October and  November , and  March . The IOE sent new allegations in a communication of  May .
.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Government invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee calls on the Government to continue keeping it informed of the bipartite and tripartite consultations that are held with FEDECAMARAS and of any negotiation or agreement with that federation or its regional bodies, and to send it the relevant texts. The Committee observes that the Government has not responded to its offer of ILO technical assistance in establishing a system of labour relations, based on the principles of the ILO Constitution and of its fundamental Conventions, so that social dialogue can be consolidated and placed on a permanent footing. The Committee calls on the Government to accept this offer and to keep it informed in this regard and, as a first step, to reconvene the National Tripartite Commission as provided for in the Labour Code.(b) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide further information on the development of social dialogue.(c) The Committee considers once again that the detention to which Carlos Fernndez, president of FEDECAMARAS, had been subjected, as well as being discriminatory, was intended to neutralize, or act as retaliation against, this employers' official for his activities in defence of employers' interests; therefore, it urges the Government to take all possible steps to annul immediately the judicial proceedings against Carlos Fernndez and his warrant for arrest and to ensure that he can return to Venezuela without delay and without risk of reprisals; the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the new allegations of the IOE dated  May .
.Subsequently, the Government sent new observations in its communications of  and  February .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee again urges the Government to comply with its legislation and without delay to convene periodically the tripartite commission.(b) The Committee reiterates the importance of draft bills which affect them directly being the subject of consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations and again points out to the Government the principles set forth in the conclusions concerning consultations.(c) The Committee underlines that over and beyond the consultations and meetings held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS, which the Committee can",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
206,"but encourage, it is important to consolidate these first steps in the new direction and structure them on a permanent footing. The Committee again offers the Government the services of the ILO to provide the State and society with its experience so that the authorities and social partners may regain trust and, in a climate of mutual respect, establish a system of labour relations based on the principles of the ILO Constitution and of its fundamental Conventions, as well as the full recognition, in all its consequences, of the most representative confederations and all organizations and important tendencies in the world of work. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all instances of social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and bipartite and tripartite consultations, and any negotiations or agreements that ensue and the Government s intentions with respect to the above offer of ILO technical assistance.(d) The Committee again urges the Government to reinstate FEDENAGA to the Agricultural and Livestock Council and to stop favouring CONFAGAN to the detriment of FEDENAGA.(e) The Committee once again considers that the arrest of Carlos Fernndez, president of FEDECAMARAS, as well as being discriminatory, aimed to neutralize or act as retaliation against this employers' official for his activities in defence of employers' interests and, therefore, it urges the Government to take all possible steps to annul immediately the judicial proceedings against Carlos Fernndez and to ensure that he may return to Venezuela without delay and without risk of reprisal; the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee deeply deplores the arrest of this employers' official and emphasizes that the arrest of employers' officials for reasons linked to actions relating to legitimate demands is a serious restriction of their rights and a violation of freedom of association, and requests the Government to respect this principle. The Committee deplores the fact that this employers' leader has already been in exile for several years and cannot return to the country for fear of reprisal by the authorities.(f) The Committee again urges the Government to carry out, without delay, an independent investigation with regard to: () the acts of vandalism at the premises of the Lasa Chamber of Commerce by Bolivarian groups supporting the Government ( December ); () the looting of the office of Julio Brazn, president of CONSECOMERCIO ( February ); () the threats of violence on  October  by alleged members of the government political party against Adip Anka, president of the Bejuma Chamber of Commerce; and () the allegations relating to  cases (up to April ) that have not been resolved by the authorities of illegal invasion of lands in the States of Anzotegui, Apure, Barinas, Bolvar, Carabobo, Cojidas, Falcn, Gurico, Lara, Mrida, Miranda, Monagas, Portuguesa, Sucre, Tchira, Trujillo, Yaracuy and Zulia, and urges that, in the case of expropriations, it fully respect the legislation laid down and the relevant procedures. The Committee suggests that the Government should make direct contact with the persons and institutions mentioned and with FEDECAMARAS with a view to carrying out an independent judicial investigation.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) on behalf of the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Manufacturers' Associations (FEDECAMARAS) dated  March , and further information in a communication dated  April . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  March .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that in this case the IOE and FEDECAMARAS have submitted allegations relating to:- the marginalization and exclusion of the employers' associations and FEDECAMARAS in the process of decision-making, thus excluding social dialogue, tripartism and in general the conducting of consultations (particularly in respect of very important legislation that directly affects the employers), in this way failing to comply with the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association;- actions and interference by the Government to promote the development of and encourage a new employers' organization in the agriculture and livestock sector to the detriment of FEDENGA, the most representative organization in this sector;- violations of human rights and rights fundamental for the exercise of activities of employers' organizations as contained in Convention No. , and in particular acts of aggression and intimidation by the authorities and paramilitary groups and reprisals against FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated organizations and its officials for exercising their right to strike in national civic work stoppages, namely:- the detention of Mr. Carlos Fernndez on  February  in reprisal for his actions as president of FEDECAMARAS, without judicial order and without the guarantees of due process; according to the complainants he suffered ill-treatment and insults from violent groups led by a government deputy;- physical, economic and moral harassment, even by means of threats and aggression against Venezuelan employers and their officials by the authorities or persons close to the Government (details are given of various cases);- operation of violent paramilitary groups with government support, with action against the premises of an employers' organization and against the protest activities of FEDECAMARAS;- creation of a hostile environment for employers by allowing the authorities (and at times encouraging) to dispossess and occupy farmland in full production in violation of the Constitution and of legislation and without adhering to legal procedures; the complainants refer to  cases of illegal invasions of estates in production and indicate that most of those cases have not been settled by the corresponding authorities;- the application of a system of exchange control decided unilaterally, discriminating against enterprises belonging to FEDECAMARAS in awarding administrative authorization for the purchase of foreign currency as a reprisal for participation by this employers' confederation in national civic work stoppages.
.In general terms, the Committee stresses the severity of the allegations and deplores that despite the fact that the complaints were submitted in March , the Government s reply dated  March  does not specifically respond to a considerable portion of the allegations.
.The Committee observes that in response to the complaint as a whole and to an incidental claim by the complainants (that the national civic work stoppage on ,  and  April  led to the national crisis that resulted in the resignation of the President of the Republic which was publicly confirmed by the country s highest military official, but that only lasted a few days as it was later cancelled by the President himself), the Government states that: () the only reason for the complainants' accusations is to justify their positions which have nothing to do with occupational or trade union situations but that on the contrary are strictly illegal, anti-democratic and discriminatory policies and FEDECAMARAS is an eminently political, subversive and anti-democratic institution; () FEDECAMARAS executives have demonstrated subversive actions with the clear intention of destabilizing the state institutions and imposing a dictatorship and taking power by force, as achieved on  and  April  with a coup d at, the de facto president then being Mr. Pedro Carmona, former president of FEDECAMARAS; () the work stoppage by FEDECAMARAS in April  became a general strike on  April , calling all the coupist factors to a march, giving a certain mass character to the ""protest"" to justify the coup d at that had been planned for months; () Carlos Fernndez, the following president of FEDECAMARAS, endorsed the dictatorship on  April  when he signed the ""Act of Constitution of the Government of Democratic Transition and National Unity"" in representation of the employers; () FEDECAMARAS, the CTV and other sectors in the civic work stoppages, between  and , made subversive calls in an attempt to achieve the overthrow of the President of the Republic and were resisted by the overwhelming majority of the people of Venezuela; these civic work stoppages occurred as a result of the far-reaching process of change in Venezuelan institutions and society vis--vis the previous implementation of neo-liberal measures, exclusive globalization, privatization and the deregulation of the rights of workers and the loss of control of the state economic apparatus by FEDECAMARAS; the loss of privileges by FEDECAMARAS and the fact that it is not above the Constitution is what this case is about.
.In this respect, the Committee will deal with questions relating to the civic work stoppages further on, but wishes to point out that this complaint does not relate to Pedro Carmona, that the allegations relate to situations both preceding and following the events of  and  April  (above all the national civic work stoppages of December  to January ), that its mandate is limited to examining the allegations of violations of the rights of workers' and employers' organizations, their representatives and affiliates, and that it is not the competent international forum to deal with questions of an exclusively political nature.
.The Committee regrets, however, that in its reply the Government indiscriminately and repeatedly discredits FEDECAMARAS and all",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
207,"its officials, without supporting this widespread condemnation with solid proof or judicial decisions.(a) Conclusions on the allegations of exclusion and marginalization of employers' associations and of FEDECAMARAS from social dialogue, particularly as regards the development of laws that affect their interests and the establishment of economic policies
.The IOE and FEDECAMARAS point out that the Government has not convened the Tripartite Commission of Venezuela for years and indicate that, in violation of legislation and the Constitution of the Republic, they have not been consulted in respect of the development of laws, legal texts or economic policies that directly affect their interests, specifically:- the Labour Procedure Act;- the awarding of a general increase in the minimum wage of  per cent by way of decree;- the ratification of the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention,  (No. );- the unilateral establishment of a new banking control scheme imposed by the authorities and more generally the establishment of blatantly anti-employer economic policies and guidelines; and- the Enabling Act of  November  that empowered the President of the Republic to issue  executive orders in areas affecting employers' interests.
.With respect to the  executive orders promulgated by the President of the Republic in accordance with the Enabling Act of the National Assembly dated  November , the Committee notes that according to the Government: () those executive orders were the result of broad consultation with the citizens, a number of the country s social and cultural sectors and consultations with both top-level and grass-roots organizations, which were involved in drafting them; () from the outset each of the employers' associations concerned affiliated to FEDECAMARAS and numerous actors in national life were consulted, including the employers' and workers' organizations (trade unions and federations); () on  August  the President of the Republic met with the executive committee of FEDECAMARAS in plenary and ""it was agreed to hold a working meeting between FEDECAMARAS and the Economic Office to deal with specific issues requiring action or consultations ... with the participation of the President of the Republic""; () on  August  the vice-president of FEDECAMARAS and representatives of the Chamber of Construction and of CONINDUSTRIA met with the Executive Office, headed by the Minister of Planning. and with the special commission that drafted the Hydrocarbon Act, to give their observations; in subsequent meetings they discussed the other areas of the Enabling Act by economic sector; in September  the president of FEDECAMARAS was invited to join the entourage of the President of the Republic on an official tour to make it known that the employers could engage in negotiations; () afterwards, when the officials of FEDECAMARAS realized that their unilateral plans were not accepted meekly by the authority and other sectors participating in the drafting of the executive orders, they began to distance themselves from opportunities for dialogue for selfish interests and voluntarily put an end to the dialogue of their own accord; () faced with this refusal, the Government maintained dialogue and negotiations with small and medium-sized enterprise sectors grouped together in FEDEINDUSTRIA, and reached cooperation and financing agreements; () there was consensus on most executive orders, with a few exceptions (it is not clear from the Government s reply whether when consensus is mentioned only FEDEINDUSTRIA is referred to or also some of the associations affiliated to FEDECAMARAS; nevertheless, given that the Government asks the question ""Why do the various employer sectors associated to FEDECAMARAS withdraw from dialogues to reach agreement on the promulgation of the enabling acts?"", it would appear that in the consensuses being referred to by the Government, those from the enterprise sectors associated to FEDECAMARAS were not included).
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the  executive orders covered subjects of vital importance for the attainment of human rights and directly benefited the vast impoverished Venezuelan population excluded for centuries from the so-called representative democracy. The Government also indicates that some FEDECAMARAS officials lodged annulment proceedings against the legislation approved and against regulations contained in various articles of the  executive orders and thus decided to cancel the validity of all of them.
.The Committee notes the Government s observations in support of its view about the self-exclusion of FEDECAMARAS from dialogue, as follows: () since attempts were made to paralyse the country on  December , the National Assembly, in view of the controversy created essentially by the leadership of FEDECAMARAS, set up a special commission and invited the various sectors, and the employer sectors attended the meetings; and () during the civic work stoppage convened by FEDECAMARAS on  December , this organization refused to engage in a dialogue with the Vice-President of the Republic on the grounds that it would only engage in a dialogue with the President of the Republic. The Committee also notes that the Government alleges that FEDECAMARAS refused to be part of the Presidential Commission and of the national tables for dialogue (May ) set up by the authorities, with the pretext that the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation had not joined them (according to the Government, the Confederation was not included because it lacks legitimate representatives). The Committee stresses, however, that, according to the Government, these commissions included journalists, intellectuals, the Catholic Church, etc., and that the tables for dialogue in question do not appear to relate to bipartite or tripartite negotiations or consultations in the sense imparted in ILO instruments (in effect, the Government indicates that it is ""management in the framework of direct and leading participation of citizens, establishing compromises and the rendering of accounts by the Government, employers, workers and organizations of the social and joint economy""), and neither do those conducted in the framework of the special commission of the ""Legislative Assembly"" referred to by the Government nor do the negotiations and consultations of the table for negotiations and agreements set up in November  in which, according to the Government, FEDECAMARAS participated and in which the Government and ""opposition"" reached a political agreement on  May  to always act within the framework of the national Constitution (the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States was invited to participate in this process).
.The Committee concludes that in the process of preparing the  executive orders in accordance with the Enabling Act of  November  - a process that by law had to be completed within one year - consultations were conducted with FEDECAMARAS and its affiliated organizations in the first phase and particularly in August . If these consultations were genuine consultations to achieve consensus, as maintained by the Government, or minimum superficial consultations for appearances, as maintained by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS (which point out, however, that the Government conducts detailed consultations with groups that are relatively unrepresentative of the population and that sympathize with the political regime), is something on which the Committee does not have sufficient elements to be able to make a decision. Whatever the case may be, the Committee observes that the Government s claim about the self-exclusion of FEDECAMARAS from dialogue in general and in particular with respect to the  executive orders as from September  does not seem to be backed up by conclusive evidence (for example, institutional statements by FEDECAMARAS, invitations from government authorities to deal with labour, social or economic issues in bipartite or tripartite forums that were not accepted). Returning to the  executive orders, apart from its surprise that it was decided to regulate a number of vital and complex issues (hydrocarbons, economic and social development, agrarian reform, etc.) in the short period of one year and by reason of executive orders promulgated by the Executive Power, the Committee must point out that in its reply the Government has not specifically replied to the allegations concerning major defects of legality and constitutionality with respect to those executive orders and the procedures followed to adopt them, defects that the complainant organizations outline in considerable detail and in a relatively convincing manner in their complaint and also in a long annex that is not included in this report. In effect, the Government s reply did not go into the substance of these matters and limited itself to indicating that some FEDECAMARAS officials lodged annulment proceedings against the legislation approved and against regulations contained in the  executive orders and that they thus decided to suspend the validity of those executive orders as a whole (the Committee believes that the judicial authority has not yet handed down its decision in this respect). Consequently, the Committee cannot determine whether the Government took into account the point of view of FEDECAMARAS on the defects of illegality and unconstitutionality that it invokes or whether it preferred to ignore this point of view during the preparation of the  executive orders.
.With respect to the new system of exchange control, the Committee notes that the Government bases that system on the fact that the country was on the brink of collapse at the beginning of  when there was a disproportionate flow of currency",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
208,"out of the country that would have prevented the Republic from being able to respond to the purchase of food, medicines and other materials abroad. The Committee notes the Government s indication that the new system of exchange control arose from an agreement signed between the Ministry of Finances and the Central Bank of Venezuela and that subsequently the President of the Republic in the Council of Ministers decreed, on  February , the establishment of the Currency Administration Commission. The Committee observes, however, that although the Government cited a situation of economic emergency to justify the new system of exchange control, there is nothing in its reply to indicate that it carried out consultations with FEDECAMARAS about this new system, which is, however, a matter that clearly affects their interests.
.The Committee also wishes to point out the following: () the Government s reply does not mention any bipartite or tripartite agreement or consultation in the sense imparted by ILO instruments with FEDECAMARAS as from September  in matters (policies or legislation) of a labour or economic nature; () the Government has not denied that the National Tripartite Commission has not met for years as stated in the allegations; and () the Government has also not denied the alleged lack of consultations with FEDECAMARAS in respect of the process of drafting important legislation such as the Labour Procedure Act, the widespread increase in the minimum wage of  per cent by way of order or in respect of the process of ratification of ILO Convention No. , the new banking control scheme or, on a more general note, the establishment of economic policies and guidelines.
.This being the case, the Committee concludes and deplores that for years the Government has not convened the National Tripartite Commission and that, on an ongoing basis, it does not conduct bipartite or tripartite consultation with FEDECAMARAS in the sense imparted by ILO instruments with regard to policies and legislation that fundamentally affect their interests in labour, social or economic matters, thus violating the fundamental rights of this employers' confederation. The Committee calls the Government s attention to the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), which establishes that consultations ""should aim, in particular, at joint consideration of matters of mutual concern with a view to arriving, to the fullest possible extent, at agreed solutions"" and includes among the matters for consultation ""the preparation and implementation of laws and regulations affecting their interests"". The Committee again points out to the Government the principle to which it already called its attention in its th Report, Case No.  (Venezuela), paragraph , reproduced below:The most representative employers' and workers' organizations, and in particular the confederations, should be consulted at length, on matters of mutual interest, including everything relating to the preparation and application of legislation concerning matters relating to them and to the fixing of minimum wages; this would contribute to legislation, programmes and measures that the public authorities have to adopt or apply being more solidly founded and to greater compliance and better implementation. This being the case, the Government should, as far as possible, also base itself on the consensus of workers' and employers' organizations, which should share the responsibility for achieving well-being and prosperity for the community in general. This is particularly true in light of the growing complexity of problems facing societies, and also, of course, facing the people of Venezuela. No public authority should claim to hold all knowledge nor presume that what it proposes will always and entirely satisfy the objectives in any given situation.
.The Committee emphasizes that tripartite consultation should take place before the Government submits a draft to the Legislative Assembly or establishes a labour, social or economic policy and that that consultation should form part of the elements required for the Government to take its decision, specifically because the confederations principally representative of workers and employers represent them, that is to say, they represent in this case thousands of employers and a very considerable proportion of the labour world. Therefore, in more general terms, the Committee recalls that the  Declaration of Philadelphia that forms part of the ILO Constitution reaffirms among the fundamental principles on which the ILO is based, the following: ""the war against want requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigour within each nation, and by continuous and concerted international effort in which the representatives of workers and employers, enjoying equal status with those of governments, join with them in free discussion and democratic decision with a view to the promotion of the common welfare"".
.For all the above reasons, the Committee urges the Government to stop marginalizing and excluding FEDECAMARAS from social dialogue and, in future, to fully apply the ILO Constitution and the principles therein on consultation and tripartism. The Committee also urges the Government, without delay, to convene periodically the Tripartite National Commission and to examine in this context, together with the social partners, all laws and orders adopted without tripartite consultation.
.From a more global perspective, the Committee wishes to refer both to the Government s statement in which it indicates that it does not recognize the legitimacy of the executive committee of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) (the Committee expressly asked the Government to recognize it - see th Report, Case No. , paragraph ) and to the general context in the country where an ever more apparent climate of political and social confrontation prevails, which the Committee deeply regrets. The Committee believes that the failure to recognize the executive committee of the CTV and the marginalization and exclusion of FEDCAMARAS from social dialogue, irrespective of the Government s reasons, constitutes one of the essential factors in the social and political confrontation and, in the Committee s view, this situation must be urgently remedied. It is obvious that these organizations (which are the most representative confederations) do not share the Government s economic and social model, but excluding them from the social institutional system does not contribute to social peace, public tranquillity and social stability in general and, on the contrary, it generates in practice ongoing conflicts and the mobilization of thousands of employers and hundreds of thousands of workers who cannot make their voices heard through the organizations they have chosen. The Committee therefore considers that the Government should give a new orientation to labour relations and reconsider its attitude with respect to FEDECAMARAS and the CTV.
.At this critical juncture in the situation in the country, and observing that for many years there has been an ongoing conflict between the Government, on the one hand, and FEDECAMARAS and the CTV, on the other, the Committee offers the Government the services of the ILO to provide the State and society with its experience so that the authorities and social partners may regain trust and, in a climate of mutual respect, establish a system of labour relations based on the principles of the ILO Constitution and of its fundamental Conventions, as well as the full recognition, in all its consequences, of the most representative confederations and all organizations and significant trends in the labour world.(b) Conclusions on the allegations concerning actions and interference by the Government to promote and encourage a new employers' organization in the agriculture and livestock sector to the detriment of FEDENGA, the most representative organization in the sector
.The complainant organizations have alleged that the Government has promoted the development of the so-called National Confederation of Farmers and Stockbreeders of Venezuela (CONFAGAN) to the detriment of the National Federation of Stockbreeders (FEDENGA), the true representative organization in the sector, carrying out actions to benefit CONFAGAN, the Government interfering, in this way, in the internal affairs of the employers' organizations. The complainant organizations indicate that FEDENGA was excluded from the Agriculture and Livestock Council owing to the support it provided to the popular claim of FEDECAMARAS against the Government. The Committee deplores that the Government has not replied to these allegations (it has only indicated that FEDENGA threatened to paralyse the production of meat and milk in  and to extend a work stoppage in the State of Zulia to other regions) and consequently it urges the Government to reinstate FEDENGA to the Agriculture and Livestock Council and to stop favouring CONFAGAN to the detriment of FEDENGA.(c) Conclusions on the national civic work stoppage of December  to January  and the arrest with ill treatment of president Carlos Fernndez on  February  in reprisal for his actions as president of FEDECAMARAS and without the guarantees of due process
.Concerning the ill treatment suffered by Carlos Fernndez, president of FEDECAMARAS, during his arrest, the Committee notes the Government s statements that his detention was replaced by the judicial authority with house arrest when the lawyers of Carlos Fernndez alleged his blood pressure problems. The Committee notes the press articles to which the Government refers and according to which Carlos Fernndez and his wife stated that they had been well treated by the police who carried out the arrest and",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
209,"that he had not been physically ill treated and that there had been no aggression against him. The Committee stresses that press articles are of limited value as evidence and that the complainant organization has alleged that: () Carlos Fernndez was assaulted by unidentified individuals on  February ; they were not wearing uniforms and did not have the appearance of officials or police and had arrived in vehicles without identification, without number plates and without a judicial warrant; () Carlos Fernndez thought that it was a kidnapping and tried to defend himself; following a violent struggle in which Mr. Fernndez was hit causing superficial injuries and bruises to the chest area, he was immobilized and pushed into his car; () shots were fired and only afterwards people appeared and identified themselves as police; () on  February , he was shut in a cell measuring  metres by  metres, without ventilation, without light and with only a mat on the floor.
.Given that the Government has not specifically replied to these points, the Committee requests it to carry out an investigation in this respect and to keep it informed.
.Concerning the allegations relating to the violation of due process, the Committee notes that, according to the allegations: () Carlos Fernndez was detained on  February  without being presented with a judicial warrant; () on  February , he remained incommunicado and was not able to speak to his lawyers; () press articles attributed to the President of the Republic expressions from which it could be gathered that he was involved in this detention; () on  and  February, he made a statement before the judicial authority; () violent groups led by a government deputy tried to exert pressure on the judicial authority on  and  February by congregating and hindering access to the court and shouting insults; () on  February  (it appears from the allegations), the imprisonment was changed to house arrest by judicial decision taking into account Carlos Fernndez s state of health; () the judge who handed down the initial order of detention was challenged by the defence and withdrew; () of the five accusations initially made against Carlos Fernndez three were eliminated (treason against one s country, conspiracy (criminal association) and devastation (incitement to plunder the nation), with the charges of civil rebellion and instigation to commit offences remaining.
.The Committee wishes to refer to an appendix sent by the complainants (which is not contained in the allegations to avoid repetitions) which is reproduced below and which describes a certain number of irregularities and violations of due process to most of which the Government has not responded:The process adhered to by the authorities of Venezuela in the detention of Carlos Fernndez Prez is evidence of the intention to leave him in a state of defencelessness before the charges imputed to him.Carlos Fernndez was summoned to the Office of the Attorney-General on  January of the current year to make a statement as a witness.After having begun the corresponding statement he was informed that his status has changed and he was sent a summons to make a further statement on  February, together with his defence lawyers, but this time as defendant.The day fixed for the statement, the defence lawyers he appointed asked to postpone the statement on the grounds that they had not had access to the file. On that occasion, the Sixth Prosecuting Attorney of the Office of the Attorney-General refused to show the file to the lawyers and the grounds were entirely irregular.In view of the conduct of the Office of the Attorney-General, Carlos Fernndez went to the same judge who had witnessed the swearing in of his defence lawyers and exercised the right derived from the right of defence, consisting in that the statement that the procurators should have taken from him would not be given at the Office of the Attorney-General but instead in the court of jurisdiction (article (), organic Criminal Procedure Code).
.On  February, the Office of the Attorney-General gave access to the file. Irregularly, due to the conduct of the defence lawyers, the Sixth Prosecuting Attorney, Luisa Ortega, presented summons for Carlos Fernndez, in order for him to make his statement at the Office of the Attorney-General. The summons were incoherent, because on one it was stated that he should appear on Monday,  February, and on the other on Tuesday,  February.On Monday,  February, Carlos Fernndez presented himself at the Office of the Attorney-General, accompanied by his defence lawyers, and stated that he would not be appearing because he had exercised the right for the prosecuting attorneys to take his statement before the court of jurisdiction.On Wednesday,  February, the first court of jurisdiction refused him the right to make a statement before the court. On Monday,  February, the defence appealed and the decision remained pending as to whether he would be obliged to make his statement at the Office of the Attorney-General.On the following day,  February, with the decision remaining pending that would imply the obligation to make the statement before the Office of the Attorney-General, and without anything having been said about the appeal, the Office of the Attorney-General went to a court other than the one that had been involved and requested that Carlos Fernndez be detained.This request, without him being allowed to exercise his defence through a statement, lacks sense. It should only be able to be applied to those who have refused to appear. This is not the case with Carlos Fernndez who, faced with the proceedings initiated against him, was entirely ready to cooperate with the judicial authorities.He appeared twice before the Office of the Attorney-General, on the first occasion when he made a statement as a witness, he committed legislative fraud because at that time, in accordance with the provisions of the organic Criminal Procedure Code, the content of the investigation made him a defendant, depriving him of the right of defence, given that he had not been given access to the proceedings and his lawyers were not allowed to be present. Despite this, Carlos Fernndez did attend at the Office of the Attorney-General.The second time he went to the Office of the Attorney-General was not to carry out an act of defiance, but to let the acting prosecuting attorneys know that he would not attend to make the statement because he was exercising the right to have his statement taken in court.The reaction of Luisa Ortega, Sixth Prosecuting Attorney at the Office of the Attorney-General, to the exercise of the right indicated and to a decision that was not final, was to treat him in the way that people are treated who are reluctant to make statements and, without having heard him or allowed him to make a statement or defend himself, promoting proceedings that could benefit him and seeking, in this way, to destroy the basis of the accusation previously made against him, directly requested that he be detained.Carlos Fernndez was not reluctant or rebellious before the Office of the Attorney-General. He demonstrated with his actions his readiness to comply with the criminal accusation against him, becoming the one being persecuted, without due process.The Procurator s actions violated the following rights:- Effective judicial protection: the first court of jurisdiction refused to recognize the right whereby the statement could be taken by the Office of the Attorney-General in the presence of the judge so that he could monitor the activities of the Office of the Attorney-General.- His right to defence was violated as he was not informed of the accusation against him prior to requesting that he be detained. The haste of the Prosecuting Attorney meant that she did not wait for the decision on the appeal on the right lodged by Carlos Fernndez.- He was not allowed to exercise the means of defence established in article  of the organic Criminal Procedure Code which materialized when he made the statement.- In addition, before his detention he was illegally prevented from filing proceedings to demonstrate the absence of any offence.- The containing order of the request for detention submitted by the Prosecuting Attorney also violated his right to defence because the incriminating elements were not presented individually and, although he was accused of five offences, it is not said what proof relates to each of them, presenting them as a whole, which means that the defence has to guess which is the evidence that is supposed to demonstrate each one of the five offences he is accused of.- The request is lodged with a court that was not competent to hear it as it was not that court which had carried out the preliminary hearing. It was a court other than the one that carried out the first procedural acts, such as the appointment of defence lawyers and that decided on the requests for his statement to be taken before the court and that the inadmissibility of the means of preventive judicial imprisonment was",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
210,"declared in advance (article () and () of the organic Criminal Procedure Code).- Despite the fact that the court to which the request was made knew after the detention that it was not competent and that the jurisdictional court was, it did not decline to hear the case, it did not return the records to the first jurisdictional court, which is why it was necessary to challenge it.- Of the five offences of which he was accused, following the decision of the court to which the file was referred as a result of the challenge already mentioned, two survived: rebellion and instigation to commit an offence. The conduct attributed to Carlos Fernndez is not consistent with these offences. As such, the principle of legality is violated, as established in article () of the national Constitution. For example, for rebellion there has to be insurrection, an armed uprising, and the work stoppage convened by FEDECAMARAS was peaceful, supported by civil society, not armed and in the exercise of a democratic right.- The court that handed down the final decision violated the principle relating to the general jurisdictional court before or at the time of the indictment, because the one competent to hear the case, as has already been said, because it had carried out the preliminary hearing, was the court of jurisdiction.- Despite there being a court that had carried out the preliminary hearing, the Office of the Attorney-General did not lodge its request for imprisonment with this court, but went to another that, incidentally, knew nothing about any of the abovementioned rights. The Representative of the Office of the Attorney-General mentions nothing in this respect; in other words this information was hidden at the time the detention of Carlos Fernndez was being requested.- Therefore, inter alia, the following have been violated: the right to defence, the right to the general jurisdictional court, the obligation of the Office of the Attorney-General to be a party in good faith in the criminal process (article  of the Constitution of Venezuela, Nos. , ,  and ).The Committee notes the Government s statements according to which: () the arrest of Carlos Fernndez took place following a legally valid request and was executed by the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic, in the person of the Sixth Prosecuting Attorney of the Office of the Attorney-General; () the proceedings were originally initiated for the offences of instigation to commit an offence, devastation, incitement to conspire and treason against one s country, at the request of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic in accordance with the organic Criminal Procedure Code, accusations brought against him from the accumulated evidence that shows the damage to the country by the sabotage of the oil industry during the public and notorious leadership by Carlos Fernndez of the so-called ""civic work stoppage"" or lockout that took place in December  and January ; () the trial judge was No.  of the criminal jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas who in turn was challenged by the defence lawyers of Carlos Fernndez and replaced with trial judge No. ; () this judge did not accept the crimes of treason against one s country, incitement to conspire (conspiracy) and devastation and upheld the accusations of civil rebellion and instigation to commit offences and detained Carlos Fernndez under house arrest while she continued the trial on the basis of blood pressure problems; () on  January , Mr. Fernndez testified as a witness at the Office of the Attorney-General and was then summoned to make another statement as a defendant, a summons that he did not attend to which he did not agree; () on  February , the representatives of the Attorney-General asked for preventive judicial imprisonment before the court of jurisdiction, proposing that Mr. Fernndez be brought before the jurisdictional committee and the judge to rule as appropriate; () on  February , trial court No.  granted the request and issued a warrant to arrest and detain Mr. Fernndez; () on  March , the Appeals Court decided to free Mr. Fernndez, withdrawing the charges against him; Mr. Fernndez immediately left the country; () on  March , the Sixth Prosecuting Attorney of the Office of the Attorney-General lodged an appeal for protection of constitutional rights (amparo) with the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court of Justice, which accepted the allegations of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic and once again ordered the house arrest of Carlos Fernndez, an order that the Supreme Court of Justice ruled to maintain in a decision read by the President of the Court on  August ; Mr. Fernndez is therefore on the run.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements according to which: () the arrest of Carlos Fernndez took place following a legally valid request and was executed by the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic, in the person of the Sixth Prosecuting Attorney of the Office of the Attorney-General; () the proceedings were originally initiated for the offences of instigation to commit an offence, devastation, incitement to conspire and treason against one s country, at the request of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic in accordance with the organic Criminal Procedure Code, accusations brought against him from the accumulated evidence that shows the damage to the country by the sabotage of the oil industry during the public and notorious leadership by Carlos Fernndez of the so-called ""civic work stoppage"" or lockout that took place in December  and January ; () the trial judge was No.  of the criminal jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas who in turn was challenged by the defence lawyers of Carlos Fernndez and replaced with trial judge No. ; () this judge did not accept the crimes of treason against one s country, incitement to conspire (conspiracy) and devastation and upheld the accusations of civil rebellion and instigation to commit offences and detained Carlos Fernndez under house arrest while she continued the trial on the basis of blood pressure problems; () on  January , Mr. Fernndez testified as a witness at the Office of the Attorney-General and was then summoned to make another statement as a defendant, a summons that he did not attend to which he did not agree; () on  February , the representatives of the Attorney-General asked for preventive judicial imprisonment before the court of jurisdiction, proposing that Mr. Fernndez be brought before the jurisdictional committee and the judge to rule as appropriate; () on  February , trial court No.  granted the request and issued a warrant to arrest and detain Mr. Fernndez; () on  March , the Appeals Court decided to free Mr. Fernndez, withdrawing the charges against him; Mr. Fernndez immediately left the country; () on  March , the Sixth Prosecuting Attorney of the Office of the Attorney-General lodged an appeal for protection of constitutional rights (amparo) with the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court of Justice, which accepted the allegations of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic and once again ordered the house arrest of Carlos Fernndez, an order that the Supreme Court of Justice ruled to maintain in a decision read by the President of the Court on  August ; Mr. Fernndez is therefore on the run.
.The Committee notes that the Government has sent the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice (/VIII/) that revokes the decision of the Appeals Court on procedural grounds (missing the signature of one of the three magistrates (/III/) who, for reasons of health, was absent from the court for some hours) but regrets that the Government has not sent the decision of the Appeals Court that ruled on the question of law. The Committee also notes that the Government s statements did not answer each one of the violations of due process and irregularities that, according to the complainant organization s annex listed previously, Mr. Fernndez had been a victim and it believes that the complainant organization has provided sufficiently convincing evidence of a lack of impartiality in this case. Very specifically, the Committee expresses its surprise that a judge was challenged; three of the charges were suppressed by another judge and the Appeals Court ended up dropping all of them, although the decision of this court was brought before the Supreme Court of Justice, which revoked it for procedural reasons and once again decided at the request of the Office of the Attorney-General (the same prosecuting attorney that had originally accused him of five charges) to order the arrest of Mr. Fernndez.
.With regard to the question of law, the Committee notes that the point of view of the complainant organizations and of the Government differ, although both match in the arrest of Carlos Fernndez, President of FEDECAMARAS, in relation to the national civic work stoppage that took place between  December  and the end of January .
.The Committee notes the complainant organizations' statements",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
211,"that the arrest of Mr. Fernndez was in retaliation and as discrimination against the exercise by FEDECAMARAS of its right to peaceful demonstration and for its protest activities against the abuses of the Government and the economic and social crisis brought about by the Government s policies, the lack of dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and the violation of the rights of employers and workers, which culminated in insecurity, violations of private property with invasions of agricultural land and property, encouraged by the Head of State, an increase in poverty and unemployment, public verbal attacks by the Head of State on employers and their leaders, etc.; in this context a number of national civic work stoppages were carried out; the arrest of Carlos Fernndez took place following the national work stoppage begun on  December  and concluding at the end of January ; this stoppage was carried out by the Democratic Organizing Committee that united FEDECAMARAS, the most representative trade union organizations, the main NGOs and the political parties.
.However, the Committee notes that the Government maintains that: () the objective of the ""civic work stoppage"" of FEDECAMARAS and the Democratic Organizing Committee (of which it is a part) relates not to trade union purposes but to strictly political, insurrectional, subversive and anti-democratic purposes; the objective of the civic work stoppage which was begun in December  was, on the contrary, the overthrow of the President of the Republic; the objectives were announced in various ways: ""to get a recall referendum"", ""to see the fall of the President"" or ""for the President to initiate an election process""; () on the FEDECAMARAS web site it stated that the civic work stoppage was ""our greatest pressure to demand a democratic and electoral outcome to the crisis in the country"" and the Democratic Organizing Committee urged the population to continue until the electoral goal was achieved (a recall referendum for the President of the Republic); () during the civic work stoppage dissident soldiers in the Plaza Francia in Altamira were implicated in the murders of three young people and in terrorist acts at the Consulate of Colombia and the Embassy of Spain and in other areas; () before the civic work stoppage, Carlos Fernndez approached the soldiers taking part in the coup of April  in order to ""unify criteria"" and shortly afterwards he allied himself with those rebel soldiers (who called for civil disobedience with insurrectional objectives) to sign a ""democratic agreement"" against the Government; the expression ""indefinite national work stoppage"" was already present in all statements; () Mr. Fernndez gave public instructions to illegally and fraudulently collect signatures to call for a consultative referendum that they tried to convert to a recall referendum; he publicly encouraged sabotage of the economy, violence and social intolerance; he publicly called for the employers to close their companies (including those producing food and medicines) that were paying wages to workers who did not complete their working hours; he subjected the population to violent closures of motorways and streets; he encouraged fascist sectors to undertake violent closures of businesses, supermarkets, etc., accompanied by municipal police belonging to the opposition during the work stoppage; as a result of the tirades of Mr. Fernndez, there were attacks on workers and public transport vehicles and in some cases people were seriously injured; () the right to education, freedom of movement and the health of individuals was violated; employers in the country tipped millions of litres of milk into the rivers and other waterways, forcing the population to face a lack of necessary foodstuffs; () the right to information, freedom of expression, television and mass media were subject to abuse (and the main protagonists were Mr. Ortega and Mr. Fernndez) with subliminal advertising techniques and war propaganda, lies, manipulation and disinformation, incitement to constrain freedom of movement; officials and their families were threatened physically and verbally; the installations of the Oil Refineries of Venezuela company were cut off and sabotaged using terrorist activity causing damage to equipment and the finances of the country (more than , million dollars) as this company provides  per cent of the GDP of the Republic; more than , labour posts were lost and unemployment increased five percentage points (from . to . per cent); the oil industry suffered sabotage to refineries and oil wells and other installations that led to the spillage of crude oil; boats were stopped or sunk; access valves and keys to computer centres in the oil industry were sabotaged; () the provision of energy sources to the aluminium and iron industries in Guyana was sabotaged; () there was harassment of foreign embassies; campaigns were initiated to encourage non-payment of taxes and social security payments; () a restricted work timetable was implemented in financial organizations; a publicity and propaganda campaign against the celebration of Christmas, etc., was carried out.
.The Committee is aware that the civic national work stoppages were huge and complex public demonstrations in which not only members of employers' and workers' organizations participated but also members of sympathetic political parties, NGOs and where the right to demonstrate was combined with employers' lockouts and probably indefinite general strikes which lasted, in the case of the national civic work stoppage, from December  to January  - two months.
.The Committee notes that the Government has basically described the illegality and illegitimacy of these civic work stoppages from an exclusively political or insurrectional point of view (the aim to overthrow the President of the Republic) and has maintained the legality and the legitimacy of the arrest of Carlos Ortega. In order to deal with those issues, the Committee wishes to highlight a series of issues.
.The first issue is that the Constitution of the Republic very generously provides for the right to public assembly without prior permission (article ) and the right to strike in the public and the private sectors (article ) and other human rights, and it includes provisions on the recall of all mandates and magistracies through the calling of a referendum (article ). Also, article  provides that ""the people of Venezuela, true to their republican tradition and their struggle for independence, peace and freedom, shall disown any regime, legislation or authority that violates democratic values, principles and guarantees or encroaches upon human rights"" (in this respect, a report of the general secretary of the OAS attached by the Government indicates that this provision must not be interpreted as a general right to rebellion). Because this is a recent Constitution, these rights have not been developed in legislation and this (for example, in cases of conflicts of constitutional rights; or of minimum services to be maintained during strikes) leads to confusion and, although it does not justify them, it may explain some of the abuses and excesses referred to by the Government, that the Committee deeply regrets. The second issue is whether the national civic work stoppage was exclusively political and insurrectional as indicated by the Government (in which case, the Committee would not have competence in this issue). In this respect, the Committee emphasizes that the national civic work stoppage did not give rise to any coup d at and that while the Government has provided information that shows that the main objective was to depose the President of the Republic or achieve a recall referendum, the abovementioned constitutional provisions do not allow for illegality or illegitimacy or the classification of insurrectional nature to be attributed to this objective (or demand) on the hypothesis that it was the only one (moreover, the Government has annexed a political agreement with the support of the OAS) following the national civic work stoppage that the Government signed with the Democratic Organizing Committee - which organized the work stoppage - in which the parties issued a statement against violence and for peace and democracy and propose specifically to contribute to resolving the crisis in the country through the electoral process and refer to the concept of recall referenda (article  of the Constitution) if they are formally requested by a minimum number of voters. The Committee emphasizes, however, that the allegations in the present complaint show that FEDECAMARAS and the employers considered the national civic work stoppage directly linked to the social and political acts of the Government and their consequences and to the exclusion of FEDECAMARAS from social dialogue by the Government; moreover, the Government itself has recognized in its reply that it does not accept the legitimacy of the executive committee of the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV), which also took part in the national civic work stoppage and which is the most representative workers' confederation (the chronology itself of the statements during the national civic work stoppage, which the Government attached, includes, in the Committee s opinion, statements vindicating Mr. Fernndez that show that the national civic work stoppage was an act of protest by FEDECAMARAS for employer reasons and in fact this official mentions ""mistaken economic policies, devaluation, controlled exchange rates ... the objective of the Government is to destroy",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
212,"private enterprise"" ... ""we do not agree that they continue with the closure of enterprises ..., , million dollars"" are missing ""through government mismanagement ...""). Consequently, the Committee cannot share the point of view of the Government that this national civic work stoppage had nothing to do with issues relevant to employers' organizations. Moreover, the Committee recalls the principle that ""in a situation in which workers' organizations [and employers' organizations] consider that they do not enjoy the freedoms essential for the performance of their functions, they should be entitled to demand the recognition of these freedoms and such claims should be considered to form part of legitimate trade union activities"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.The third issue refers to the arrest of Carlos Fernndez, president of FEDECAMARAS, with regard to which the complainant organizations indicate discrimination and the fact that it occurred as a result of his activities as an employers' official. The Committee notes that the participation in the civic work stoppage was out of the ordinary (according to statements by the current president of FEDECAMARAS, which appear in one of the Government s annexes, for some days participation rose to one and a half million people) and notes that the Government states that there was sabotage and violent acts with damage to physical integrity, as well as numerous violations of human rights and enormous economic and job losses. The Committee profoundly regrets this and hopes that those responsible for the crimes will be punished. The Committee notes that the Government ascribes to the president of the CTV and the president of FEDECAMARAS incitement to a large part of the crimes and offences mentioned but it has not proven nor highlighted the specific causal link between the various specific statements (""tirades"" according to the Government) or possible acts of the president of FEDECAMARAS and such offences, such that it seems to credit him rather with a non-individualized or causal generic global incitement; moreover, in the chronology of statements during the civic work stoppage sent by the Government as an attachment there is no statement by Carlos Fernndez showing calls to violence or the commission of crimes. The Committee recalls that ""there should be no confusion between trade unions' [or employers' organizations  performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers [or employers], and the possible pursuit by certain of their members of other activities that are unconnected with trade union functions [or those of employers' organizations]. The penal responsibility which such persons may incur as a result of such acts should in no way lead to measures being taken to deprive the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action"" [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Moreover, the Committee notes that the Government s reply seems to show that of the organizations involved in the national civic work stoppage and that made up the Democratic Organizing Committee (FEDECAMARAS, CTV, NGOs, important political parties, etc.), arrest warrants were issued only for the president of FEDECAMARAS and the president of CTV.
.Taking all these facts and the specific constitutional context of Venezuela into account, the Committee considers that the arrest of Carlos Fernndez, as well as being discriminatory, aimed to neutralize or act as retaliation against this employers' official for his activities in defence of employers' interests and, therefore, it urges the Government to take all possible steps to annul immediately the judicial proceedings against Carlos Fernndez and to ensure that he may return to Venezuela without delay and without risk of reprisal. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee deeply deplores the arrest of this employers' official and emphasizes that the arrest of employers' officials for reasons linked to actions relating to legitimate demands is a serious restriction of their rights and a violation of freedom of association, and requests the Government to respect this principle.(d) Conclusions on the allegations relating to discrimination in the application of a new system of exchange control
.With regard to the allegations relating to the application of a new system of exchange control in  (suspension of free buying and selling of currencies) unilaterally established by the authorities, discriminating against companies belonging to FEDECAMARAS in the administrative authorization for the purchase of foreign exchange currencies (in retaliation for its participation in the national civic work stoppages), the Committee notes that the Government replies by asking how, following the civic work stoppage (from December  to January ), in the last three trimesters of , would they have been able to recover the more than , posts that were lost after the economic sabotage of the national economy if they had refused companies foreign currencies. The Committee, however, points out that the allegations are based on quoted declarations of the Minister of Production and Trade and the President of the Republic. The Committee has examined elsewhere the justification given by the Government for this system.
.Having taken account of the alleged discrimination and serious difficulties expressed by the complainant organizations because of the negative impact in many industries of this system that was unilaterally established by the authorities, the Committee requests the Government to examine with FEDECAMARAS, without delay, the possibility of modifying the current system and that it guarantee, meanwhile, in case of complaints, the application of the same system, without discrimination of any sort, through impartial bodies. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(e) Conclusions on the allegations relating to the physical, economic and moral harassment (including threats and attacks against the Venezuelan employer sector and its officials by the authorities or people close to the Government); the operations of violent paramilitary groups with governmental support against the facilities of an employers' organization and against the protest actions of FEDECAMARAS; the dispossessions and occupation of farms in full production that have been allowed or at times encouraged by the authorities in violation of the Constitution and without following legal procedures; the policy of harassment of the private communication sector
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not specifically replied to these allegations. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures, without delay:- to ensure that the authorities do not try to intimidate, pressure or threaten employers and their organizations for their activities with regard to legitimate demands, in particular in the communications and in the agro-industrial sectors;- to carry out, without delay, an investigation with regard to: () the acts of vandalism at the premises of the Lasa Chamber of Commerce by Bolivarian groups supporting the regime ( December ); () the looting of the office of Julio Brazn, president of CONSECOMERCIO ( February ); () the threats of violence on  October  by alleged members of the government political party against Adip Anka, president of the Bejuma Chamber of Commerce;- to carry out an investigation, without delay, into the allegations relating to  cases (up to April ) that have not been resolved by the authorities of illegal invasion of lands in the states of Anzotegui, Apure, Barinas, Bolvar, Carabobo, Cojidas, Falcn, Gurico, Lora, Mrida, Miranda, Monagas, Portuguesa, Sucre, Taclira, Trujillo, Yanacuy and Zulia, and requests that, in the case of expropriations, it fully respect the legislation laid down and the relevant procedures;- to urgently carry out an independent investigation (by people in whom the workers' and employers' confederations have confidence) into the violent paramilitary groups mentioned in the allegations (Coordinadora Simn Bolvar, Tupamaros movements and Crculos Bolivarianos Armados, Quinta Repblica, Juventud Revolucionaria del MVR, Frente Institucional Militar and Fuerza Bolivariana) with a view to dismantling and disarming them and that it ensure that there are no clashes or confrontations between these groups and protesters in demonstrations, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.In a general way, the Committee expresses its serious concern about these allegations and at the poor situation of the rights of employers' organizations, their representatives and their members. The Committee draws the Government s attention to the fact that ""the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations"" [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee also underlines that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, due process and the protection of premises and property belonging to workers' and employers' organizations, are fully respected and guaranteed. The Committee urges the Government to fully guarantee these principles in the future.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following recommendations:(a) In a general way, the Committee wishes to underline the seriousness of the allegations and it regrets that, in spite of the fact that the complaints",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
213,"were presented in March , the Government s reply, dated  March , does not give specific replies to a large number of the allegations.(b) Taking into account the nature of the allegations presented and the Government s reply, the Committee expresses generally its serious concern about the poor situation of the rights of employers' organizations, their representatives and their members. The Committee draws the Government s attention to the fact that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations; the Committee also underlines that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, due process and the protection of premises and property belonging to workers' and employers' organizations, are fully respected and guaranteed. The Committee urges the Government to fully guarantee these principles in the future.(c) The Committee regrets that the Government has not convened the National Tripartite Commission for a number of years and that it usually does not carry out bipartite or tripartite consultations with FEDECAMARAS regarding policy-making or legislation that has a fundamental effect on its interests in labour, social or economic matters, thereby violating the basic rights of this employers' confederation; the Committee urges the Government to stop marginalizing and excluding FEDECAMARAS from social dialogue and, in future, to fully apply the ILO Constitution and the principles therein on consultation and tripartism. The Committee also urges the Government, without delay, to convene periodically the National Tripartite Commission and to examine in this context, together with the social partners, laws and orders adopted without tripartite consultation.(d) In the current critical situation facing the country and noting that there has for years existed a permanent conflict between the Government, on the one hand, and FEDECAMARAS and the CTV, on the other, the Committee offers the Government the services of the ILO to provide the State and society with its experience so that the authorities and the social partners may regain trust and, in a climate of mutual respect, establish a system of labour relations based on the principles of the ILO Constitution and of its fundamental Conventions, as well as the full recognition, in all its consequences, of the most representative confederations and all organizations and significant trends in the labour world.(e) The Committee urges the Government to reinstate FEDENGA to the Agricultural and Livestock Council and to stop favouring CONFAGAN to the detriment of FEDENGA.(f) The Committee considers that the arrest of Carlos Fernndez, President of FEDECAMARAS, as well as being discriminatory, aimed to neutralize or act as retaliation against this employers' official for his activities in defence of employers' interests and, therefore, it urges the Government to take all possible steps to annul immediately the judicial proceedings against Carlos Fernndez and to ensure that he may return to Venezuela without delay and without risk of reprisal; the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee deeply deplores the arrest of this employers' official and emphasizes that the arrest of employers' officials for reasons linked to actions relating to legitimate demands is a serious restriction of their rights and a violation of freedom of association, and requests the Government to respect this principle; the Committee also requests the Government to take steps to carry out an investigation into how the police carried out the arrest of Carlos Fernndez, his being imprisoned and held incommunicado for a day and the type of cell in which he was imprisoned, and to keep it informed in this respect.(g) With regard to the allegations relating to the application of the new system of exchange control in  (suspension of free buying and selling of currencies) unilaterally established by the authorities, discriminating against companies belonging to FEDECAMARAS in the administrative authorization for the purchase of foreign currencies (in retaliation for its participation in the national civic work stoppages); having taken account of the alleged discrimination and serious difficulties expressed by the complainant organizations because of the negative impact in many industries of this system, the Committee requests the Government to examine with FEDECAMARAS, without delay, the possibility of modifying the current system and that it guarantee, meanwhile, in case of complaints, the application of this system without discrimination of any sort, through impartial bodies. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(h) The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures without delay:(i) to ensure that the authorities do not try to intimidate, pressure or threaten employers and their organizations for their activities with regard to legitimate demands, in particular in the communications and in the agro-industrial sectors;(ii) to carry out, without delay, an investigation with regard to: () the acts of vandalism at the premises of the Lasa Chamber of Commerce by Bolivarian groups supporting the regime ( December ); () the looting of the office of Julio Brazn, president of CONSECOMERCIO ( February ); () the threats of violence on  October  by alleged members of the government political party against Adip Anka, president of the Bejuma Chamber of Commerce;(iii) to carry out an investigation, without delay, into the allegations relating to  cases (up to April ) that have not been resolved by the authorities of illegal invasion of lands in the states of Anzotegui, Apure, Barinas, Bolvar, Carabobo, Cojidas, Falcn, Gurico, Lora, Mrida, Miranda, Monagas, Portuguesa, Sucre, Taclira, Trujillo, Yanacuy and Zulia, and requests that, in the case of expropriations, it fully respect the legislation laid down and the relevant procedures; and(iv) to urgently carry out an independent investigation (by people in whom the workers' and employers' confederations have confidence) into the violent paramilitary groups mentioned in the allegations (Coordinadora Simn Bolvar, Tupamaros movements and Crculos Bolivarianos Armados, Quinta Repblica, Juventud Revolucionaria del MVR, Frente Institucional Militar and Fuerza Bolivariana) with a view to dismantling and disarming them, and that it ensure that there are no clashes or confrontations between these groups and protestors in demonstrations, and to keep it informed in this respect.",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
214,".At its June  meeting, the Committee asked that the requested information be sent as a matter of urgency and without delay on the pending matters. A summary of these conclusions and recommendations are set out below [see th Report, paras ' ]:' As regards the request to vacate the detention orders against Horacio Medina, Edgar Quijano, Ivn Fernndez, Mireya Repanti, Gonzalo Feijoo, Juan Luis Santana and Lino Castillo, the Government reports that on  December , the Office of the rd Prosecutor of the Office of the Public Prosecutor (the national body with competence to handle cases involving corruption, banks, insurance and capital markets), under the responsibility of lawyer Daniel Medina, submitted an indictment against Juan Antonio Fernndez Gmez, Horacio Francisco Medina Herrera and Mireya Ripanti de Amaya for committing the offences of civil rebellion, incitement to commit an offence, incitement to break the law and advocating criminal conduct, unlawful interruption of the gas supply, criminal conspiracy and computer espionage, and requested preventive judicial detention. On  December of the same year, a warrant was requested for the arrest of Gonzalo Feijoo Martnez, Edgar Quijano Luengo, Juan Luis Santana Lpez, Edgar Paredes Villegas and Juan Lino Carrillo Urdaneta; the application was granted on the same day, along with the request for preventive judicial detention. Accordingly, as is clear from the above, the competent Office of the Public Prosecutor issued these orders for enforcement by the police; however, the persons concerned are now fugitives from justice. Once again, the Committee recalls that the right to strike in the petroleum sector should be recognized, and considers that it is for the Government to prove in each individual case that an offence has been committed involving the overstepping of trade union rights by the union members concerned. The Committee considers that as this has not been done so far, the union officers and members concerned should be able to return to the country with government assurances that they will not be subject to reprisals. The Committee notes with concern the allegation by UNAPETROL relating to the fabrication of evidence against its officers and requests the Government to send its observations in this regard.' As regards the situation of members of the UNAPETROL trade union, the Government indicates that these former PDVSA employees, who set up UNAPETROL and were senior and middle managers of the oil company, were the same individuals who were involved in the coup d at in , rejecting the PDVSA board of directors, which had been legally appointed in accordance with the Petroleum Act (Official Gazette No.  of  November ), and who instigated the illegal and unconstitutional paralysis of the oil industry. Thus, as already stated, the lawful procedures prescribed by law for such cases were instituted against these workers, who participated in illegal activities incompatible with their functions and duties under the employment relationship, and who therefore could hardly be reinstated in the PDVSA today in posts which they are not lawfully entitled to occupy. The Committee reiterates its recommendation above on the legitimacy of the strike in the oil industry and considers that, until the Government has proved in each individual case that offences were committed, the union members should be reinstated in their posts.' Concerning the alleged reassessment of the dismissal of Gustavo Silva, the Government states that the archives of the Directorate of the National Inspectorate for the Public Sector do not contain any record of proceedings for misconduct against Gustavo Silva; accordingly, no decision has been adopted in this regard. The Government thus requires further information in order to address this request by the Committee on Freedom of Association. The Committee requests the complainant to provide its observations on this matter.' As regards the case of Cecilia Palma, the Government states that the applicable disciplinary proceedings prescribed by law were instituted against this person, culminating in an administrative decision on  November  issued by the competent authority, duly motivated with sufficient grounds. The official concerned was dismissed from her post as lawyer with the National Nutrition Institute on legal grounds of  lack of integrity, acts of violence, insult, insubordination, immoral conduct at work or act detrimental to the reputation or interests of the institution of the Republic concerned'  The judicial authority rejected the remedy of annulment filed by Ms Cecilia Palma against the decision by the administrative authority, considering that she had displayed an extremely serious lack of integrity unrelated to the exercise of trade union rights. There is no record of Ms Palma having filed any other appeals. The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the administrative and judicial decisions in this matter.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government states with respect to the requests to vacate the detention orders against Horacio Medina, Edgar Quijano, Ivn Fernndez, Mireya Repanti, Gonzalo Feijoo, Juan Luis Santana and Lino Castillo, that in , the Office of the Public Prosecutor initiated the respective procedure against these individuals and submitted an indictment for committing the offences of civil rebellion, incitement to commit an offence, incitement to break the law and advocating criminal conduct, unlawful interruption of the gas supply, criminal conspiracy and computer espionage, and requested preventive judicial detention. However, these individuals are now fugitives from justice. The Government emphatically states that the right to strike in all sectors is not only recognized in the country, but also protected by the Constitution and the laws of the Republic. Article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela establishes the right of all public and private sector workers to strike, subject to the conditions laid down by law. The Labour Act provides broad protection for labour and social rights in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; it specifically establishes the right that the State grants to workers, employers and their organizations, to collective bargaining and to strike (articles  and ), enabling them to exercise the right to bargain collectively and to peacefully solve conflicts. The Constitution itself establishes that strikes must be conducted in accordance with the law and must not cause irreparable damage to the people or institutions (article  of the Labour Act). Moreover, workers involved in lawful activities associated with a labour dispute may not be dismissed, transferred or subjected to a worsening in their conditions of work or have any measure taken against them, as stipulated in article  of the Act in question. National laws regulate illicit and unlawful conduct targeting the population or institutions and causing irreparable damage or consequences, and consequently fulfil the State s obligation to protect the rights of the country s citizens. Therefore, the regulation and sanction of illicit conduct cannot in any way be perceived to be reprisals by the Government against citizens whose actions or conduct classify as offences in the legislation.
.In the specific case of the abovementioned citizens ' the Government goes on to say ' the Public Prosecutor issued the respective indictments and initiated legal proceedings for the alleged offences. In other words a procedure was initiated to individually try the alleged criminal acts. However, the accused individuals' obstruction of justice meant no official conclusions could be reached and they could not be found either innocent or guilty. On another matter, the Government has nothing to say with respect to the baseless charge by UNAPETROL concerning the alleged fabrication of evidence against the officers of that organization. The Government suggests that the Committee on Freedom of Association ask the complainants to provide proof of their claims. All that remains is to confirm the full exercise in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of the rights to strike and to peaceful assembly, and the lack of any restrictions to those rights or to lawful industrial action, other than those established in national legislation.
.Concerning the situation of members of the UNAPETROL trade union, with regard to which the Committee reiterates its recommendation regarding the legitimacy of the strike in the oil industry, the Government repeats the information provided in the previous point of this reply concerning the recognition and protection of the right to strike in the country.
.With respect to the case of Cecilia Palma, the Government sends a copy of a ruling handed down by the Second Administrative Disputes Court dated  August .
.The Committee notes the Government s comments concerning the alleged fabrication of evidence against the officers of UNAPETROL in which it suggests that the complainant organizations provide proof of their claims. The Committee invites the complainant organizations to justify their allegation with the proof available to them.
.The Committee regrets that the complainant organizations have not provided information concerning the alleged reassessment of the dismissal of trade unionist Gustavo Silva and advises that in the absence of that information it will not pursue the analysis of these allegations in its next examination of the case.
.With regard to the dismissal of the FEDEUNEP trade unionist Ms Cecilia Palma (removal owing to lack of integrity, insult and insubordination), the Committee notes the ruling handed down",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
215,"by the Second Administrative Disputes Court dated  August , from which it can be gathered that the grounds for her removal, over and above the pursuit of trade union activities, related to actions and insults in a context of political confrontation.
.At its June  meeting, the Committee regretted that, despite the seriousness of the case, the Government had not sent information relating to the recommendations it had made since its March  meeting. It therefore reiterated the recommendations and requested the Government to send the information requested as a matter of urgency. Those recommendations are set out below [see th Report, paras ' ]:' bearing in mind the importance of due process of law being respected, the Committee trusts that the trade union leader, Carlos Ortega, will be released without delay and requests the Government to send it the decision handed down by the authority hearing the appeal. The Committee also requests the Government to send it a copy of the sentence handed down by the court of first instance (with all the reasons and conclusions therefor) in respect of the trade union leader Carlos Ortega (the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) has only sent a copy of the record of the public hearing at which the decision of the court and the sentence were made public);' the Committee requests the Government to recognize FEDEUNEP and to take steps to ensure that it is not the object of discrimination in social dialogue and in collective bargaining, particularly in the light of the fact that it is affiliated to the CTV ' another organization that has encountered problems of recognition which the Committee has already examined in the context of this case. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any invitation it sends to FEDEUNEP in the context of social dialogue. The Committee recalls the principle that both the government authorities and employers should refrain from any discrimination between trade union organizations, especially as regards recognition of their leaders who seek to perform legitimate trade union activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fourth edition, , para. ];' with regard to the dismissal of over , workers from the PDVSA and its subsidiaries in  for having taken part in a strike during the national civic work stoppage, the Committee notes the Government?s statements, and specifically that only  per cent of the appeals lodged with the labour inspectorate and other judicial authority have not yet been ruled upon. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has disregarded its recommendation that it enter into negotiations with the most representative workers? federations in order to find a solution to the dismissals at the PDVSA and its subsidiaries as a result of the organization of or participation in a strike during the national civic work stoppage. The Committee reiterates this recommendation;' the Committee calls on the Government to take steps to vacate the detention orders against the officials and members of the National Union of Oil, Gas, Petrochemical and Refinery Workers (UNAPETROL), Horacio Medina, Edgar Quijano, Ivn Fernndez, Mireya Repanti, Gonzalo Feijoo, Juan Luis Santana and Lino Castillo, and to keep it informed in this respect;' the Committee considers that the founders and members of UNAPETROL should be reinstated in their jobs since, in addition to the fact that they were participating in a civic work stoppage, they were dismissed while they were undergoing training;' with regard to the alleged acts of violence, arrests and torture by the military on  January  against a group of workers from the PDVSA enterprise ' leaders of the Beverage Industry Union of the State of Carabobo ' who were protesting against the raiding of the enterprise and the confiscation of its assets, which was a threat to their source of work, the Committee notes that the complaints submitted by Jos Gallardo, Jhonathan Rivas, Juan Carlos Zavala and Ramn Daz are currently under investigation and stresses that the allegations refer to the detention and torture of these workers, as well as of Faustino Villamediana. While regretting that the proceedings currently pending at the Office of the Attorney-General with respect to four workers have not been concluded despite the fact that the events go back to December  or January , the Committee firmly hopes that the authorities will rapidly conclude the investigations and requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision that is taken;' the Committee requests the Government to send it the decision adopted by the labour inspectorate regarding the reassessment of the dismissal of trade unionist Gustavo Silva and draws attention to the delays in the conduct of these proceedings;' with regard to the dismissal of FEDEUNEP trade unionist Cecilia Palma, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether she has appealed against the ruling of  September  and, if so, to keep it informed of the outcome of her appeal; and' in general, the Committee deeply regrets the excessive delay in the administration of justice with regard to several aspects of this case and emphasizes that justice delayed is justice denied and that this situation prevents the trade unions and their members from exercising their rights effectively.
.In addition, the Committee trusted that the Government would cooperate fully with the procedure and would respond in detail to the questions that had been asked [see th Report, para. ] and invited the complainant organizations to communicate any relevant information on the matters that were pending [see th Report, para. ].
.Lastly, the Committee requested the Government to respond specifically to the allegations by UNAPETROL, which were submitted in its communications of  March and  September .
.The complainant organization, UNAPETROL, had indicated that the auditing body of the PDVSA had summoned around  dismissed workers ' including union officials ' who had participated in the '  work stoppage in the petroleum sector as part of investigations into the losses of millions of dollars incurred during the stoppage. According to UNAPETROL, these were undefined and vague accusations, which lacked proof, and were another example of anti-union persecution.
.UNAPETROL added that the public summons issued by the enterprise put forward conclusions relating to the national civic work stoppage which were not within its remit, when stating that  an analysis of the information contained in the written and audiovisual mass media showed that the prerequisites for workers to initiate strike procedures were not met  ?
.The complainant organization noted furthermore that there was a substantial amount of proof, which was duly presented to the Attorney-General s Office ' as well as records of public statements made by UNAPETROL spokespersons and public hearings in which they participated ' relating to inappropriate operational procedures, acts of negligence, incompetence and the use of physical violence at various operational sites of the enterprise just after the dismissals had taken place and once members of the national armed forces had taken control of the facilities, and that this proof attests to the absolute innocence of all the dismissed workers. The evidence has been completely overlooked and ignored by the Tax Auditor s Office, the PDVSA Operational Audit Unit and even the Attorney-General s Office. In this connection, UNAPETROL had enclosed the following:' copies of the document presented by a group of lawyers and representatives of these workers to the Attorney-General s Office in April , containing certificates of safe transfer for installations that were later found to be damaged, once officials of the regime had taken control of operations; and' documents presented to the Tax Auditor s Office and the PDVSA Operational Audit Unit by Vctor Ramos and Horacio Medina, the Internal Control Secretary and the President of UNAPETROL, who were summoned to meetings on  and  December , respectively. According to UNAPETROL, the documents demonstrate how these workers were subjected to an act of persecution and retaliation while they were totally defenceless. Furthermore, union officials Edgar Quijano and Rodolfo Moreno, the Labour Assistance Secretary and the Vice-President of the disciplinary tribunal of UNAPETROL, were publicly summoned to meetings on  April and  June ; Horacio Medina, President of UNAPETROL, was also summoned.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that the former President of the CTV, Mr Carlos Ortega, was convicted of the offences of civil rebellion, incitement to break the law and fraudulent use of a public document, for having deliberately urged the population to subvert public order, refrain from paying taxes or social security contributions, and engage in civil disobedience and rebellion, obstructing traffic in the streets and the exercise of the right to health and education, among others, all with the aim of damaging the constitutional fabric, creating a chaotic situation conducive to those aims. He was therefore sentenced on  December  to  years and  months for civil rebellion, incitement to commit an offence and possession of false documents. Mr Carlos Ortega was serving his sentence in Ramo Verde military prison in Los Teques, where, despite the fact that",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
216,"he was serving a sentence for ordinary crimes, he also had opportunities to engage in leisure, entertainment and cultural activities, which are all permitted in this penitentiary establishment. However, on  August , Mr Carlos Ortega escaped from prison and is currently a fugitive from Venezuelan justice.
.Mr Ortega is now living in Peru, having been granted asylum by that country in . Based on the principles of sovereignty, independence and self-determination of peoples, the Venezuelan Government expressed its respect for that decision by the Peruvian Government. The Committee recalls that it has already examined these statements by the Government and the substance of the case and considered that Mr Ortega s conviction was related to his trade union activities, in particular national strikes and protest marches, at times involving the participation of over . million people, against the Government s economic and social policy. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that this trade union officer can return to the country without fear of reprisals.
.As regards the situation of the National Single Federation of Public Employees (FEDEUNEP), the Government states that the Federation last held elections to its executive committee on  October , as attested by the certification of validity of the elections issued by the National Electoral Council (CNE) on  July  and published in Electoral Gazette No.  of  January . According to FEDEUNEP s by-laws, its executive committee is elected for a term of five years, and has therefore been in a situation of electoral default since  October .
.Subsequently, on  February , a draft framework collective agreement was submitted to the Directorate of the National Inspectorate for the Public Sector by the union s representative. On  July of the same year, the National Inspectorate made its comments on the draft so that any omissions or deficiencies could be rectified within  working days of its notification, as prescribed by law. The main observation was the fact that the members of the Federation s executive committee had allowed their term of office to expire, having been elected until  October , and were thus in a situation described in our country as  electoral default' and could only carry out simple administrative and operational activities so as to ensure that members' rights were protected, but were barred from engaging in or representing the members in collective bargaining or disputes. Section  of the Regulations under the Organic Labour Act provides that members of trade union executive committees whose term of office has expired may not engage in, conduct or represent the organization in acts that go beyond simple administration.
.For the above reasons, the Government states that the executive committee of FEDEUNEP is not authorized to negotiate the draft framework agreement submitted, since the term of office of its members has expired and they have provided no proof of having held another election to remedy the situation. Once the situation has been remedied, negotiations will begin on the draft collective agreement, in accordance with the legislation in force and in full conformity with ILO Convention No. .
.The Committee recalls that on numerous occasions it has objected to the role of the CNE, which is not a judicial body, in the elections of trade union executive committees, as constituting interference by the authorities. The present report, in the cases concerning the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, sets forth in detail the criticism levelled by all of the supervisory bodies against the interference in elections by the CNE, as well as the legislation which results in barring trade unions whose executive committees are not recognized by that body from collective bargaining. The Committee reiterates its conclusions and recommendations relating to those cases and urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the CNE does not interfere in trade union elections.
.As regards the allegations of government discrimination, the Government believes that previous replies have demonstrated to the ILO all the actions taken attesting to the Government s interest in, unequivocal practice of and willingness to promote collective bargaining, freedom of association and broad and inclusive social dialogue, without excluding or discriminating against any organization or trade union. Moreover, the Government has maintained and continues to maintain dialogue and negotiations with the small and medium-sized enterprise sectors, which had historically been excluded from political, economic and social decision-making, formerly the preserve of a group of employers or organizations, within a highly monopolistic and oligopolic structure subordinate to transnational interests, in which the people s interests were relegated to the sidelines.
.The Committee notes that, by not submitting its trade union elections to control by the CNE, FEDEUNEP is prevented by the legislation from engaging in collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government not to discriminate against FEDEUNEP under the pretext that it does not submit to regulation by the CNE and to guarantee its right to bargain collectively.
.As regards the strike by the PDVSA and dismissals of workers, the Government reiterates that in , PDVSA senior and middle managers, some political parties and dissenting elements in the national armed forces had called an indefinite nationwide work stoppage with the aim of overthrowing the democratically elected president and destabilizing the Republic socially and economically. This illegal and unconstitutional work stoppage was essentially sustained by a total paralysis of the oil industry called by the former PDVSA employees through various media. The stoppage was nothing but an act of sabotage of the national economy and an illegal paralysis of the oil industry; it was not motivated by workers' demands, whether legal or contractual; it was a stoppage which had major serious repercussions on the country s social, political and economic situation.
.Far from being a legal civic work stoppage, as the complainants would have us believe and are still claiming, this stoppage called by former PDVSA senior and middle managers and members of organizations such as FEDECAMARAS and the CTV led to closures of businesses and enterprises and paralysed basic services, reducing the capacity of society to meet the needs of the Venezuelan population with respect to health care, education and food, among others, and prompting a crisis of considerable magnitude and repercussions, with the aim of bringing our main industry to its knees, destabilizing the country economically, politically and socially, and overthrowing the President of the Republic democratically elected by the people.
.Accordingly, justified dismissal proceedings were instituted on various grounds set forth in section  of the Organic Labour Act against certain workers and managers of the PDVSA for having committed acts which are contrary to the due integrity they are bound to maintain as workers of this State enterprise, having participated in the unconstitutional and illegal paralysis of the enterprise s activities in December  and January, February and March . These actions by former workers were not based on the Constitution or on the national or international legislation in force, neither were they motivated by labour demands or rights; on the contrary, they involved the public and general interest and seriously damaged the nation and the population, affecting society and the State, with repercussions on the normal development of the economic and social life of the Republic. The Venezuelan State did not take any retaliatory action against these workers, or against anyone else who participated in the work stoppage of the national enterprise, whose economic activity makes a vital contribution in terms of earnings to the public objectives of the State. Instead, the state authorities fully discharged their duty to dispense justice in an impartial, appropriate, transparent, independent, responsible and fair manner, in the cases in which acts were found to have been committed which were contrary to the fundamental obligations inherent in the employment relationship, as well as serious and wilful misconduct, not only with regard to the enterprise but with regard to the nation and hence the Venezuelan people.
.The Government indicates that its foregoing statements concerning the procedure followed with regard to the former PDVSA employees, in compliance with all the requirements of the law and due process, also constitute a reply to the allegations on the summonses issued by the auditing body of the enterprise and the alleged evidence presented by UNAPETROL concerning the illegal and unconstitutional work stoppage in the oil industry.
.The Committee recalls that it has already examined the substance of this allegation; it considered that the right to strike should be recognized in the petroleum sector and regrets that the Government has disregarded its previous recommendation that it enter into negotiations with the most representative workers' federations in order to find a solution to the dismissals at the PDVSA and its subsidiaries. The Committee recalls that the dismissals were due to a strike and that they affected over , workers. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations.
.As regards the request to vacate the detention orders against Horacio Medina, Edgar Quijano, Ivn Fernndez, Mireya Repanti, Gonzalo Feijoo, Juan Luis Santana and Lino Castillo, the Government reports that on  December , the Office of the rd Prosecutor of the Office of the",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
217,"Public Prosecutor (the national body with competence to handle cases involving corruption, banks, insurance and capital markets), under the responsibility of lawyer Daniel Medina, submitted an indictment against Juan Antonio Fernndez Gmez, Horacio Francisco Medina Herrera and Mireya Ripanti de Amaya for committing the offences of civil rebellion, incitement to commit an offence, incitement to break the law and advocating criminal conduct, unlawful interruption of the gas supply, criminal conspiracy and computer espionage, and requested preventive judicial detention. On  December of the same year, a warrant was requested for the arrest of Gonzalo Feijoo Martnez, Edgar Quijano Luengo, Juan Luis Santana Lpez, Edgar Paredes Villegas and Juan Lino Carrillo Urdaneta; the application was granted on the same day, along with the request for preventive judicial detention. Accordingly, as is clear from the above, the competent Office of the Public Prosecutor issued these orders for enforcement by the police; however, the persons concerned are now fugitives from justice.
.Once again, the Committee recalls that the right to strike in the petroleum sector should be recognized, and considers that it is for the Government to prove in each individual case that an offence has been committed involving the overstepping of trade union rights by the union members concerned. The Committee considers that as this has not been done so far, the union officers and members concerned should be able to return to the country with government assurances that they will not be subject to reprisals. The Committee notes with concern the allegation by UNAPETROL relating to the fabrication of evidence against its officers and requests the Government to send its observations in this regard.
.As regards the situation of members of the UNAPETROL trade union, the Government indicates that these former PDVSA employees, who set up UNAPETROL and were senior and middle managers of the oil company, were the same individuals who were involved in the coup d at in , rejecting the PDVSA board of directors, which had been legally appointed in accordance with the Petroleum Act (Official Gazette No.  of  November ), and who instigated the illegal and unconstitutional paralysis of the oil industry. Thus, as already stated, the lawful procedures prescribed by law for such cases were instituted against these workers, who participated in illegal activities incompatible with their functions and duties under the employment relationship, and who therefore could hardly be reinstated in the PDVSA today in posts which they are not lawfully entitled to occupy.
.The Committee reiterates its recommendation above on the legitimacy of the strike in the oil industry and considers that, until the Government has proved in each individual case that offences were committed, the union members should be reinstated in their posts.
.As regards the situation of PANAMCO de Venezuela SA, the Government states that this enterprise was in fact legally raided by the National Guard, in accordance with the Consumer and User Protection Act and on the basis of a court order, because it had been hoarding foodstuffs, which it had also done during the illegal and unconstitutional work stoppage held in December . During the procedure carried out in the enterprise, it was found to be illegally hoarding basic staple foods which had been withdrawn from the market at the time on account of the hoarding practices of certain enterprises. The competent authorities did not use violence or exceed their powers when they carried out this measure; on the contrary, the National Guard peacefully abided by the legal requirements, despite hostile and aggressive acts by groups from outside the enterprise, who took it upon themselves to violently assault National Guard officers performing their duty to protect the interests of the population. As a result, the National Guard officers had to protect the integrity of the officials who were enforcing the court order and safeguarding the public order. This is not intended to justify the use of force or coercion by state bodies, but merely to explain that their powers and duties include ensuring security and the public order and protecting citizens against acts of violence.
.The Government adds that according to information provided by the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic, on  May  the th Prosecutor of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the national body with full competence at the time, applied to the Third Court of First Instance, acting as overseeing court for the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the state of Carabobo, requesting a dismissal of proceedings under section () of the Code of Penal Procedure, read in conjunction with section  of the Penal Code, which was ordered on  July . Under section  of the Code of Penal Procedure, dismissal of proceedings  terminates the proceedings and has the authority of res judicata, thus preventing any further prosecution of the defendant or accused against whom proceedings have been dismissed, except where otherwise provided in section  of this Code, and all the measures of restraint ordered shall be lifted'  The Committee concludes that penal proceedings have been dismissed and can only regret the measures taken against the enterprise and some of its employees.
.Concerning the alleged reassessment of the dismissal of Gustavo Silva, the Government states that the archives of the Directorate of the National Inspectorate for the Public Sector do not contain any record of proceedings for misconduct against Gustavo Silva; accordingly, no decision has been adopted in this regard. The Government thus requires further information in order to address this request by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Committee requests the complainant to provide its observations on this matter.
.As regards the case of Cecilia Palma, the Government states that the applicable disciplinary proceedings prescribed by law were instituted against this person, culminating in an administrative decision on  November  issued by the competent authority, duly motivated with sufficient grounds. The official concerned was dismissed from her post as lawyer with the National Nutrition Institute on legal grounds of  lack of integrity, acts of violence, insult, insubordination, immoral conduct at work or act detrimental to the reputation or interests of the institution of the Republic concerned'  The judicial authority rejected the remedy of annulment filed by Ms Cecilia Palma against the decision by the administrative authority, considering that she had displayed extremely serious lack of integrity unrelated to the exercise of trade union rights. There is no record of Ms Palma having filed any other appeals.
.The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the administrative and judicial decisions in this matter.
.At its March  session, the Committee regretted that, despite the seriousness of the case, the Government had not sent information relating to the recommendations that it had made at its March  session and which it therefore reiterated. Those recommendations are set out below [see th Report, para. ]:' bearing in mind the importance of due process of law being respected, the Committee trusts that the trade union leader, Carlos Ortega, will be released without delay and requests the Government to send it the decision handed down by the authority hearing the appeal. The Committee also requests the Government to send it a copy of the sentence handed down by the court of first instance (with all the reasons and conclusions therefor) in respect of the trade union leader Carlos Ortega (the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) has only sent a copy of the record of the public hearing at which the decision of the court and the sentence were made public);' the Committee requests the Government to recognize FEDEUNEP and to take steps to ensure that it is not the object of discrimination in social dialogue and in collective bargaining, particularly in the light of the fact that it is affiliated to the CTV ' another organization that has encountered problems of recognition which the Committee has already examined in the context of this case. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any invitation it sends to FEDEUNEP in the context of social dialogue. The Committee recalls the principle that both the government authorities and employers should refrain from any discrimination between trade union organizations, especially as regards recognition of their leaders who seek to perform legitimate trade union activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fourth edition, , para. ];' with regard to the dismissal of over , workers from the PDVSA and its subsidiaries in  for having taken part in a strike during the national civic work stoppage, the Committee notes the Government s statements, and specifically that only  per cent of the appeals lodged with the labour inspectorate and other judicial authority have not yet been ruled upon. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has disregarded its recommendation that it enter into negotiations with the most representative workers' federations in order to find a solution to the dismissals at the PDVSA and its subsidiaries as a result of the organization of or participation in a strike during the national civic work stoppage. The",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
218,"Committee reiterates this recommendation;' the Committee calls on the Government to take steps to vacate the detention orders against the officials and members of the National Union of Oil, Gas, Petrochemical and Refinery Workers (UNAPETROL), Horacio Medina, Edgar Quijano, Ivn Fernndez, Mireya Repanti, Gonzalo Feijoo, Juan Luis Santana and Lino Castillo, and to keep it informed in this respect;' the Committee considers that the founders and members of UNAPETROL should be reinstated in their jobs since, in addition to the fact that they were participating in a civic work stoppage, they were dismissed while they were undergoing training;' with regard to the alleged acts of violence, arrests and torture by the military on  January  against a group of workers from the PDVSA enterprise ' leaders of the Beverage Industry Union of the State of Carabobo ' who were protesting against the raiding of the enterprise and the confiscation of its assets, which was a threat to their source of work, the Committee notes that the complaints submitted by Jos Gallardo, Jhonathan Rivas, Juan Carlos Zavala and Ramn Daz are currently under investigation and stresses that the allegations refer to the detention and torture of these workers, as well as of Faustino Villamediana. While regretting that the proceedings currently pending at the Office of the Attorney-General with respect to four workers have not been concluded despite the fact that the events go back to December  or January , the Committee firmly hopes that the authorities will rapidly conclude the investigations and requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision that is taken;' the Committee requests the Government to send it the decision adopted by the labour inspectorate regarding the reassessment of the dismissal of trade unionist Gustavo Silva and draws attention to the delays in the conduct of these proceedings;' with regard to the dismissal of FEDEUNEP trade unionist Cecilia Palma, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether she has appealed against the ruling of  September  and, if so, to keep it informed of the outcome of her appeal; and' in general, the Committee deeply regrets the excessive delay in the administration of justice with regard to several aspects of this case and emphasizes that justice delayed is justice denied and that this situation prevents the trade unions and their members from exercising their rights effectively.
.Furthermore, at its March  session, the Committee urged the Government to send the requested information urgently and without delay, and to give effect to those recommendations [see th Report, para. ].
.Furthermore, the Committee requested the Government to respond specifically to the following allegations by UNAPETROL, which were submitted in its communications of  March and  September . The complainant organization UNAPETROL indicated that the auditing body of the PDVSA summoned around  dismissed workers ' including union officials ' who participated in the '  work stoppage in the petroleum sector as part of investigations into the losses of millions of dollars incurred during the stoppage. According to UNAPETROL, these were undefined and vague accusations, which lacked proof, and were another example of anti-union persecution.
.UNAPETROL added that the public summons issued by the enterprise put forward conclusions relating to the national civic work stoppage which were not within its remit, when stating that  an analysis of the information contained in the written and audiovisual mass media showed that the prerequisites for workers to initiate strike procedures were not met  ?
.The complainant organization noted furthermore that there was a substantial amount of proof, which was duly presented to the Attorney-General s Office ' as well as records of public statements made by UNAPETROL spokespersons and public hearings in which they participated ' relating to inappropriate operational procedures, acts of negligence, incompetence and the use of physical violence at various operational sites of the enterprise just after the dismissals had taken place and once members of the national armed forces had taken control of the facilities, and that this proof attests to the absolute innocence of all the dismissed workers. The evidence has been completely overlooked and ignored by the Tax Auditor s Office, the PDVSA Operational Audit Unit and even the Attorney-General s Office. In this connection, UNAPETROL enclosed the following:' copies of the document presented by a group of lawyers and representatives of these workers to the Attorney-General s Office in April , containing certificates of safe transfer for installations that were later found to be damaged, once officials of the regime had taken control of operations; and' documents presented to the Tax Auditor s Office and the PDVSA Operational Audit Unit by Vctor Ramos and Horacio Medina, the internal control secretary and the president of UNAPETROL, who were summoned to meetings on  and  December , respectively. According to UNAPETROL, the documents demonstrate how these workers were subjected to an act of persecution and retaliation while they were totally defenceless. Furthermore, union officials Edgar Quijano and Rodolfo Moreno, the labour assistance secretary and the vice-president of the disciplinary tribunal of UNAPETROL, were publicly summoned to meetings on  April and  June ; Horacio Medina, president of UNAPETROL, was also summoned.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government reiterates the content of the communications that it has submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association on previous occasions ' since  February  ' especially Communication No. /, dated  October , in which it requested that the case be closed, as it considered that the statements and arguments it had provided in response to the Committee s requests were not only sufficient, relevant and sound but also demonstrated that those of the complainants were groundless. Lastly, the Government reiterates its request with regard to the appraisal of the allegations put forward by the parties in this case and the consideration and fair assessment of the information provided by the Government.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided the specific information that it requested in the recommendations that it made in March  and March , which it therefore reiterates. Furthermore, the Committee once again requests the Government to respond specifically to the allegations by UNAPETROL, which were submitted in its communications of  March and  September , given that it has merely reiterated information that has already been examined. Given the seriousness of the pending issues, the Committee ultimately trusts that the Government will fully cooperate with the procedure and will respond in detail to the questions that have been asked.
.Lastly, given the time that has elapsed since the presentation of the complaints and the Government s failure to communicate the requested information, the Committee invites the complainant organizations to communicate any relevant information on the matters that are pending.
.At its March  meeting, the Committee regretted that, despite the seriousness of the case, the Government had not sent information relating to the following recommendations [see th Report, paras ' ]:' bearing in mind the importance of due process of law being respected, the Committee trusts that the trade union leader, Carlos Ortega, will be released without delay and requests the Government to send it the decision handed down by the authority hearing the appeal. The Committee also requests the Government to send it a copy of the sentence handed down by the court of first instance (with all the reasons and conclusions therefor) in respect of the trade union leader Carlos Ortega (the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) has sent only a copy of the record of the public hearing at which the decision of the court and the sentence were made public);' the Committee requests the Government to recognize FEDEUNEP and to take steps to ensure that it is not the object of discrimination in social dialogue and in collective bargaining, particularly in the light of the fact that it is affiliated to the CTV ' another organization that has encountered problems of recognition which the Committee has already examined in the context of this case. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any invitation it sends to FEDEUNEP in the context of social dialogue. The Committee recalls the principle that both the government authorities and employers should refrain from any discrimination between trade union organizations, especially as regards recognition of their leaders who seek to perform legitimate trade union activities [see Digest, , para. ];' with regard to the dismissal of over , workers from PDVSA and its subsidiaries in  for having taken part in a strike during the national civic work stoppage, the Committee notes the Government s statements, and specifically that only  per cent of the appeals lodged with the labour inspectorate and other judicial authority have not yet been ruled upon. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has disregarded its recommendation that it enter into negotiations with the most representative workers' federations in order to find a solution to the dismissals at the PDVSA and its subsidiaries as a result of the organization of or participation",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
219,"in a strike during the national civic work stoppage. The Committee reiterates this recommendation;' the Committee calls on the Government to take steps to vacate the detention orders against the officials and members of UNAPETROL, Horacio Medina, Edgar Quijano, Ivn Fernndez, Mireya Repanti, Gonzalo Feijoo, Juan Luis Santana and Lino Castillo, and to keep it informed in this respect;' the Committee considers that the founders and members of UNAPETROL should be reinstated in their jobs since, in addition to the fact that they were participating in a civic work stoppage, they were dismissed while they were undergoing training;' with regard to the alleged acts of violence, arrests and torture by the military on  January  against a group of workers from the PDVSA enterprise ' leaders of the Beverage Industry Union of the State of Carabobo ' who were protesting against the raiding of the enterprise and the confiscation of its assets, which was a threat to their source of work, the Committee notes that the complaints submitted by Jos Gallardo, Jhonathan Rivas, Juan Carlos Zavala and Ramn Daz are currently under investigation and stresses that the allegations refer to the detention and torture of these workers, as well as of Faustino Villamediana. While regretting that the proceedings currently pending at the Office of the Attorney-General with respect to four workers have not been concluded despite the fact that the events go back to December  or January , the Committee firmly hopes that the authorities will rapidly conclude the investigations and requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision that is taken;' the Committee requests the Government to send it the decision adopted by the labour inspectorate regarding the reassessment of the dismissal of trade unionist Gustavo Silva and draws attention to the delays in the conduct of these proceedings;' with regard to the dismissal of FEDEUNEP trade unionist Cecilia Palma, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether she has appealed against the ruling of  September  and, if so, to keep it informed of the outcome of her appeal; and' in general, the Committee deeply regrets the excessive delay in the administration of justice with regard to several aspects of this case and emphasizes that justice delayed is justice denied and that this situation prevents the trade unions and their members from exercising their rights effectively.
.Furthermore, the Committee reiterated its previous recommendations and urged the Government to send the requested information urgently and without delay, and to give effect to these recommendations [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communications of  March and  September , the complainant, UNAPETROL, indicates that the auditing body of the PDVSA enterprise summoned around  dismissed workers ' including union officials ' who participated in the  work stoppage in the petroleum sector as part of investigations into the losses of millions of dollars incurred during the stoppage. According to UNAPETROL, these were undefined and vague accusations, which lacked proof, and are yet another example of anti-union persecution.
.UNAPETROL adds that the public summons issued by the enterprise puts forward conclusions relating to the national civic work stoppage which are not within its remit, when stating that  an analysis of the information contained in the written and audiovisual mass media showed that the prerequisites for workers to initiate strike procedures were not met  ?
.The complainant also points out that there is a substantial amount of proof, which was duly presented to the Attorney-General s Office ' as well as records of public statements made by UNAPETROL spokespersons and public hearings in which they participated ' relating to inappropriate operational procedures, acts of negligence, incompetence and the use of physical violence at various operational sites of the enterprise just after the dismissals had taken place and once members of the national armed forces had taken control of the facilities, and that this proof attests to the absolute innocence of all the dismissed workers. The evidence has been completely omitted and ignored by the Tax Auditor s Office, the PDVSA Operational Audit Unit and even the Attorney-General s Office. In this connection, UNAPETROL sent the following:' copies of the document presented by a group of lawyers and representatives of these workers to the Attorney-General s Office in April , containing certificates of safe transfer for installations that were later found to be damaged, once officials of the regime had taken control of operations; and' documents presented to the Tax Auditor s Office and the PDVSA Operational Audit Unit by Messrs Vctor Ramos and Horacio Medina, the internal control secretary and the president of UNAPETROL, who were summoned to meetings on  and  December , respectively. According to UNAPETROL, the documents demonstrate how these workers were subjected to an act of persecution and retaliation while they were totally defenceless. Furthermore, union officials Edgar Quijano and Rodolfo Moreno, the labour assistance secretary and the vice-president of the disciplinary tribunal of UNAPETROL, were publicly summoned to meetings on  April and  June ; Horacio Medina, president of UNAPETROL, was also summoned.
.Although UNAPETROL also alleges the further dismissal of over , workers by the PDVSA enterprise, it points out that these were politically motivated dismissals and related to the signing of the referendum on the recall of the President of the Republic (the Committee recalls that its remit covers anti-union dismissals only, and not politically motivated ones).
.In its communication of  May , the CTV refers to statements made by the President of the Republic, in which he said that  in the revolution, the differences between the trade unions and the revolutionary party must disappear; the trade unions must disappear'  and other statements attacking the independence of trade unions, such as:  If they want to be autonomous, then we will have tamed trade unions; they want their own guidelines and standards.' This attitude explains the continual interference by the authorities (the National Electoral Council, and so on) in union elections and in collective bargaining procedures.
.In its communications of  May and  September , the Government responds to the allegations made by the CTV by invoking the right of all citizens to freedom of speech and by pointing out that the statements were made at a meeting to swear in the supporters of a partisan political act to promote the formation of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and cannot, therefore, be considered as an official act; on the contrary, Hugo Chvez, as a citizen, was exercising his political and social rights and supporting the idea that a trade union organization must be the mouthpiece of a political party. Convention No.  and freedom of association enjoy excellent health in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, with the registration of  new trade unions so far that year. As it did in its reply during the previous examination of the case in March , the Government criticizes UNAPETROL for presenting allegations after allowing the proceedings initiated with the Supreme Court of Justice to lapse in May  through an absence of procedural activity for over one year (and that these proceedings referred to the refusal to register the organization). According to the Government, the case should be closed.
.The Committee notes this information from the Government concerning the new allegations made by the CTV. Nonetheless, the Committee recalls that the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted on  June  by the International Labour Conference, states that:  When trade unions in accordance with national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of the trade union movement or its social and economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country.' The Committee hopes that, in future, this principle will be taken fully into account.
.Lastly, the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided information relating to the recommendations which it formulated in March  and which it therefore reiterates. The Committee requests the Government to respond specifically to the allegations made by UNAPETROL in the communications of  March and  September , given that it has merely reiterated the information already given on the lapsing of the judicial proceedings concerning the refusal to register the organization.
.The National Union of Oil, Gas, Petrochemical and Refinery Workers (UNAPETROL) sent new allegations in communications dated  April,  June,  September and  December  and  February . The National Single Federation of Public Employees (FEDEUNEP) sent new allegations in a communication dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May, , , , ,  June,  October,  and  November , and  February, and  and  March .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
220,"of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) In general terms, the Committee notes with grave concern that the Government has not implemented its recommendations concerning a number of important issues that constitute very serious violations of trade union rights.(b) The Committee calls on the Government to take steps to have Carlos Ortega, president of THE CTV, released from detention and to vacate the detention orders against the officials and members of UNAPETROL, Horacio Medina, Edgar Quijano, Ivn Fernndez, Mireya Ripanti, Gonzalo Feijoo, Juan Lus Santana and Lino Castillo, and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.(c) The Committee deplores the mass anti-union dismissals that occurred at the PDVSA state enterprise and its subsidiaries and notes that only some  per cent of the cases of dismissal have been resolved and that, of those, , were resolved by the workers withdrawing their application and  were declared irreceivable or settled in favour of PDVSA, often on the grounds that the deadline had expired. The Committee considers that the delay of the courts in resolving the immense majority of the , dismissals (according to UNAPETROL) is tantamount to a denial of justice and does not in any way exclude the possibility that the cases were dropped precisely because of the excessive delay. The Committee once again urges the Government in the strongest of terms to enter into negotiations with the most representative trade union confederations in order to find a solution to the remaining instances of dismissal at PDVSA and its subsidiaries on account of the organization of or participation in a strike during the national civic work stoppage. The Committee considers that the founders and members of UNAPETROL should in any case be reinstated in their jobs, since in addition to participating in a civic work stoppage they were dismissed while they were undergoing training.(d) The Committee deeply regrets the enormous delay in the proceedings relating to the challenge to the trade union elections of , as well as the interference of the National Electoral Council in the elections of the executive committee of the CTV, and calls on the Government to ensure that in future the public authorities do not interfere in trade union elections and that only an independent judicial authority is involved in any annulment. The Committee calls on the Government to recognize the present executive committee for all purposes unless a ruling is handed down by an independent judicial authority that conducts a full inquiry into the holding of the previous election and concludes that it was not conducted in broad compliance with the law.(e) The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the appeal against the decision of the Minister of Labour denying UNAPETROL registration is currently before the Administrative Policy Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and requests the Government to send it the text of the ruling handed down. In the meantime, and in order to avoid the issue of the registration of UNAPETROL being held up still further by possible appeals or judicial delay, the Committee once again calls on the Government to initiate direct contacts with the members of UNAPETROL, so as to find a solution to the matter of its registration and determine how the legal shortcomings referred to by the Government can be corrected.(f) With regard to the alleged eviction from their homes of hundreds of former workers of PDVSA and its subsidiaries in a number of states of the country, the Committee regrets the acts of violence perpetrated against workers, the excessive delay in the administration of justice with regard to the dismissals and the fact that PDVSA s view of the just and legal nature of the dismissals, before the court proceedings have been completed, should have prevailed over the right of workers to keep their housing, thus causing irreparable harm to the workers and their families. Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government should have totally disregarded its recommendation that it examined the situation with the workers of PDVSA and its subsidiaries with a view to finding a solution to the problem of the eviction of hundreds of workers, thus abandoning the workers and their families to their fate.(g) With regard to the alleged written request sent by PDVSA for its subsidiaries and a Cypriot enterprise not to hire the dismissed workers, the Committee reminds the Government of its earlier request that it initiate an investigation without delay and requests that a proper hearing be given to the complainant organizations in the present case as well as to PDVSA and its subsidiaries and that, if the allegations are found to be true, that all such anti-union practices be stopped.(h) With regard to the alleged acts of violence, arrests and torture by the military on  January  against a group of workers from the Panamco de Venezuela S.A. enterprise, leaders of the Beverage Industry Union of the state of Carabobo, who were protesting against the raiding of the enterprise and the confiscation of its assets, which was a threat to their source of work, the Committee notes that the complaints submitted by Jos Gallardo, Jhonathan Rivas, Juan Carlos Zavala and Ramn Daz are currently under investigation and stresses that the allegations concern the detention and torture of these workers and of Faustino Villamediana. While regretting that the proceedings currently pending at the Office of the Attorney General with respect to four workers have not yet been concluded despite the fact that the events go back to December  or January , the Committee firmly hopes that the authorities will rapidly conclude the investigations and requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision that is taken.(i) The Committee requests the Government to send it the decision adopted by the labour inspectorate regarding the reassessment of the dismissal of trade unionist Gustavo Silva.(j) With regard to the dismissal of FEDEUNEP official Cecilia Palma, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether this trade unionist has appealed against the ruling of  September  and, if so, to keep it informed of the outcome of her appeal.(k) In general terms, the Committee regrets the excessive delay in the administration of justice demonstrated by several aspects of this case and stresses that justice delayed is justice denied, and that this situation impedes the effective exercise of the rights of trade union organizations and their members.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see rd Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )]. Additional information was sent by UNAPETROL with the support of CTV in a communication dated  April .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  March  and a communication dated  May , received while the Committee was meeting.
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its session in March , having examined the allegations in the present case, the Committee formulated the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the murder of the trade unionist Numar Ricardo Herrera, member of the Federation of Construction Workers, on  May , emphasizing that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to the murder. The Committee requests the Government to indicate clearly whether other workers were injured in the march that took place on  May , as asserted by the ICFTU, and if so, what legal action was taken.(b) With respect to the alleged acts of violence by the military on  January  against a group of workers from the Panamco de Venezuela S.A. enterprise, leaders of the Beverage Industry Union of the State of Carabobo, for protesting against the raid on the enterprise and the confiscation of its goods, which represented a threat to their jobs, the Committee deplores the acts of violence which occurred during the raid on the Panamco enterprise and urges the Government to institute an independent investigation without delay into the instances of detention and torture claimed by the CTV to have been suffered by workers Faustino Villamediana, Jorge Gregorio Flores Gallardo, Jhonathan Magdaleno Rivas, Juan Carlos Zavala and Ramn Daz. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed of the results.(c) As regards the allegation concerning the detention order against Mr. Carlos Ortega, president of the CTV, for the presumed perpetration of political offences during the ""national civic work stoppage"" (""treason"", ""incitement to crime"" and ""criminal damage"") without the",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
221,"guarantees of due process in view of a judge s lack of impartiality, and the allegations that the President of the Republic refuses to recognize the CTV leaders, promotes the establishment of a workers' confederation supportive of his party and makes hostile public statements against the CTV and its leaders in the context of the ""national civic work stoppage"" which began on  December , the Committee notes that the Government has sent its observations, received one day before its meeting. The Committee regrets the delay in the sending of that reply, which it intends to examine at its meeting in May-June .Allegations by UNAPETROL(d) With respect to the allegation concerning the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register UNAPETROL despite the fact that the relevant documentation was submitted on  July , and regarding the Ministry s request to the state enterprise PDVSA to describe the duties performed by the promoters of UNAPETROL, the Committee deplores the fact that the Ministry of Labour informed PDVSA of the names of the UNAPETROL members in order to determine who belonged to the management staff and who did not, as well as the fact that the administrative process has been delayed for so many months partly because of a judicial appeal by UNAPETROL but largely owing to delays in administrative proceedings and because it was not clearly stated what specific steps should be taken by UNAPETROL in order to be registered (for example, suggesting that the representative role of the managers be eliminated or, conversely, that that of the non-managers be eliminated). The Committee hopes that in future the procedure for trade union registration will be more rapid and more transparent and requests the Government to inform it of the steps it plans to take in this respect and initiate direct contact with the members of UNAPETROL in order to find a solution to the problem of registering the union. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(e) With regard to the alleged dismissal of more than , workers from PDVSA and its subsidiaries, including the members of UNAPETROL, since the start of the ""national civic work stoppage"" in December , the Committee deplores these mass dismissals, of a hasty and disproportionate nature, which affected , workers, and emphasizes the fact that mass penalties for trade union actions are tantamount to abuses and destroy labour relations. It requests the Government to inform it of the result of the legal action taken by the dismissed workers and to initiate negotiations with the most representative trade union confederations in order to find a solution to the mass dismissals which took place at PDVSA and its subsidiaries as a consequence of the ""national civic work stoppage"", and in particular with regard to the UNAPETROL members, to whom, moreover, article  of the Constitution should be applied, which states that the promoters and members of the executive committees of trade unions shall enjoy irremovability for the duration of, and under the conditions necessary for, the performance of their duties. It requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect and that it send its observations on the alleged failure to observe legal standards and the standards of the collective agreement concerning the dismissal procedure. The Committee firmly urges the Government to examine together with the trade unions the evictions affecting hundreds of former workers of PDVSA and its subsidiaries in the State of Falcn and in the San Tom and Anaco oilfields with a view to finding a solution to the problem and to keep it informed in this respect.(f) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the supposed offers of dialogue in the petroleum sector to which the document refers, as well as on the corresponding evidence.(g) Regarding the alleged anti-union reprisal in the form of PDVSA s written request to its subsidiaries and a Cypriot company not to hire the dismissed workers, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to these allegations. The Committee requests the Government to institute an independent investigation into this matter without delay and, if the allegations are found to be true, ensure that the workers affected are paid appropriate compensation.(h) As regards the detention orders of  February  issued against the UNAPETROL president and labour management secretary, Mr. Horacio Medina and Mr. Edgar Quijano, respectively, at the request of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic of Venezuela, by a penal court for presumed acts of sabotage and damage to installations belonging to the PDVSA enterprise (alleged discontinuation of electricity or gas supplies), as well as presumed political offences, and as regards similar actions taken with respect to other UNAPETROL members (Juan Fernandez, Lino Carrillo, Mireya Ripanti de Amaya, Gonzalo Feijoo and Juan Luis Santana, former company directors), the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied specifically to these allegations and urges it to send its observations in this respect as a matter of urgency.(i) With respect to the alleged systematic harassment of oil workers by the PDVSA loss prevention and control management and by a new pro-government workers' organization called the Association of Oil Workers (ASOPETROLEROS) (verbal and written threats via e-mail and Intranet; transfers of trained staff for political reasons; persecutions and espionage; arbitrary decisions concerning the structure and functioning of PDVSA and its subsidiaries having a direct effect on the workers), the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to these allegations and urges it to do so fully and without delay.Allegations by FEDEUNEP(j) As regards the alleged obstruction by the labour inspectorate of the draft fourth collective agreement submitted by FEDEUNEP, imposing demands that go beyond the law or are impossible to fulfil in practice within the prescribed deadline and subsequently rejecting the draft, as well as acceptance of a new draft (which was converted into a collective agreement) originating from six of the  FEDEUNEP leaders who formed a federation (FENTRASEP) approved by the government authorities and the Ministry of Labour, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to these allegations and urges it to send its observations fully and without delay.(k) As regards the alleged initiation of disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Gustavo Silva, SINTRAFORP general secretary, and Ms. Cecilia Palma, president of the FEDEUNEP disciplinary tribunal, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to these allegations and urges it to do so without delay.(l) Finally, the Committee would underline that it remains seriously concerned about the situation of workers' and employers' organizations in Venezuela and urges the Government to implement all its recommendations without delay.
.In its communication of  February , the National Union of Oil, Gas, Petrochemical and Refinery Workers (UNAPETROL), supported by the CTV, alleged that the President of the Republic, Hugo Chvez Fras, in his message to the nation on  January  to mark the fifth year of his Government, made statements amounting to an admission of the extremely serious fact of having intentionally and treacherously provoked the crisis in the national oil industry and the consequences which he, together with his collaborators and perpetrators, had designed in order to implement the threat that he himself had made in his radio and television programme ""Al, Presidente"" of  April , when, with a referee s whistle between his lips, he announced the dismissal of Eddie Ramirez, Juan Fernandez, Horacio Medina, Gonzalo Feijoo, Edgar Quijano, Alfredo Gomez and Carmen Elisa Hernandez. In addition to this, he also ""swore"" to dismiss all the workers if necessary. Such behaviour amounts to serious misconduct on the part of the employer or his representatives, which is why the complainant organization went before the employment stability tribunals to seek the restoration of the workers' labour rights in the form of the return to work of all those unjustifiably dismissed.
.The complainant organization adds that the workers of INTEVEP, S.A., a subsidiary of the Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) company, were unjustifiably dismissed en masse. This particular occurrence comes within the framework of dismissals previously reported. According to the complainant organization, on  February , seven workers acting on their own behalf and in their capacity as workers having been dismissed from the INTEVEP S.A. trading company, located on the Santa Rosa estate, El Tambor sector, Los Teques, State of Miranda, presented to the labour inspectorate of the municipality of Guaicaipuro, State of Miranda, pursuant to the provisions of articles  et seq. of the regulations of Venezuela s Organic Labour Act, a request for the opening of proceedings to suspend the mass dismissals, since INTEVEP had given notice of dismissal to  employees effective  January , amounting to a mass dismissal since on one single day and in one single act it dismissed over  per cent of its paid workforce (article  of Venezuela s Organic Labour Act), which, at  January , amounted to some , workers.
.On  February , the labour inspector of the municipality of Guaicaipuro, State of Miranda, accepted the request without comment",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
222,"and notified the representation of the INTEVEP company, in accordance with the provisions of article  of the regulations of the Organic Labour Act. At the request of the employer, the inspector issued a decision agreeing to open the probatory period of eight working days provided for in article  of the regulations of the Organic Labour Act. On  March , the illegally dismissed workers confirmed the accusation of mass dismissal, and INTEVEP informed the labour inspector of a further decision on its part to notify the dismissal, on  March , of  workers, in addition to the  already dismissed, thereby increasing the number of dismissals with respect to the company s paid workforce. The complainant organization states that on  May  the labour inspector produced his report on the allegation of mass dismissal by the company INTEVEP S.A., asserting there to be no substance on which to make a pronouncement and no grounds for giving effect to the provisions of article  of the Organic Labour Act. The complainant points out that the dismissed workers were denied access to the case file.
.On  July , the dismissed workers lodged with the Ministry of Labour a hierarchical appeal against the report by the labour inspector of the municipality of Guaicaipuro, State of Miranda. The irregularities referred to included: () violation of the right of defence and of due process, as provided for in article  of the national Constitution; () violation of the right of defence, of due process and of petition, as provided for in articles  and  of the national Constitution and articles  and  of the Organic Act on Administrative Procedures, inasmuch as in his report corresponding to the culmination of the administrative procedure the labour inspector states that ""... the quantitative requirement laid down in the legislation has not been met ..."" since ""... it is clear to anyone examining the current procedure that the only formal complainants regarding the alleged mass dismissal are the seven petitioners previously identified, there being no documentary evidence of any wish on the part of the remaining  workers to lodge the said complaint ...""; in other words, the official considers it necessary to have an application on the part of all of the dismissed workers in order to request the opening of a procedure to suspend a mass dismissal, despite there being no such provision in the legislation; () incorrect appreciation of the law, the labour inspector having produced a number of inconsistencies and errors of interpretation of the labour legislation in force when he issued an administrative decision based on the content of a provision that does not apply to the case in question, namely article  of the Organic Labour Act, when he should have applied article  of the regulations of that same Act; () misuse and abuse of power, the labour inspector having distorted the understanding of labour regulations invoked as a legal foundation or basis. Finally, the complainant organization states that the Minister of Labour and other administrative officials directly involved with the field of labour repeatedly, publicly, in a discriminatory and biased manner and through the imposition of formalities not provided for in the legislation, repeatedly adopted, for the sole purpose of unduly delaying the administration of justice, a biased and condemnatory stance vis--vis the workers who had been dismissed from the national oil industry. The impartiality that is due from the Ministry of Labour with respect to the reported mass dismissal is seriously compromised inasmuch as the author of the mass dismissals is the Government of Venezuela, and inasmuch as the government body responsible under the law for defending the rights of workers, namely the Ministry of Labour, is acting in accordance with directives issued by the National Executive and has, through its highest representative, expressed an opinion with respect to the dismissed oil workers. The Minister of Labour, by resolution No. , rejected the appeal that had been lodged, stating there to be no socially beneficial grounds in favour of suspending the mass dismissal of the workers of the INTEVEP company, a subsidiary of PDVSA. On the contrary, the shut-down of the oil, gas and petrochemical industry by its workers, including those of INTEVEP, disrupted the quality of life in all areas of Venezuelan society.
.As regards the violation of the trade union immunity of Mr. Diesbalo Osbardo Espinoza Ortega, general secretary of the Union of Workers, Oil Employees and Associated of Carabobo State (SOEPC), the complainant organization states that, following the initiation of the procedure provided for in articles  et seq. of the Organic Labour Act for the ""examination of the grounds of the dismissal"" of the leaders of that trade union, including Mr. Diesbalo Osbardo Espinoza Ramrez, general secretary of the union, the owner of the company PDVSA Petrleo S.A. requested the labour inspector to order the precautionary measure of barring the union leaders from having access to the company premises, on the grounds that those union leaders had allegedly generated a strike in December . That measure was agreed to, in addition to which the owner suspended the payment of salaries to the union leaders.
.As regards the persecution of UNAPETROL leaders, warrants for the arrest of whom had been issued, the complainant organization states that on  June , by a decision of the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court of Justice, all of the litigation in the criminal proceedings under way was cancelled. Nevertheless, the process of persecution of the aforementioned union leaders and oil workers was reinitiated by the Office of the Attorney-General, with new writs being served on  and  March .
.The complainant organization goes on to describe the current situation with regard to the unjustified dismissals of workers from Petrleos de Venezuela. It states that, out of a total of some , workers, , were dismissed as from  December . This was accompanied by , unjustified dismissals from the INTESA company, in which PDVSA had a shareholding of  per cent and SAIC of  per cent, the workers in question having been engaged in the process of incorporation into the PDVSA workforce prior to the national civic work stoppage of  December .
.The complainant affirms that UNAPETROL was established as a national trade union in an assembly of workers on  June , with a total of  founder members, only  founders being necessary under the labour legislation in force, and with no requirements over and above those indicated in the legislation, no administrative body, in this case the Ministry of Labour, having any powers to prevent its registration beyond those provided for under the legislation to permit the registration of any trade union organization, which of course may not contravene constitutional provisions or the provisions of ILO Conventions Nos.  and  on freedom of association and the right to organize, both of which have been ratified by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The staff members who, under the statutes, may become members of UNAPETROL are those at the senior and middle management levels, these being terms defined internally by the PDVSA and which are not defined in the labour legislation in force in Venezuela. Over  per cent of these staff members do not perform managerial functions. The so-called senior and middle management find in UNAPETROL the body which represents and defends them in the absence of any representative organization for these workers, and these workers have working conditions that are specified in their individual contracts of employment and PDVSA s internal regulations. Only those workers belonging to the so-called lower levels of the workforce have, since , had representative trade unions, which negotiate collective agreements with PDVSA. All these workers, apart from those indicated as being on the board of directors of PDVSA and a small number of others who, under the labour legislation, are characterized as human resources managers, have the constitutional right to establish free trade unions, as provided for in article  of the national Constitution adopted on  December .
.In its communication of  March , the Government refers to the allegations presented by the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) relating to the trade union s hostile treatment by the Government, using as an additional pretext CTV s participation in the ""national civic work stoppage"", the refusal to recognize its leaders, the promotion of a pro-government workers' confederation, and the use of state power to deprive the CTV president of his liberty (on  February , an order was issued for the detention of Carlos Ortega).
.The Government denies that it reserved hostile treatment to CTV or any trade union. The Government reaffirms, nonetheless, that it recognizes the institutional nature of the CTV, but has been provided with no factual or legal arguments for recognizing a so-called executive committee which has been challenged by other trade union sectors since the holding of the CTV elections in . The Government insists that it is not a question",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
223,"of interference on the part of the Venezuelan State, but that on the contrary the State, as represented by the President of the Republic, is extremely concerned and responds politically to those who, politically on behalf of the CTV, take actions that run counter to the actions of trade union and trade association leaders and systematically promote a strictly political agenda that violates the Constitution of the Republic and is thus anti-democratic. That is the hostile treatment of which the CTV is complaining.
.The Government adds that the CTV s intention is to discredit the Head of State. Indeed, the self-styled members of CTV s executive committee have turned aside from the fundamental objective of any workers' organization and have devoted themselves solely to political proselytism, systematically accusing the President of the Republic of being a dictator, it being clear from the subversive practices of the self-styled members of the CTV executive committee that their intention is to destabilize the State institutions, impose a dictatorship and take power by force, just as they did together with the employers' organization FEDECAMARAS for a short period on  and  April . The Government underlines that one of the principal architects of the country s political, economic and social destabilization is Mr. Carlos Ortega, who claims to be the president of the CTV. Indeed, Mr. Pedro Carmona Estanga, the self-proclaimed President of the Republic and the then (April ) president of the employers' organization FEDECAMARAS, said, in statements made to a local newspaper one year after mounting the coup d at, that the self-styled president of the CTV, Mr. Carlos Ortega, had endorsed a part of the de facto cabinet at the time.
.According to the Government, a few months after Mr. Carlos Ortega and other self-styled leaders of the CTV executive committee had proclaimed themselves members of that committee, with the systematic backing of private operators, owners of communication media and opposition parties involved in the conspiracy against a Government that had been legally established by popular vote, the self-styled CTV executive committee began to foster an attitude of ongoing conspiracy against Venezuelan democracy and its legitimately established authorities. Mr. Ortega dedicated himself systematically and solely, together with the other self-styled members of the CTV executive committee, to a succession of subversive actions, fostering hatred, intolerance and the sabotaging of the Venezuelan economy with clear political intentions having nothing to do with the Constitution, law or democracy, even though paradoxically he ""spoke"" in the name of democracy, until ultimately Mr. Ortega took part in the planning and implementation of the so-called ""civic work stoppage"" of  October and subsequently the whole of December  and January , aided and abetted by, and in association with, the representation of FEDECAMARAS. There can be no denying the lack of respect and climate of aggression that has been fostered by the self-styled representation of the CTV, together with the employers' organization FEDECAMARAS, whose former president signed, on  April , the deed of constitution of the transitional Government, thereby seeking to justify the coup d at that had been mounted by a minority portion of civil society.
.The Government once again insists on its position of non-interference vis--vis the institution CTV and those who claim to be its representatives, who have still not been capable of demonstrating in a transparent, legal and convincing manner that they have been legitimately elected; nor have they ever presented the corresponding communication, certified and signed by CTV s electoral board, following the holding of an election by those affiliated to the confederation, as was the commitment at the request of the CTV s union management board, that commitment having been secured with the authorities of the National Electoral Council prior to the confederation s elections in October .
.As regards the alleged promotion of the establishment of a workers' confederation supportive of its party, the Government points out that the free establishment of a trade union, federation or confederation is perfectly normal on Venezuelan territory, just as it is strictly right and proper for the national Government not to interfere administratively in workers' affairs. In actual fact, it is the affiliated workers themselves who are settling and resolving their differences. Indeed, if the members of the CTV establish a new trade union which brings them together in the form of a confederation and which complies with the requirements laid down under the law and the ILO Conventions, the Government is bound to register it.
.As regards the allegation that the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is using the full weight of the State s power to deprive the president of the Confederation of his liberty, giving effect to his intention by having had issued, on  February , a detention order against Carlos Ortega, the Government states that the judicial procedure was carried out by the competent authorities of the judiciary, and that the National Executive acted solely as a subsidiary body to the courts and through the Intelligence and Prevention Services Directorate, attached to the Justice and Interior Ministry. ILO Convention No.  requires trade union leaders to abide by the law. The Constitution specifies the manner in which the country s public authorities are divided, assigning to each branch the corresponding competencies and powers. The judicial detention order issued by the relevant court against Mr. Carlos Ortega has absolutely nothing to do with any interference on the part of the national Government. Nor was it the consequence of the exercise of trade union activities, which means that the State s action was in accordance with the law, since the holder(s) of trade union office do not, by virtue of their position, have the right to transgress legal provisions in force, all the more so where those provisions have to do with the rights of persons, essentially the most vulnerable, who have been the most affected by incidents led by individuals who systematically deprived our population of essential public services, which they interrupted without any legality whatsoever, thereby putting in danger the lives, health and safety of the citizens.
.The Government recalls that where ignorance of the law on the part of employers' or workers' trade associations is concerned, the Committee on Freedom of Association has clearly stated its opinion that ""political matters which do not impair the exercise of freedom of association are outside the competence of the Committee. The Committee is not competent to deal with a complaint that is based on subversive acts, and it is likewise incompetent to deal with political matters that may be referred to in a government s reply"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, para. ], and that ""In the interests of the normal development of the trade union movement, it would be desirable to have regard to the principles enunciated in the resolution on the independence of the trade union movement adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session () that the fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement is the economic and social advancement of the workers and that when trade unions, in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members, decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of the trade union movement or its social or economic functions, irrespective of political changes in the country.""
.The Committee has likewise stated that ""Trade union organizations should not over-indulge in political activities and go beyond their true functions by promoting essentially political interests"" [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. ""It is only in so far as trade union organizations do not allow their occupational demands to assume a clearly political aspect that they can legitimately claim that there should be no interference in their activities. On the other hand, it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between what is political and what is, properly speaking, trade union in character. These two notions overlap and it is inevitable, and sometimes usual, for trade union publications to take a stand on questions having political aspects as well as on strictly economic and social questions"" [see Digest, op. cit., , para. ].
.The Government once again underlines the political, subversive and illegal character assumed by the self-styled executive committee of the CTV and of the person claiming to be its president, Mr. Carlos Ortega, as well as by the former president of the employers' organization FEDECAMARAS. These persons are seeking to conceal their strictly subversive and political activities, alleging that their ""status as trade unionists"" as established in ILO Convention No.  is being violated or disregarded. The Government urges the honourable Committee on Freedom of Association not to fall into this trap, since Mr. Ortega did not act in pursuit of the ""promotion and defence of the economic and",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
224,"social interests of the workers"".
.The complaint lodged with the Committee on Freedom of Association provides particularly clear proof of a union of sectors that are historically different, the self-styled representatives of the workers (CTV) and of the employers (FEDECAMARAS) having clearly joined forces, just as they did in order to conspire and systematically disown the constitutional State as from the latter part of , with the anti-democratic participation, moreover, of former executives and other officials who held senior positions in the state company Petrleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), high-, middle- and low-ranking military personnel, totally outside the Constitution, and leaders of political parties from the opposition grouped together in the so-called ""democratic coordination"", who, claiming to be acting in support of the people and with the undue utilization and complicity of communication media belonging to private radio, television, electronic and press enterprises, issued military communiqus to the population and directly urged the inhabitants of the Republic to disown the democratic and legitimate Government chosen by the Venezuelan people.
.The Government illustrates the authoritarian, political and anti-democratic involvement of Mr. Carlos Ortega with newspaper articles that demonstrate the illegal activities fostered by him and which had nothing whatsoever to do with any kind of struggle relating to claims of a union, labour, economic or social nature but resulted in legal proceedings under Venezuelan law, in full respect for the human rights of both of those charged, those legal proceedings having been initiated in accordance with the regulations in force in our country by the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic and the respective courts for the following offences: treason, conspiracy, incitement to crime, civil rebellion and criminal damage.
.Mr. Ortega never placed himself at the disposal of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic or of Control Court , becoming instead a fugitive from Venezuelan justice. Later, on  March , Mr. Ortega took refuge in the Republic of Costa Rica.
.The Government states that the so-called ""civic work stoppage"" and the sabotage promoted by the conspirators Carlos Ortega and Carlos Fernndez destroyed , jobs (unemployment rose by  percentage points). Also significant is the economy s recovery in terms of the generation of jobs, there having been a fundamental recovery in this regard in the second half of , with the jobs lost on account of the economic sabotage and so-called ""civic work stoppage"" fostered and led by Mr. Carlos Ortega in the name of the CTV, democracy and human rights, having been recovered. The ""civic work stoppage"" led, moreover, to a sharp rise in inflation owing to the paralysis of the main industry and the lack of foreign currency earnings, not to mention the capital outflow, cost speculation and the distribution chain. Even more crushing was the way in which the so-called ""civic work stoppage"" almost devastated the Venezuelan economy through the drop in GDP, something in which Mr. Carlos Ortega and Mr. Carlos Fernndez, as president of FEDECAMARAS and on behalf of that employers' institution, played a direct part. Following the devastating drop in the level of GDP in the first three-quarters of the year, it began once again to rise in the last quarter, and this, together with the recovery of the oil industry and other factors, served to restore investor confidence.
.The Government states that in a communication it was able to intercept between Mr. Ortega and the current president of the CTV, Mr. Ortega made anti-democratic statements in which he spoke of the setting up of a dictatorship. Recently, in a fresh conspiracy against the Government, Mr. Carlos Ortega, on  February , made a number of public statements from Costa Rica in which he falsely and recklessly claimed that ""President Hugo Chvez ... is preparing to launch a self-coup (autogolpe) sometime this week"", the context for this supposed self-coup d at being the non-acceptance of a decision by Venezuela s electoral branch regarding a possible referendum on revoking the mandate of the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, an action permitted under the Constitution of the Republic and which is being implemented and supervised by the National Electoral Council, with a large number of observers from the Organization of American States (OAS), the Carter Center, as well as observers from the parties concerned. The views expressed by Mr. Ortega, referred to in the previous paragraph, prompted a written warning from the authorities of the Republic of Costa Rica.
.As regards the allegations made by FEDEUNEP, the Government states in its communication of  March  that, on  September , the National Single Federation of Public Employees (FEDEUNEP) presented to the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Public Sector) a draft collective agreement entitled ""draft fourth collective labour agreement for public administration employees"". On  September , the National Labour Inspector requested FEDEUNEP to make corrections that were necessary for reasons of legality pursuant to the provisions of article  of the Organic Labour Act in force, giving it a period of  days to make the required corrections in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Organic Act on Administrative Procedures, all of which was notified to it on  September . The official acted in accordance with the law and in the exercise of his duties and competencies, there having thus been no violation of freedom of association.
.The Government adds that, on  October , FEDEUNEP sent a communication to the National Labour Inspector stating that it was not going to comply with the request and that it did not recognize the competence of the National Labour Inspector. On  October , the National Labour Inspector stated that he is indeed the competent official, that the stated requirements had to be complied with since they had to do with public order, and that the labour administration is obliged to monitor the observance of legal provisions not complied with by the Federation, declaring the procedure to be terminated. This decision can be appealed against through administrative channels. The case file contains no mention of any appeal being lodged against this decision, and the decision, considered thus to have been accepted by FEDEUNEP, therefore stands. It is clear from the foregoing that the termination of the said procedure and its legal consequences can be attributed to the lack of due diligence on the part of those who initiated it, in consequence of which the actions of the labour administration does not constitute disregard of union rights, interference or abuse of authority.
.Subsequently, on  October , the labour inspector received another draft collective agreement, entitled ""fourth framework collective agreement for public administration employees, pensioners and retirees"", presented by a number of citizens stating themselves to be FEDEUNEP executives. On the same date, it was recorded in the minutes that the supporting documents were received without any decision being taken, and the minutes were signed both by those claiming to be representatives of FEDEUNEP and by the leaders of the first-level trade unions supporting the agreement, whether or not affiliated to the Federation. On  November , further signatures were received in support of the request by FEDEUNEP. On  December , negotiations began on the draft collective agreement, not only with those claiming to belong to the Federation but also with the representatives of the first-level trade unions.
.On  March , the First Administrative Court notified the labour inspector that another group of citizens claiming to represent FEDEUNEP had lodged an appeal for the declaration of nullity of an administrative action together with a claim for the enforcement of their constitutional rights (amparo constitucional). On  April , the Court made a precautionary ruling allowing the appeal, declaring the precautionary amparo to be in order and, additionally, ordering the suspension of the administrative proceedings being pursued by the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Public Sector) of the Ministry of Labour in relation to the draft ""fourth framework collective agreement for public administration employees, pensioners and retirees"" presented on  October ; it also required the office to refer the case in the framework of the ongoing administrative annulment proceedings, thereby surmising as to a latent intra-union problem regarding which the labour administration is not competent.
.In view of the precautionary ruling issued by the First Administrative Court, on  May , collective bargaining having previously been suspended by that court order, the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Public Sector) of the Ministry of Labour presented a written objection to the effect that the ruling contained a large number of inconsistencies and fundamental errors which invalidated it and, in particular, stated that a dispute relating to trade union elections or a conflict within a given union could not be resolved by the administrative authority, that the ruling could not be made on the basis of the evidence contained in the case file, and that evidence could not be based on an opinion expressed by the labour inspector. The precautionary ruling should have been limited to determining the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
225,"status of the persons in question and should not have brought the collective bargaining to a halt, especially when it involved not only the Federation but also the first-level trade unions, these being the direct and immediate beneficiaries of the right to voluntary collective bargaining. He advanced the view that the acceptance of the draft collective agreement that had been in process did not in any way imply the recognition of the representatives involved; that by  October  nothing was known of the legitimacy or otherwise of the citizens claiming to be FEDEUNEP executives, inasmuch as the supporting documentation relating to personal status with which they were acting was never presented either by the requesting party or by the employer in accordance with the law, there being no mandatory requirement that the administration should inquire as to that situation; that the draft was not presented solely by the alleged representatives of FEDEUNEP but, on the contrary, by a number of trade unions not affiliated to it; and that for this reason the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Public Sector) of the Ministry of Labour was not in a position to refuse to process the draft presented. Finally, it was requested that the precautionary ruling be revoked on the grounds that it was the status of the FEDEUNEP representatives that was under discussion and not that of the first-level unions, and that it amounted to judicial interference in the freedom of association of the aforementioned Federation. He points out that a number of citizens objected to the precautionary measure on a third-party basis, affirming that the reported violations cannot be imputed to the director in question inasmuch as the lack of representativity or status of the trade union constitute, in the course of the negotiations, elements that the employer can use to his favour which cannot be opposed by the labour entity; and that matters were weighed up incorrectly inasmuch as an outrage was committed against the collective interests of more than , public sector workers who were prevented from engaging in collective bargaining for the purpose of improving their working conditions.
.The First Administrative Court decided, by a ruling made on  August , to declare the discontinuation of the appeal for declaration of nullity together with the precautionary decision to suspend the effect of the administrative proceedings instituted by the representatives of FEDEUNEP, considering the provisions of article  of the Organic Act of the Supreme Court of Justice to be applicable on account of the loss of interest on the part of the Federation and the consequent acceptance of all the actions of the labour administration. In other words, the inactivity and lack of diligence on the part of the complainants had resulted in the filing of the case, in consequence of which the conduct was deemed appropriate.
.On  May , the National Executive Coordination of the National Federation of Public Sector Workers (FENTRASEP) put before the Ministry of Labour a draft collective agreement for public administration employees, pensioners and retirees; it did so with the support of those first-level unions that were disaffiliated from FEDEUNEP, this having been placed on record when the draft was introduced, it being noted that no remarks of a legal nature were made concerning the draft. During the discussions, other unions expressed their support, both for the collective agreement and for FENTRASEP.
.On  June , other persons stating themselves to be FEDEUNEP leaders - the same persons who lodged the appeal without awaiting the ruling of the First Administrative Court - once again presented a draft collective agreement for discussion, that draft being received by the labour administration despite its having previously accepted a draft collective agreement presented by FENTRASEP. On  June , pursuant to the provisions of article  of the Organic Labour Act, the presumed executive committee of FEDEUNEP was requested to make corrections that were necessary for reasons of legality, being given a period of  days to make the required corrections in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Organic Act on Administrative Procedures. FEDEUNEP refused to comply with that request, stating that the national inspector lacked jurisdiction. On  July , the national inspector issued an administrative ruling declaring the conclusion of the procedure. The case file contains no record of any administrative appeal or administrative challenge against that ruling, which was thus accepted.
.On  August , once the discussions and voluntary negotiations had been completed between the public administration, the National Federation of Public Sector Workers (FENTRASEP) and the first-level unions disaffiliated from FEDEUNEP, and other unions having duly expressed their support both for the collective agreement and for FENTRASEP, the collective agreement for national public administration employees and officials, which benefits over , workers, was signed.
.As regards the complaint lodged by FEDEUNEP regarding the dismissal of Cecilia Palma from the nominal post she occupied at the National Nutrition Institute (INN), the Government points out that the corresponding disciplinary proceedings were pursued against the aforementioned citizen, leading to a sufficiently well-substantiated administrative ruling on  November  by which the aforementioned official was dismissed from her post of Attorney I, there having been sufficient grounds for such dismissal under article () of the Administrative Service Act. It should be noted that, in response to this, citizen Palma lodged an appeal for declaration of nullity of an administrative action, it being finally concluded by Higher Administrative Court No.  , on  September , that ""the attorney Cecilia de Lourdes Palma Maita displayed an extremely serious lack of integrity vis--vis the institution with which she was employed and her colleagues, entering into an irregular situation in which she took advantage of the situation the country was experiencing at the time, such behaviour on the part of the complainant being inexcusable. The judge notes that the misconduct with which the complainant was charged cannot be excused since her actions resulted in damages to the National Nutrition Institute"". As can be seen, the judge dismissed the appeal for annulment of the administrative ruling, thereby establishing that the actions of the employer institution constituted neither a political retaliation to the events of ,  and  April , nor a violation of the citizen s right to exercise her union activities, nor anti-union discrimination, but rather that a punishment was imposed in response to the fact that her actions fell within one of the scenarios which the internal regulations punish by means of the disciplinary action taken.
.The Committee notes the Government s observations. The Committee observes that the Government refers to events which occurred in April , i.e. on dates that are different from those of the allegations presented which do not form part of the present complaints. For this reason, the Committee will not refer to those events.
.As regards the allegations relating to the detention order served against Mr. Carlos Ortega, president of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), the Committee notes the Government s statements according to which: () the apparent trade union office of Mr. Ortega does not confer upon him an immunity that allows him to transgress the legal provisions in force; () Mr. Ortega has devoted himself, in addition to union activities, to conspiring through subversive activities including participation in the planning and implementation of the so-called ""civic work stoppage"" of  October, and in the one carried out in the months of December  and January , in complicity and association with the representation of FEDECAMARAS, inciting hatred, intolerance and sabotage with clear political intentions; () the detention order against Mr. Ortega was issued by the judiciary, fully independently, in accordance with the system of division of powers, and the Executive confined itself to complying with the judicial arrest warrant, which is not motivated by any anti-union considerations.
.The Committee observes, in respect of the civic work stoppages of October and December , and January , that the Government identifies the organization of, and participation in, those stoppages as subversive activities (in addition to having resulted in a  per cent increase in the level of unemployment and the devastation of the Venezuelan economy), and that, in short, it is on account of those activities that the arrest warrant was issued against Mr. Ortega, with the accusation of treason, incitement to crime and criminal damage. In this respect, the Committee recalls that in its previous examination of the case it had expressed the view that ""the national civic work stoppage convened by the CTV, inter alia, and comprising a set of labour claims, can be likened to a general strike, and therefore to a trade union activity and that the detention of leaders of workers' and employers' organizations for activities connected with the exercise of their right to organize is contrary to the principles of freedom of association"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee recalls that hundreds of thousands of persons participated in the",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
226,"civic work stoppages, and that although the principal objective of the stoppages was to secure the departure from office of the President of the Republic or the holding of a recall referendum, they did not result in any coup d at, what lay behind the demands having more to do with a clear protest against the Government s economic and social policy and its consequences, and against the failure to recognize the executive board of the CTV.
.As regards the warrant for the arrest of Mr. Ortega, the Committee regrets to observe that the Government has not replied in full to the allegations to the effect that the arrest warrant was issued within the framework of a procedure without guarantees of due process, by a judge who lacked impartiality. The Committee observes that according to the Government, the civic work stoppage was the scene of sabotage and acts of violence resulting in physical injuries to a number of people, with numerous violations of human rights.
.The Committee observes that although the Government considers Mr. Ortega and the president of FEDECAMARAS to have instigated a major part of the aforementioned offences, reference is made only to generic charges highlighting the very serious consequences of the civic work stoppages for the economy and level of employment, without any enumeration of the specific actions attributable to Mr. Ortega and which gave rise to the accusations. The Government has provided a chronological list of statements made by Mr. Ortega, in which verbal excesses are to be seen, but it cannot be deduced from those statements that there was any call for violence, nor can one justify the existence of a causal link between the statements made by Mr. Ortega and any offences committed during the civic work stoppages. The Committee emphasizes, moreover, that Mr. Ortega has taken refuge in another country. Finally, the Committee would underline that only Mr. Ortega, president of the CTV, which is the most representative trade union confederation in Venezuela, and the president of FEDECAMARAS were the subject of detention orders, despite the fact that other political sectors and parties took part in the civic work stoppage.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the purpose of the detention order against Mr. Ortega was to neutralize or take reprisals against this union leader for his activities in defence of workers' interests, and it therefore strongly urges the Government to take steps to vacate the detention order against Mr. Ortega and guarantee that he may return to the country so as to be able to perform the trade union functions corresponding to his post of president, without being subject to reprisals.
.With respect to the failure to recognize the executive committee of the CTV, including its president Mr. Ortega, the Committee notes the Government s statement to the effect that those who claim to be its representatives have thus far been unable to demonstrate in a transparent, legal and convincing manner that they have been legitimately elected, and have not presented the communication, certified and signed by CTV s own electoral board, following the holding of an election by those affiliated to this Confederation, as was the commitment with the authorities of the national electoral council prior to the Confederation s elections in October , at the request of the CTV s union management board; furthermore, that executive committee is being challenged by other union elements who participated in the CTV s electoral process. The Committee observes that this question was already examined in another case (see Case No. , th Report, para. ), repeats it previous observations and recommendations, and therefore once again urges the Government to recognize the executive committee of the CTV. The Committee recalls that the supervision of trade union elections should be carried out through judicial channels and that the various ILO supervisory bodies have pointed out that the national electoral council s intervention in the elections is not in conformity with Convention No. .
.As regards the promotion of the establishment of a workers' confederation supportive of the party of the President of the Republic and the hostile statements towards the CTV, the Committee notes the Government s statement to the effect that: () the free establishment of a trade union, federation or confederation is perfectly normal on Venezuelan territory, just as it is strictly right and proper for the Government not to interfere in workers' affairs; it is the affiliated workers themselves who are settling and resolving their differences, and if the members of the CTV establish a new trade union which brings them together in the form of a confederation and which complies with the requirements laid down under the law and the ILO Conventions, the Government is bound to register it; () as regards the Government s hostile statements in regard to the CTV and its leaders, the Government denies treating the CTV or any other trade union with hostility, pointing out, nevertheless, that it is extremely concerned at the internal situation of the CTV, political responsibility for which lies with those who, politically, on behalf of the CTV, engage in actions that run counter to the conduct and actions of trade union leaders and systematically promote a strictly political agenda that violates the Constitution of the Republic and is hence anti-democratic. The Committee recalls that ""on more than one occasion, it has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had, by their attitude, favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organizations: (i) pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities; (ii) refusal to recognize the leaders of certain organizations in the performance of their legitimate activities; discrimination by such methods, or by others, may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers; they are, therefore, sometimes difficult to prove. The fact, nevertheless, remains that any discrimination of this kind jeopardizes the right of workers set out in Convention No. , Article , to establish and join organizations of their own choosing"" [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee notes that the CTV and ICFTU have referred to specific hostile statements being directed at the CTV by the authorities and requests the Government to abstain from making statements in CTV s regard which could express hostility towards that trade union, as well as to abstain from promoting the establishment of other trade unions or confederations.
.As regards the alleged obstruction by the labour inspectorate of the draft fourth collective agreement submitted by FEDEUNEP, imposing demands that go beyond the law or are impossible to fulfil in practice within the prescribed deadline and subsequently rejecting the draft, as well as acceptance of a new draft (which was converted into a collective agreement) originating from six of the  FEDEUNEP leaders who formed a federation (FENTRASEP) approved by the government authorities and the Ministry of Labour, the Committee notes the Government s observations to the effect that the draft fourth collective agreement submitted on  September  by FEDEUNEP was observed by the labour inspectorate, pursuant to article  of the Organic Labour Act, not to be in compliance with the legal requirements (supplying of the FEDEUNEP statutes, correction of the record of the assembly of FEDEUNEP s national executive committee, supplying of an up-to-date list of the member unions or associations, supplying of an up-to-date list of the workers affiliated to each of the unions, presentation of the rank and file union membership s authorization for submitting the draft, among other things), the trade union having been given a period of  days within which to make the corrections, this having not been done by the union, which saw the labour inspectorate as lacking the competence to make the aforementioned observations. The Committee likewise notes that according to the Government, a number of FEDEUNEP officials subsequently submitted a new draft collective agreement which led to the commencement of negotiations on  December , but was contested by another sector of the Federation through an appeal for annulment submitted to the First Administrative Court, that appeal being ultimately declared withdrawn. Finally, the Committee notes that on  May , the national executive coordination of the National Federation of Public Sector Workers (FENTRASEP), supported by a group of first-level unions disaffiliated from FEDEUNEP, submitted a new draft collective agreement which drew no observations of a legal nature from the labour inspectorate. On  August , the collective agreement was signed despite the fact that once again a sector of FEDEUNEP submitted a new draft which gave rise to new observations by the inspectorate. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on whether FEDEUNEP has lodged any judicial appeal against the collective agreement concluded between the public administration and FENTRASEP.
.The Committee observes that the Government has not sent the observations and information requested regarding the other recommendations made in the context of the previous examination of the case and which are reproduced at the end. It therefore reiterates those recommendations while at the same time",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
227,"requesting the Government to send such observations and information without delay.
.The Committee requests the complainant organizations to send their comments on the Government s declarations concerning the dismissal of FEDEUNEP official Cecilia Palma.
.The Committee also observes that the Government has not sent its observations regarding the allegations presented by UNAPETROL on  February , relating to the mass dismissals at the PDVSA oil company and its subsidiaries, the violation of the trade union immunity of Mr. Diesbalo Osbardo Espinoza Ortega, general secretary of the Union of Workers, Oil Employees and Associated of the State of Carabobo (SOEPC), and the persecution of UNAPETROL officials in respect of whom arrest warrants had been issued, and requests it to do so without delay. The Committee also requests the Government to send without delay its observations with regard to the additional information sent by UNAPETROL with the support of CTV in a communication dated  April .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With respect to the warrant for the arrest of Mr. Ortega, the Committee strongly urges the Government to take steps to vacate the detention order against Mr. Ortega and to guarantee that he may return to the country so as to be able to perform the trade union functions corresponding to his post of president, without being subject to reprisals.(b) With respect to the failure to recognize the executive committee of the CTV, including its president, Mr. Ortega, the Committee observes that this question was already examined in another case [see Case No. , th Report, para. ], repeats its previous observations and recommendations formulated within the framework of Case No. , and therefore once again urges the Government to recognize the executive committee of the CTV.(c) With respect to the promotion of the establishment of a workers' confederation supportive of the party of the President of the Republic and the hostile statements towards the CTV, the Committee requests the Government to abstain from making statements in the CTV s regard which could express hostility towards that trade union, as well as to abstain from promoting the establishment of other trade unions or confederations.(d) As regards the alleged obstruction by the labour inspectorate of the draft fourth collective agreement submitted by FEDEUNEP, imposing demands that go beyond the law or are impossible to fulfil in practice within the prescribed deadline and subsequently rejecting the draft, as well as acceptance of a new draft (which was converted into a collective agreement) originating from six of the  FEDEUNEP leaders who formed a federation (FENTRASEP) approved by the government authorities and the Ministry of Labour, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on whether FEDEUNEP has lodged any judicial appeal against the collective agreement concluded between the public administration and FENTRASEP.(e) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent the observations and information requested regarding the other recommendations made in the context of the previous examination of the case and therefore reiterates those recommendations and requests the Government to send its observations and information without delay. These recommendations relate to the following issues:- information on whether other workers were injured in the march that took place on  May , as asserted by the ICFTU, and if so, what legal action was taken;- the alleged acts of violence by the military on  January  against a group of workers from the Panamco de Venezuela S.A. enterprise, leaders of the Beverage Industry Union of the State of Carabobo; the need to institute an independent investigation without delay into the instances of detention and torture claimed by the CTV to have been suffered by workers Faustino Villamediana, Jorge Gregorio Flores Gallardo, Jhonathan Magdaleno Rivas, Juan Carlos Zavala and Ramn Daz;- the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register UNAPETROL and the Ministry s request to the state enterprise PDVSA to describe the duties performed by the promoters of UNAPETROL;- the dismissal of more than , workers from PDVSA and its subsidiaries, including the members of UNAPETROL, since the start of the ""national civic work stoppage"" in December ; the result of the legal action taken by the dismissed workers and negotiations with the most representative trade union confederations in order to find a solution; the observations on the alleged failure to observe legal standards and the standards of the collective agreement concerning the dismissal procedure; the examination, together with the trade unions, of the evictions affecting hundreds of former workers of PDVSA and its subsidiaries in the State of Falcn and in the San Tom and Anaco oilfields with a view to finding a solution to the problem;- information on the supposed offers of dialogue in the petroleum sector to which the Government referred, as well as the corresponding evidence;- the alleged anti-union reprisal in the form of PDVSA s written request to its subsidiaries and a Cypriot company not to hire the dismissed workers, the need to institute an independent investigation into this matter without delay and, if the allegations are found to be true, ensure that the workers affected are paid appropriate compensation;- the detention orders of  February  issued against the UNAPETROL president and labour management secretary, Mr. Horacio Medina and Mr. Edgar Quijano, respectively, and as regards similar actions taken with respect to other UNAPETROL members (Juan Fernandez, Lino Carrillo, Mireya Ripanti de Amaya, Gonzalo Feijoo and Juan Luis Santana, former company directors);- the alleged systematic harassment of oil workers by the PDVSA loss prevention and control management and by a new pro-government workers' organization called the Association of Oil Workers (ASOPETROLEROS);- allegations presented by UNAPETROL on  February  relating to the mass dismissals at the PDVSA oil company and its subsidiaries, the violation of the trade union immunity of Mr Diesbalo Osbardo Espinoza Ortega, general secretary of the Union of Workers, Oil Employees and Associated of the State of Carabobo (SOEPC), and the persecution of UNAPETROL officials in respect of whom arrest warrants had been issued;- the alleged initiation of disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Gustavo Silva, SINTRAFORP general secretary.(f) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to send their comments on the Government s declarations concerning the dismissal of FEDEUNEP official Cecilia Palma.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send without delay its observations concerning the additional information sent by UNAPETROL with the support of CTV in a communication dated  April .(h) The Committee would underline that it remains seriously concerned about the situation of workers' and employers' organizations in Venezuela and once again urges the Government to implement all its recommendations without delay.(i) The Committee will examine the communication dated  May , received while it was meeting, and which refers to the assassination of the trade unionist Mr. Numar Ricardo Herrera when it next examines the case.
.The first complaint is contained in a communication dated  February  from the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), which sent additional information in a communication dated  February . In a communication dated  February  the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) supported the complaint from the CTV, and in a communication dated  May  it sent new allegations. In a communication dated  March , the National Union of Oil, Gas, Petrochemical and Refinery Workers (UNAPETROL) submitted another complaint, and sent new allegations in communications dated  May,  August,  September and  November . In a communication dated  April , received on  June , the National Single Federation of Public Employees (FEDEUNEP) submitted a new complaint and supplied additional information in a communication dated  October .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October  and  March , the latter being received one day before the meeting of the Committee.
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  February , the CTV, supported by the ICFTU in a communication dated  February , alleges that the President of the Republic: refused to recognize the CTV leadership; was promoting the establishment of a workers' confederation supportive of his party using all the power of the State; and, in a public address on  February  attacked the CTV saying that,  the CTV must disappear from the Venezuelan scene and a workers' movement ' a Venezuelan labour confederation must be born because these gangsters  ?[referring to its leadership]  should be imprisoned as saboteurs, fascists, irresponsible people and delinquents'  The reason for these statements was the CTV s participation in the  national civic work stoppage' since  December .
.The CTV and the ICFTU allege that on  February  a detention order was issued against the president of the CTV, Mr. Carlos Ortega, who was persecuted continuously for days by state security guards with the aim of imprisoning him. The detention order was based on the presumed",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
228,"perpetration (during the  national civic work stoppage'  of political offences (treason, incitement to crime, criminal damage) and was issued without the guarantees of due process being upheld, by a judge who patently identified with the Government and therefore lacked impartiality.
.In its communication of  February , the CTV alleges that, during the  national civic work stoppage' which had been taking place in Venezuela since  December  and is still going on in the national oil industry. On  January , in the city of Valencia in the State of Carabobo, the National Guard General Luis Felipe Acosta Carles raided the premises of Panamco de Venezuela S.A., an enterprise engaged in the production and distribution of Coca-Cola beverages. The purpose of the military action was to confiscate the beverages stored on the premises, whose owners were allegedly hoarding essential goods. The military personnel who carried out the operation acted violently, resulting in serious injury not only to groups of civilians outside the plant but also to a group of workers who were officials of the Beverage Industry Union of the State of Carabobo, an organization affiliated to the Federation of Beverage Industry Workers, which in turn is affiliated to the CTV. The victims of the attack were in and around the company premises because they had been collecting outstanding benefit payments. The cause of the scuffles was their protest at the arbitrary conduct of the National Guard and because the confiscation of the goods represented a threat to their jobs. Faustino Villamediana, Jos Gregorio Flores Gallardo, Jhonathan Magdaleno Rivas, Juan Carlos Zavala and Ramn Daz were detained illegally and tortured, being beaten with sticks and truncheons, in flagrant violation of their human rights.
.In its communication of  May , the ICFTU reported the murder of Mr. Numar Ricardo Herrera, a member of the Federation of Construction Workers, on  May  during a peaceful trade union march in Caracas, when unidentified persons fired on the participants. Other workers were also injured.
.In its communications of  March,  May,  August,  September and  November , UNAPETROL alleges that despite sending the relevant documentation to the Ministry of Labour on  July , the aforementioned organization (established with the participation of  workers) has not been registered.
.On  July , the Ministry of Labour asked the State enterprise Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) for a description of the duties performed in the enterprise by the promoters of UNAPETROL; the enterprise claimed in August  that the Ministry should not grant registration, considering the trade union members as representatives of the employer and management.
.On  August , the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Matters of the Ministry of Labour, echoing the PDVSA statement, issued administrative Decree No. -, stating that registration of the UNAPETROL trade union was refused  on the grounds that, under article  of the regulations of the Organic Labour Act, a trade union which claims to represent the interests of both workers and employers, and is composed of workers who constitute the senior and middle management of the enterprise, may not be established' 
.UNAPETROL refers to various irregularities, describes the various proceedings and decisions of the authorities and states that they have given rise to delays and to the refusal to register the organization. In addition, since December , PDVSA has dismissed more than , workers, including workers affiliated to UNAPETROL, for supposed  lack of integrity' or  immoral conduct at work'  despite the fact that article  of the Organic Labour Act guarantees the irremovability of workers affiliated to a trade union which is being established. These mass dismissals were also unjustified and were undertaken without any prior assessment by the labour inspector, in breach of the legislation and collective agreement in force. The employer failed to inform the Ministry of Labour and request due authorization from the latter, which also took no action to ensure that the rule of law was applied and thus suspend the dismissals, and did not put forward reasons of social interest to prevent them.
.In this respect, article  of the Organic Labour Act states that the Ministry may, by means of a special decision, suspend mass dismissals for reasons of social interest. No such decision was issued by the Ministry, even though the limit for dismissals laid down in the aforementioned article had been exceeded, namely  per cent of the workforce for enterprises with more than  workers. Similarly, the labour inspectorates (under the authority of the Ministry) did not summon the employer in accordance with the procedure laid down in article  of the regulations of the Organic Labour Act. Furthermore, the employer did not meet the terms of article  since the dismissals were not due to a staff reduction plan in which economic circumstances had been cited, or to a progress or technological modification plan. Even more serious is the fact that the dismissals occurred at a time when the workers were exercising their right to organize with respect to the UNAPETROL union.
.In addition, clause  of the collective agreement protecting the workers states that the latter may only be dismissed on good grounds that have been previously proven by the judicial bodies; in such cases the agreement provides for social benefits such as seniority pay. At present the workers are not entitled to medical assistance or provisions of essential goods, nor do their children have the right to schooling. The clauses concerning the trade union conciliation procedure for resolving matters pertaining to the workers, as well as other clauses, have also been violated.
.Furthermore, PDVSA requested its subsidiaries in writing not to hire the dismissed workers and sent a similar letter to the Cypriot Hanseatic Shipping Company mentioning  workers. The dismissed workers ' who submitted administrative and judicial appeals ' have no access to their private saving funds and legal proceedings were initiated to evict the workers and their families from the housing to which they were entitled under the collective agreement in the residential zones of the areas in question. Thus hundreds of workers were evicted from their housing in the State of Falcn by judicial decision and  evictions took place in San Tom and Anaco oilfields in the State of Anzotegui. PDVSA requested the judiciary to declare null and void article  of the Organic Oil and Gas Act concerning the stability of workers and contractors, claiming that the country s workers are discriminated against with respect to those in the oil industry. This request to the judiciary was made after the mass dismissals (. per cent of the workforce).
.In addition, UNAPETROL alleges that, on  February , detention orders were issued against its president and labour management secretary, Horacio Medina and Edgar Quijano, respectively, at the request of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic of Venezuela, by a penal court for presumed acts of sabotage and damage to installations at the PDVSA enterprise (alleged discontinuation of electricity or gas supplies), as well as presumed political offences. These detention orders were issued without fulfilling the guarantees of due process, both by the representatives of the Attorney-General s Office and by the judge, who openly identify with the Government and thus lack impartiality. Similar actions were taken with respect to other UNAPETROL members (Juan Fernandez, Lino Carrillo, Mireya Ripanti de Amaya, Gonzalo Feijoo and Juan Luis Santana, former company directors).
.These acts of persecution against certain UNAPETROL members and other workers of PDVSA constitute the most recent chapter in the systematic harassment to which oil workers have been exposed in the last three to four years, especially by the loss prevention and control management of the enterprise, by a new pro?government workers' organization called the Association of Oil Workers (ASOPETROLEROS), and even by the PDVSA president. This harassment has consisted of verbal and written threats via e-mail and Intranet; transfers of trained staff for political reasons; persecutions and espionage; arbitrary decisions concerning the structure and functioning of PDVSA and its subsidiaries having a direct effect on the workers; and obstructing the establishment of UNAPETROL. Faced with these abuses, the appeals made received no reply. UNAPETROL points out that a statement from the authorities was also requested concerning the dismissal of thousands of workers for participating in actions to defend their labour rights and in particular as a consequence of the work stoppage that took place.
.In its communications of  April and  October , FEDEUNEP explained that in July  the National Electoral Council validated its electoral process and in August the Federation approved a draft fourth collective agreement and authorized the National Executive Committee to submit the draft to the Ministry of Labour for negotiation, and this was done on  September . Twenty-four hours after submission of the draft, a communication was received from the labour inspector containing a set of observations and demands, exceeding those which the inspector was legally entitled to make and also adopting a position corresponding to that of the employer,",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
229,"i.e. formulating exceptions and objections to the draft collective agreement, blatantly favouring the employer and demanding that procedures be completed and documents supplied within  days, many of them physically impossible to obtain within the deadline and not required by law. FEDEUNEP replied to the communication in question, supplied explanatory information and pointed out that the labour inspector was not competent to reject a draft collective agreement which complied with the formalities of the Organic Labour Act. However, again in less than  hours, without any direct notification, an administrative ruling was issued by the labour inspector stating that he considered the procedure to be concluded and rejecting the draft collective agreement. Meanwhile the President of the Republic was holding events throughout the country, calling them trade union meetings, even though the statements made were of an entirely party-political nature, accompanied by a small group of dissidents from the country s organized trade union movement, who were defeated in the electoral process; in the statements the President said that he would only recognize the aforementioned group, in open violation of ILO Conventions Nos.  and .
.The Ministry of Labour, for its part, in violation of the law, allowed and initiated immediate discussions concerning a draft collective agreement submitted with the illegal use of the FEDEUNEP name and logo by six union leaders (of a total of ), i.e. a minority group without rank or representativeness for such an action. In March , the Federation, exercising its legitimate right of defence, sought in the First Administrative Court a judicial decision warning the National Executive to rectify the breach in the law. When the Court issued an interim ruling in favour of FEDEUNEP, the latter submitted the draft fourth framework agreement approved in the general council of affiliated unions, and this was rejected by the Ministry of Labour in open violation of the Organic Labour Act and its regulations.
.The aforementioned six officials (now expelled) formed a federation (FENTRASEP) which was endorsed by the government authorities and the Ministry of Labour itself, which legalized it so that it could pursue, but under a different name, the discussions concerning the fourth framework agreement, which it had initiated illegally and as a means of circumventing the interim ruling of the Court.
.The Government signed the collective agreement with FENTRASEP, excluding local government employees and a series of clauses which had been in force since  when FEDEUNEP signed the third framework agreement. The same group of persons is seeking to sign collective agreements in local government offices, even though the legitimate trade unions and federations in those sectors were victorious in the  elections.
.Moreover, FEDEUNEP alleges that the trade union sector has suffered reprisals owing to the events of - April  in Venezuela, in particular the opening of disciplinary proceedings aimed at removing from office the leaders of unions affiliated to FEDEUNEP, including Mr. Gustavo Silva, general secretary of SINTRAFORP, and Dr. Cecilia Palma, president of the FEDEUNEP disciplinary tribunal (who, not coincidentally, chairs the disciplinary tribunal which is examining the expulsion of the dissident officials). Dr. Palma was dismissed on a false charge of insubordination, lack of integrity and slander while on full-time leave performing her union activities, i.e. Dr. Palma s resulting unavailability to the employer was deemed to be insubordination. The other charges are based on statements made by hostile employees representing the government authorities and therefore have no legal validity whatsoever. FEDEUNEP points out that, owing to the prevailing political climate in the country, a strike on account of the refusal to discuss a collective agreement would have resulted in the employees being threatened with dismissal, as well as running the risk of physical assault from violent groups if other protests had been made.
.In its communication of  October , the Government, in reply to the allegations made by the planned trade union UNAPETROL, states that certain groups of former workers (senior and middle managers) from PDVSA were responsible throughout  for a series of protests and illegal actions paralysing administrative sectors of strategic importance for the oil industry. Since then they have undertaken various protests and illegal stoppages, starting with allegations of irregularities regarding the legal and sovereign appointment (by the President of the Republic) of a new board of directors for PDVSA in February .
.It should be noted that the trade unions and workers organizations which comprise the contractual and daily workforce did not participate on a large scale in the abovementioned  civic work stoppage' which caused substantial damage to the oil industry. These organizations include the Venezuelan Federation of Oil, Chemical and Allied Workers (FEDEPETROL), the Federation of Oil and Allied Industry Workers (FETRAHIDROCARBUROS) and the National Single Union of Oil Workers (SINUTRAPETROL), who account for  per cent of the contractual and daily workforce. In a joint communication entitled  The oil workers of Venezuela, to the international community represented at the International Labour Organization. To the workers of the world'  representatives of these workers made the following statement:The work stoppage in question was never based on any labour, economic or social demands, for the simple reason that the senior and middle managers do not favour collective bargaining since they are not covered by it. This was a work stoppage whose purpose was to overthrow the President of the Republic, who was legitimately elected by the people and has declared that any alternative aimed at removing him from office must be sought in the framework of the Constitution of the Republic. Those who favoured the work stoppage were the people who had deceived the workers for years from their high executive positions in the oil industry and disregarded their rights, while establishing a whole system of unsavoury privileges and thus always remaining distant from the oil industry workers who were on the contractual payroll.
.More specifically, the Government states that, in February , on the pretext of respect for the  meritocracy'  the former senior and middle managers began to  claim irregularities' in the appointment of a new board of directors for PDVSA, an appointment which was in conformity with the law and clearly laid down in the Organic Oil and Gas Act adopted in November . The slogan adopted at the time was  an alleged violation of the  eritocracy ? the latter being defined as the rise of administrative workers, including senior and middle managers, to highly important posts within the industry. This certainly entailed some sort of demand by the industry s workers in view of the fact that it was not covered by the existing collective agreement or labour legislation in force, namely the Organic Labour Act and its regulations. In March , the political protests were stepped up by these managers, who used blackmail, manipulation of the media (radio, television and press) to convince various oil industry professionals to undertake staggered, partial stoppages of an illegal nature in various administrative areas, refineries and plants of the state oil enterprise PDVSA and its subsidiaries.
.In March , the senior and middle managers continued the partial stoppages in fundamental sectors of the industry, without using any established procedure laid down in the Organic Labour Act and its regulations. These were clearly acts of sabotage and political actions, given the strategic significance of the oil industry for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela inasmuch as it generates  per cent of foreign exchange and revenues to meet public demand for goods, services, education, health care, social programmes, etc. There are also other elements which establish the clear irregularity entailed in the flagrant dereliction of their duties. These former workers abused their employment contract to carry out illegal stoppages of a political nature; as a result, the President of the Republic took the decision to dismiss publicly various managers and retire others in April .
.In mid-March, a parliamentary committee was formed to mediate in the  conflict' created by the PDVSA senior and middle managers. The mediating committee demonstrates the firm resolve of the Executive and State of Venezuela to settle disputes by means of dialogue. The representative of the PDVSA Employees' Conflict Committee and spokesman for the administrative staff of the PDVSA senior and middle management is Mr. Horacio Medina, who would subsequently be the president of the planned trade union UNAPETROL (in addition to having responsibility for business management, as a member of the PDVSA middle management).
.Immediately afterwards, on  April , the CTV, senior and middle managers of the state oil enterprise PDVSA, the employers' organization FEDECAMARAS and sections of the political opposition to the Government called an  indefinite general work stoppage'  and convened a march for  April which was due to go from Parque del Este to PDVSA headquarters in Chuao, both locations within the Municipality of Chacao de Caracas. The PDVSA senior and middle managers took part in this political activity, once again in dereliction of their duties, actively participating in the coup d at of  April , showing once again that the intentions of",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
230,"these former PDVSA workers were, and still are, political actions with the specific aim of rejecting the legitimate authorities of the State of Venezuela, rejecting the Constitution and the democratic regime which prevails in the Republic.
.The mass march planned for  April, referred to above, was diverted from its original route as a result of the unrest caused by the leading representatives of the CTV, FEDECAMARAS, PDVSA senior and middle managers, as well as other political leaders, with the aim of taking the march as far as the Palace of Miraflores, the seat of the Presidency of the Republic, in the Free Municipality of Caracas (about eight kilometres from the original destination of the march authorized by the relevant authorities, namely PDVSA headquarters in Chuao).
.In the vicinity of the Government Palace government supporters were gathered together, as was known by the conveners of the opposition march; at the same time the National Guard was seeking to prevent the two demonstrations (for and against the Government) from meeting, producing a series of violent clashes, which ultimately resulted in  deaths and dozens of casualties. This situation was used as justification, combined with the  meritocracy' proclaimed by the now former PDVSA workers, for the coup d at which established as de facto President, for less than  hours, the president of FEDECAMARAS, who at the time had taken refuge in the Republic of Colombia and was a fugitive from Venezuelan justice.
.These are the same former workers who comprise the planned trade union UNAPETROL, who were members of the PDVSA senior and middle management, who were involved in the coup d at, rejecting the legal PDVSA board of directors, who illegally instigated stoppages on various occasions in the oil industry, and who demonstrated overt political opposition to the Head of State.
.It should be noted that these former senior and middle managers were pardoned and no form of reprisal was taken against them after the Venezuelan people and the national armed forces re-established democracy, restoring the Constitution and the powers of the State abolished by the dictator Carmona. They were not punished after the people restored the President of the Republic to power who had been detained and abducted by a group of military accomplices of the dictator Carmona. Even the President of the Republic, on returning as Head of State on the morning of  April , accepted the resignation of the PDVSA board of directors, which had been communicated to him by the PDVSA board days before the illegal oil industry stoppage and the coup d at.
.Subsequently, the dismissed managers were incorporated in the reorganization of the new PDVSA board of directors, no action of any kind was taken against those who supported the illegal work stoppage, at the conciliation meetings some members of the senior and middle management who illegally paralysed activities formed part of the PDVSA board of directors or its senior management, until they again illegally paralysed the enterprise in December , this time calling for the revocation of the mandate of the Head of State. Prior to the work stoppage in December , these former PDVSA senior and middle managers joined the stoppage of  October, again called a  national work stoppage'  convened by the business sectors represented in FEDECAMARAS and part of the workers' sector under the control of the CTV, with no explanation given of the grounds for the stoppage.
.At the same time, also in October, various sections of the opposition, including the former senior and middle managers now representing the planned union UNAPETROL,  collected' a number of signatures which were presented on  November to the National Electoral Council, where they requested a consultative referendum to be carried out in order to ask the question  Do you agree with requesting the President of the Republic, citizen Hugo Chvez Fras, to relinquish his post voluntarily and immediately?' This request was unconstitutional since a consultative referendum is concerned with matters of national relevance, not with the revocation of mandates: the latter is covered by a revocatory referendum laid down in article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
.These former PDVSA senior and middle managers, as well as various political parties, FEDECAMARAS, the CTV and dissident sections of the national armed forces issued the call for an indefinite  civic work stoppage' on a nationwide basis. The evolution and impact of the  stoppage' affected the social, political and economic levels. On the national economic level, the stoppage was basically sustained by total paralysis of the oil industry;  per cent of the working class did not take part in the aforementioned stoppage and an equivalent percentage did not support this act of sabotage aimed at overthrowing the democratically elected government. The only participants were some small businesses, most of which were obliged to close by sections of the opposition, and some public services, as well as basic services of the public subsector controlled by the opposition (including health care, education and local government offices).
.Subsequently, the private banks joined in the stoppage, limiting their public opening hours and in turn restricting financial operations at national and international level. At the same time, senior and middle managers of the oil industry, which was at a standstill, set themselves the task of sabotaging the industry s operations through the disconnection and closure of computer control systems. This was done on orders from the senior and middle managers already frequently referred to in the present allegations, who also issued instructions to the workers on the daily and contractual payrolls of PDVSA and their subsidiaries to return home. The paralysis of the oil industry affected other sectors of industry which depended on primary production; it also paralysed a number of businesses which were obliged to stop or reduce their operations for lack of fuel. One example of this was the transport sector, which never took part in the work stoppage but was partially and involuntarily paralysed on certain occasions for lack of fuel.
.On a daily basis, during the paralysis of the oil industry, some former members of the PDVSA board of directors ' former PDVSA senior and middle managers, who had been pardoned and were back in their posts after the coup d at of April  ' appeared in the opposition media, once again making explicit calls  to paralyse the industry until the dictator departs'  This continued for nearly two months, with the voluntary dereliction of their duty posts being a clear, precise, well-known and public feature of the situation.
.During the paralysis of the oil industry, the price of oil had an impact on the international economy. This increase was due not only to the reduction in Venezuelan oil stock on the market but also in the drop in fuel sales in countries to which Venezuela exports its products, including Central American and Caribbean countries. It depleted the oil reserves of these countries which enjoy preferential sales. The main customer of the region, the United States, also suffered the repercussions of this illegal work stoppage whose aim was to overthrow a democratically elected president. It also produced something which had been unthinkable in Venezuela, one of the leading oil producers, in the last  years: imports of petrol.
.The work stoppage instigated by the former senior and middle managers and former and planned leaders of UNAPETROL, as well as the former presidents of FEDECAMARAS and the CTV, Carlos Fernandez, Carlos Ortega and members of the executive committee of each of the named trade unions, gave rise to the closure of various private businesses and enterprises, especially in the sector of goods and services, which reduced the capacity of society to meet the needs of the Venezuelan people with respect to health care, foodstuffs and education, among others. This embroiled the country in a massive crisis of major impact, with the direct aim of bringing down the President of the Republic and the authority conferred on him by the sovereign people of Venezuela in free and democratic elections.
.In political terms, the stoppage went beyond national boundaries, not only involving the international community but also the Organization of American States (OAS), the leading regional organization, as well as its member countries in statements of support for Venezuelan democracy and for the work of the  facilitator' of negotiations and agreements between the national government and the opposition, under way since November . The facilitating role was performed by the OAS Secretary-General, Dr. Csar Gaviria, at the request of the national executive and as a way of seeking a peaceful solution to the acute crisis.
.Despite dialogue being instigated, these former oil workers and the irrational sections of the opposition in Venezuela nevertheless prompted the stoppage of activities in our principal industry. This means that the aim of these former senior and middle managers and their supporters in the industry was not the  meritocracy' or better working conditions than those which they more than any other section of Venezuelan society have enjoyed historically. It is",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
231,"apparent that the intention was to overthrow President Hugo Chvez Fras and to this end they are almost destroying the oil industry in Venezuela.
.As regards the sociocultural aspect, the implications of this episode of sabotage for the oil economy and industry should also be analysed. It is reflected in the mental health of the Venezuelan people, their social development being restricted in the majority of cases. The private media were not communicating: they were issuing dirty propaganda and lying to the national and international community; the public media were not informing people, they were manipulating and distorting information, causing offence and showing a direct bias towards a specific wealthy sector of the population. The climate of political conflict and social aggression fostered by the opposition and their media has imposed an emotional burden on the people which has not left everyone unscathed, with a heavy impact on the most vulnerable age groups, such as the elderly and children, who have been systematically exposed to visual and audio messages containing various forms of violence, infringing in most cases people s right to free development of personality, to recreation and to living in peace. These events involved the active and systematic participation of the opposition leaders and the , people dismissed from the oil industry, dismissals which were the result of their voluntary dereliction of duty for more than  days, the time limit for launching the procedure for legal dismissal in accordance with the labour standards in force.
.To sum up, all the actions of the former oil industry managers, described above, was the result of a well-conceived plan which cost US$ billion in losses for the Republic owing to the illegal paralysis of the oil industry. All of this was accompanied by shipping used for the nationwide transfer of fuel and for the transport of oil and its by-products to world markets being brought to a standstill, and remote sabotage or blockage via Internet or satellite of computer systems for the automated control of extraction, refining, distribution and marketing activities. It resulted in the PDVSA daily and contractual workers being unable to exercise their right to work, as well as causing GDP to plummet, inflation to rise and unemployment to soar on an unimaginable scale, with the loss of , jobs. The trade unions FEDEPETROL, FETRAHIDROCARBUROS and SINUTRAPETROL issued a press release which is reproduced in the next paragraph.
. We, the workers on the contractual payroll, never participated in the work stoppage and kept the oil and gas supply plants in operation, which was a difficult task. We had to do the work of the senior managers, in view of their dereliction of duties in the absence of any legal or contractual claim. We, the workers on the daily payroll, have just signed our collective agreement, in which we obtained fair benefits. Faced with the irresponsibility of our supervisors in abandoning their duties without cause, we, the , contractual workers, set our men the patriotic task of preventing our principal industry from collapsing and our people from being overtaken by despair and chaos, with an unpredictable outcome that we would still be regretting.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.As regards the Government s alleged refusal to register the planned trade union UNAPETROL, the Government points out that the latter organization was planned by a group of former senior and middle managers of the state oil enterprise PDVSA, namely Mr. Horacio Medina, qualified engineer, employed at the subsidiary PDVSA Produccin, negotiation strategy manager belonging to the middle management payroll; Mr. Edgar Quijano, qualified in industrial relations, employed at PDVSA headquarters, adviser belonging to the senior management payroll; Antonio Mndez, qualified chemical engineer, employed at the subsidiary PROESCA, business manager belonging to the middle management payroll; Ronald Figueroa, qualified engineer, employed at the subsidiary PDVSA-GAS, head of IT belonging to the senior management payroll.
.The planned trade union UNAPETROL comprises members of the senior and middle management payrolls holding posts such as analysts, secretaries, engineers, specialists, etc., in subordinate positions to those of the abovementioned managers.
.The Government states that on  July  ten citizens went to the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Public Sector) and expressed their desire to establish a trade union entitled the  National Union of Oil, Gas, Petrochemical and Refinery Workers (UNAPETROL)'  in respect of which they submitted the documentation laid down by article  of the Organic Labour Act.
.On  July , the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector), pursuant to article  of the Organic Labour Act, issued communication No. - to citizen Al Rodrguez Araque as President of Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), notifying him of the workers' proposal to establish the trade union, which was received by the aforementioned enterprise on  July .
.On  July , the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Public Sector), by means of Order No. -, ordered the trading company PDVSA to supply documents which would enable the accuracy of the information furnished by the promoters of the planned trade union to be verified, in relation to the duties that they actually perform, pursuant to article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in accordance with article  of the Organic Act on Administrative Proceedings.
.On  August , the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) issued administrative ruling No. - refusing registration of the planned trade union entitled  National Union of Oil, Gas, Petrochemical and Refinery Workers (UNAPETROL)'  on the basis of articles (a) and (a) of the Organic Labour Act, stating that the aforementioned organization did not aim to fulfil the purposes laid down in articles  and  of that Act, and in conformity with the provisions of article  of the regulations of that Act.
.On  August , citizens Horacio Medina, Edgar Quijano and Ronald Figueroa, acting in the capacity of president, labour assistant secretary and institutional relations secretary, respectively, of the planned trade union UNAPETROL lodged a hierarchical administrative appeal, with the aim of seeking to overturn the abovementioned administrative ruling and, consequently, requesting the registration of the trade union, claiming, inter alia, violation of the right of defence laid down in article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela:  ...with respect to the decision to refuse the registration of UNAPETROL on the basis of evidence and presumptions and not on any of the grounds of article  of the Organic Labour Act, it did not allow the UNAPETROL representatives to defend themselves in order to rectify any deficiency. If the official had discovered any deficiency, he should have given notification thereof and applied the second period of thirty () days laid down in article  of the aforementioned Act, but he failed to do so. On the other hand, the official stated that an appeal against his decision could be brought before the Labour Minister, in such a way that he shortened the second applicable period of thirty () days' 
.On  November , this administrative appeal body issued Decision No. , concerning the hierarchical appeal made on  August , ordering the  restoration of the infringed legal situation, i.e. that the labour inspector should formulate the relevant observations with respect to the documentation submitted by the promoters of the planned trade union  ?
.On  November , the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector), by means of Order No. -, refrained from taking the present proceedings any further, since he had previously given his opinion in refusing to register the planned trade union.
.On  December , the Director-General for Labour issued an administrative ruling declaring the aforementioned course of action by the Director to be admissible and authorized the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) to attend to the present proceedings.
.On  December , the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) issued an order instructing the planned trade union to rectify the deficiencies in the documentation it had supplied and to furnish all relevant information relating to provision of service by the promoters of the union, in accordance with article  of the Organic Labour Act. Notification of the aforementioned order took place on  December .

.On  January , the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) issued an order instructing the PDVSA enterprise to supply documents enabling the accuracy of information provided by the promoters to be verified, relating to the actual duties performed by the latter",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
232,"and by the supposed members of the planned trade union, pursuant to article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in accordance with article  of the Organic Act on Administrative Proceedings, and ratifying the content of the order of  December , according to which the employees promoting the union, as well as the supposed members, did not enjoy irremovability because the three-month irremovability period expired on  October .
.On  January , the secretary for official documentation, referred to above, sent a membership list without signatures of  supposed members.
.On  January , the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) referred the file of the application for registration of the planned trade union to the Political and Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, on account of the planned trade union s appeal for the quashing of administrative ruling No. - of  August .
.On  May , the Political and Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice sent the Labour Minister, on the one hand, a certified copy of the decision issued by the aforementioned Chamber on  March , following the withdrawal of the appeal for cancellation by the planned trade union, and, on the other hand, the file of the application for registration of the planned trade union.
.On  June , the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) issued an order whereby he agreed to attend to the present proceedings, incorporate in the file all communications together with their attachments received by him between  January and the present time and notify the representatives of the planned trade union. The communications incorporated under the aforementioned order include the communication of  January , whereby the representatives of the planned trade union submitted to the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) an appeal to review the order of  December  and request inhibition of the Director of the aforementioned National Inspectorate.
.On  June , the First Administrative Court sent to the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) a certified copy of the ruling it had issued on that date, allowing the appeal for cancellation submitted by the planned trade union, admitting the claim for an interim ruling and suspending the effects of the contested administrative rulings until such time as the principal action was resolved.
.On  July , the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) issued administrative ruling No. - deciding to:Refuse to register the planned National Union of Oil, Gas, Petrochemical and Refinery Workers (UNAPETROL), inasmuch as, under article  of the regulations of the Organic Labour Act, a trade union may not be established which seeks to represent the interests of both workers and employers, and also on account of the failure to rectify within the prescribed deadline the deficiencies and omissions observed by this office in the supplied documentation.
.On  July , citizens Horacio Medina, Jorge Rodrguez, Edgar Quijano, Antonio Mndez and Ronald Figueroa, in their respective capacities as members of the executive committee of the planned trade union, submitted a hierarchical appeal against administrative ruling No. -, dated  July , requesting inhibition of the Labour Minister with respect to taking cognizance of the appeal, revocation of the aforementioned administrative ruling and revival of the case, as well as requesting that the defects and omissions to be rectified by the planned trade union be indicated clearly.
.Furthermore, the contents of the file show that the main promoters of the planned trade union UNAPETROL made direct representations in the past to the Ministry of Labour on behalf of PDVSA in order to resolve labour disputes within the enterprise. It is also public knowledge that some of the promoters of UNAPETROL stated that they occupied posts as managers, administrators and heads of personnel.
.The Government reproduces below the content of Decision No. , dated  October , issued by the Labour Minister. The main points thereof are summarized below, in particular as regards fulfilment of the minimum requirements laid down by law for the establishment of trade unions, omitting issues concerning the request for inhibition of the Labour Minister or legal interpretations of certain formal requirements.
.The most important paragraphs of Decision No.  are as follows:Under article  of the Organic Labour Act, trade unions that wish to organize themselves on a regional or national basis must be registered with the National Labour Inspectorate. When making the request for registration, the applicants must submit a copy of the deed of establishment of the union, a copy of the union statutes and a list of the founder members, with the documents signed by all members of the executive committee, as explicitly stipulated by article  of the Act.As regards the fulfilment of such requirements, the appellants make the following statement in their written communication: Our representative had already supplied all the documents referred to by articles ,  and  of the Organic Labour Act, i.e. she had performed her task of supplying, together with the application, the deed of establishment of the union and its statutes, as well as a list of the founder members clearly stating the full name, nationality, age, profession/occupation and place of residence of each founder member of the union. Consequently, there is no item of legislation obliging us to indicate, as wrongly stated by the abovementioned labour official,  ?the specific type or status of the workers proposing the planned trade union  ? In this respect, we wondered where he got such a  requirement' from, given that neither the Organic Labour Act nor the subsidiary legislation that was alleged to have been infringed, i.e. its regulations, mention it. his is backed up with the following paragraph: Moreover, it should be noted that the labour official s action requesting the proponents of the trade union to give details of  ?the posts occupied by all of them, according to the type of services they provide for the trading company Petrleos de Venezuela S.A.  ? i.e. give details of  the type of activities performed by each of the workers, so that his/her true employment status may be ascertained  ? constitutes an abuse of duties and unauthorized interference in the matter protected by article  of the constitution (sic) and Convention No. , to which there are repeated references, and thus violates the content of article  of the Organic Labour Act, which does not state that such requirements must be indicated in the list of founder members. otwithstanding the appellants' statement, this ministerial office is bound to point out that the Director of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector), by an order dated  January , made the following statement: ...as regards the precautions relating to membership, it is clear that a substantial number of both proponents and employees joining the union belong to the senior and middle management of the Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) enterprise, occupying posts (as seen from the lists supplied) as senior and middle managers, supervisors and advisers. Now, under article  of the Organic Labour Act,  ?persons exercising managerial or administrative functions shall be considered as representatives of the employers even if not explicitly assigned that function  ?and taking into account that the representatives of the employers are, in turn, managerial employees as defined by article  of the aforementioned Act, this could make it difficult or impossible for them to meet the objectives laid down for workers' unions, since as representatives of the employers they would not be able at the same time to represent and defend the workers in negotiations and collective labour disputes, or in conciliation and arbitration proceedings, as laid down by article  of the aforementioned Act. he abovementioned order added the following: ...the establishment of a trade union organization comprising representatives of the employer who also participate in the executive committee of that organization as representatives of the workers vis--vis the enterprise might violate the  urity principle' referred to in article  of the regulations of the Organic Labour Act, which prohibits the establishment of mixed organizations. rom a reading of the grounds (quoted in part) contained in the order dated  January of this year, it may be noted that the appellants had been duly informed with regard to the legal prohibition on establishing mixed trade unions on account of clear violation of the  purity principle'  The sole purpose of the request to the proponents, as recorded in the order dated  December  (pages -), to rectify the aforementioned deficiencies  ...by adding to the information and documentation which was initially provided  ? is to comply with ministerial decision No. , dated  November , instructing the official in question to inform the applicants whether there is any deficiency in the documentation supplied for the purposes of registration so that, should that be the",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
233,"case, such deficiencies could be rectified in accordance with the relevant provisions. Hence the official in question was safeguarding the exercise of the interested parties' right to be informed and right of defence, inherent to the process of registration of the proposed trade union. Even though the proponents supplied the list of founder members indicating their professions or occupations, in accordance with article  of the Organic Labour Act, the fact remains that the Labour Inspectorate informed the proponents on two occasions '  December  and  January  ' that, under our legislation, it was not possible to establish trade unions composed of employers' representatives whose purpose would be to represent the workers, since this entails a violation of the  purity principle' Furthermore, the proponents had the opportunity to supply the requested information and rectify the deficiencies arising from the actual application which initiated the procedure for registration of the proposed trade union. That opportunity existed for more than seven months, since, in view of the mistaken and untimely submission of an appeal for nullity to the Political and Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice (file No. -), the administrative records were referred respectfully to the aforementioned judicial body. (' . The  purity principle' is laid down in article  of the regulations of the Organic Labour Act, imposing a requirement which absolutely must be upheld by the labour inspector and, in addition, is recognized internationally (' .Similarly, Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), states as follows: Workers' and employers' organizations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other s agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. In particular, acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organizations under the domination of employers or employers' organizations, or to support workers' organizations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such organizations under the control of employers or employers' organizations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference within the meaning of this article. onsequently, having signed and ratified the aforementioned Convention, the State assumes the duty this imposes on it, namely to guarantee appropriate protection for workers' organizations with regard to any act of interference by the employers, directly or through their representatives or agents. In particular, measures which are designed to promote workers' organizations with the object of placing them under the control of the employers shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference. Hence, when the labour inspector, pursuant to Decision No. , issued the order dated  December  and requested the proponents to provide further information, in order to  ...accurately determine the specific type or status of the workers promoting the proposed trade union  ?and informed them on two occasions of the  purity principle'  he was giving them the fullest possible freedom to supply anything relevant in response to the order which would enable it to be proven that, although the proponents had described themselves as directors, managers, administrators and heads of industrial relations, they were not representatives of the employers, thereby undermining the legal presumption contained in articles  and  of the Organic Labour Act (' .Article  of the regulations of the Organic Labour Act which lays down the  purity principle' also lays down in its final section the explicit prohibition to which management employees are subject. This explicit prohibition is drafted in the following terms:  the management employees shall not establish workers' unions or become members of them'  This prohibition was established by means of Decree No. , dated  December , published in Official Gazette special issue No. , dated  January , as a measure to ensure fulfilment of the  purity principle' Similarly, the Social Affairs Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice has stated explicitly and repeatedly that oil industry employees who occupy what are defined as senior or middle management posts may be deemed to be management employees, as expressly stated in ruling No.  dated  February .Since in the present case the same proponents, by supplying the list of founder members in accordance with article  of the Organic Labour Act, state voluntarily and on their own initiative that they occupy posts as managers, administrators and heads of personnel, while making the same assertion in various parts of the mass media, their status within the enterprise therefore being public knowledge, article  of the aforementioned Act states that these are management posts and, consequently, their holders are representatives of the employer, in accordance with article  of the Act. This prevents these management employees from establishing a workers' union or joining a previously established workers' union, as explicitly stated in the final section of article  of the regulations of the Organic Labour Act.The status of management employee in the case of at least  of the proponents or founders was determined in the appealed administrative ruling No. -, pp. -, this office having no doubts regarding the examination conducted by the National Labour Inspector who attended to the case and whose arguments are deemed to have been set out in the present decision (' .Moreover, it should be emphasized that the appellants also omitted to take account of the order dated  January of this year, in which the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector), ratifying the order of  January , stated as follows: Similarly, since the labour administration is bound to act in conformity with the law pursuant to article  of the Organic Labour Act and ensure that the constitutional principle of the prevalence of reality over forms and appearances in labour relations is upheld, as expressly stated in article () of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, it is obliged to order the Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) trading company, as a party concerned, to supply documents enabling the accuracy of the information supplied by the proponents to be verified, regarding the posts actually held by the members of the proposed trade union UNAPETROL, pursuant to article  of our Carta Magna, in accordance with article  of the Organic Act on Administrative Proceedings. At all events, Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) is hereby informed that the requirement to supply information and documentation does not endow the aforementioned enterprise with belligerent status to intervene in the procedure for union registration, since that would imply interference by the employer, which is prohibited in article  of the Organic Labour Act and Article  of Convention No. , of the International Labour Organization. It has been thus decided. rom the quoted text it is clear that in issuing the order, apart from the latter having a legal and regulatory basis, the Department clearly and emphatically informed the enterprise that the information required did not endow it with belligerent status, i.e. it did not make it party to the procedure for registration of the proposed trade union UNAPETROL, since that might imply a violation of article  of the Organic Labour Act and Article  of Convention No. , of the International Labour Organization (' .It can be seen from the statements by the appellants that they raise two specific objections, namely: (a) that the order instructing them to rectify the deficiencies was vague and imprecise; and (b) that no decision was made regarding the application for review of the order dated  December  and prior to that, on the other hand, the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) issued its final decision refusing to register UNAPETROL. In this respect, this ministerial office would make the following points:With regard to the first claim, i.e. the supposed vagueness and imprecision of the orders dated  December  and  January , it is clear that the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector), acting in conformity with the principles of freedom of association, particularly avoiding any undue interference, respectfully requested the proponents to supply additional data and information which would enable their status to be evaluated. This immediate request was made pursuant to the abovementioned ministerial Decision No. . Now, in the absence of the information requested from the proponents, a new order was sent, also on  January , indicating the risks of infringing the  purity principle'  whose validity derives from article  of the regulations of the Organic Labour Act, as quoted above. This last order, contained in the instructions of the aforementioned ministerial decision, was absolutely precise and specific.It has already been stated that the proponents had the opportunity to make the rectifications and supply the required information to the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector) for at least six months before the appealed administrative ruling was issued, without the Labour Administration s request being complied with in accordance with the provisions in force.Furthermore, regarding the order dated  December ,",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
234,"whereby the National Inspectorate (Private Sector) ordered the deficiencies to be rectified and of which the proponents were notified on  December  ' which means that within the following  days the latter could submit an appeal for review pursuant to article  of the Organic Act on Administrative Proceedings, as indeed they did on  January , that appeal had to be resolved by the official who issued the order. Now, since it could not be resolved within the  days following the submission of the appeal, the proponents had the right to lodge the hierarchical appeal in accordance with article  of the aforementioned Act, since, given the administrative silence of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs Department (Private Sector), it was to be understood that the application for review had been refused, as expressly laid down in article  of the Organic Act on Administrative Proceedings in the following terms: Article . In cases where a public administrative body does not resolve a matter or appeal within the relevant deadlines, the response shall be deemed to be negative and the interested party shall be able to appeal to the immediately following instance, unless explicitly stated otherwise. This provision does not relieve the administrative bodies or their officers of the responsibilities that would fall upon them as a result of any omission or delay. In other words, once the -day period granted by the Organic Act to the official to resolve the appeal for review had expired without his having made any decision, the interested parties become immediately entitled to appeal to the immediately following instance, in this case to submit the hierarchical appeal brought before this ministerial office on account of the negative administrative silence. Since this was not done, however, the appealed decision stands and it is implicit that the interested parties have accepted the negative decision and, consequently, must comply with the order to provide further information in addition to what they supplied with the application for registration.On account of the foregoing, this office does not share the appellants' opinion that their right of defence was infringed by the orders of  December  and  January , since the fact that the proponents did not exercise the rights granted to them by law cannot be ascribed to the Administration as an infringement of such rights, and it has been thus decided.According to the appellants, workers who wish to join a trade union which is being established are not obliged to notify the labour inspector directly, nor is it necessary for such notification to be signed by the would-be member himself. In the first case, this is because notification may be made via the trade union or via any person designated by it; in the second case, because a signature may be required only in cases where it is expressly laid down by law. In this regard this office would make the following points:On the basis of various different legal interpretations, the ministerial office rejects the arguments put forward by the appellants on this point and endorses the conclusion contained in the appealed administrative ruling, as follows: Examination of the lists of the supposed members of the planned trade union shows that they appear to be simple copies of the lists of workers of PDVSA and its subsidiaries, without any trace of employee signatures, letterheads, logos or official stamps of those enterprises. In addition, examination of all the supposed memberships shows that none of them is supported by the employees supposedly seeking to join the proposed trade union. It is therefore absolutely clear, for whomever it may concern, that the membership process was never officially completed for any of those employees, since the latter did not expressly request it. It has been thus decided. or the reasons described above, this ministerial office, by virtue of its competence and the exercise of its functions, described in articles  and (a) of the Organic Labour Act, dismisses the submitted appeal (' .Finally, this office duly points out to the interested parties which consider their rights to have been infringed that they may appeal against the present decision to the Political and Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice no later than ten days after notification of the present decision, pursuant to article  of the Organic Labour Act.
.Moreover, as regards the mass dismissals of senior and middle managers from PDVSA and its subsidiaries during the  national civic work stoppage' in December  and January , the Government declares that grounds for dismissal constitute one of the forms of unilateral termination of employment. The other is justified retirement.
.Under article  of the Organic Labour Act, the following actions by a worker constitute grounds for dismissal:(a) lack of integrity or immoral conduct at work;(b) acts of violence, except in legitimate defence;(c) insults or serious lack of due respect or consideration to the employer, his representatives or members of his household;(d) deliberate action or serious negligence affecting safety and health in the workplace;(e) omissions or carelessness which seriously affect safety and health in the workplace;(f) unjustified absence from work for three working days in a month. Illness of the worker shall be deemed to be sufficient grounds for absence from work. The worker shall notify the employer of the reason for his absence from work, provided there are no circumstances to prevent him from doing so;(g) material damage caused intentionally or as a result of negligence to machines, tools or utensils, company furniture, raw materials or finished products or products being manufactured, plantations or other property;(h) disclosure of secrets relating to manufacturing and its methods;(i) serious failure to discharge employment obligations. This refers to the obligations arising from the employment relationship. A good guideline for how this applies to the worker is provided by article  of the Organic Labour Act, which states that, the worker shall be obliged to perform the services which are compatible with his strength, skills, condition or status and of the same type as those constituting the purpose of the activity undertaken by the employer (' . Where the required work is not, in the worker s opinion, of the type that he is obliged to perform, he must nevertheless do it, provided that it is not manifestly inappropriate and does not endanger the worker himself or the activity of the enterprise, establishment or operation of the employer, pointing out the lack of conformity to the employer or his representative, without compliance with the order implying acceptance of the changes to the working conditions, if such was the case;(j) dereliction of duty. Examples thereof are: (a) untimely and unjustified departure of the worker during working hours from the workplace, without permission from the employer or his representative; or (b) refusal to work in the places to which the worker has been assigned, provided that these are in accordance with the respective contract or law. A worker s refusal to perform a task which entails a serious and immediate danger to his life or health shall not be deemed to constitute dereliction of duty. Otherwise: (c) the unjustified absence from work of a worker in charge of a task or machine, where such absence signifies disruption to the execution of the remaining work, also constitutes dereliction of duty.
.The Government describes the action taken by PDVSA with regard to the notices in the national and regional press for all of the dismissed workers:
.The citizens are hereby notified that:The Presidency of Petrleo de Venezuela S.A. and PDVSA Petrleo S.A., by virtue of its powers under the deed of establishment and its statutes, has decided to dispense with [their] labour services, terminating [their] employment as from  January , since [they] have given grounds, individually and in every case, for justified dismissal under article (a), (f), (i) and (j) of the Organic Labour Act, in accordance with articles ,  and  of its regulations.The citizens identified above have given grounds, individually and in every case, for justified dismissal under article (a) of the Organic Labour Act, in accordance with article (c) of its regulations, inasmuch as they have committed various actions which are contrary to the due integrity they are bound to maintain as workers of this enterprise. It is a well-known fact, widely publicized by the mass media, that their conduct has contributed to the illegal paralysis of the economic activities of this enterprise since  December  inasmuch as it has not been based on labour claims or rights but, on the contrary, has been of an exclusively political nature. This conduct, as well as other actions of which they have been guilty during the period indicated, constitutes a failure to show due diligence and loyalty to their employer within the employment relationship, and this has caused serious harm to the property of this enterprise and considerable damage to its reputation and good name.They have also given grounds, individually and in every case, for justified dismissal under article (f) of the Organic",-1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
235,"Labour Act, in accordance with article  of its regulations, inasmuch as they were absent from work without justification. Each of the named citizens were absent from work without justification on , , , , , ,, , , , , , , , , , , ,  and  December  and , , ,  and  January .Moreover, they have given grounds, individually and in every case, for justified dismissal under article (i) of the Organic Labour Act, in accordance with article (a) and (b) and article  of its regulations, inasmuch as they have performed various actions which are contrary to the fundamental obligations imposed by their employment at this enterprise. As stated above, they have participated in an illegal paralysis of the economic activities of this enterprise since  December , the purpose of which has clearly been unconnected with the business of the enterprise. They were not present to provide their services on the days stated, without any valid cause to justify their absence. Such conduct, as well as other actions of which they have been guilty, clearly implies a serious and intentional violation of their employment obligations.Finally, the named citizens have given grounds, individually and in every case, for justified dismissal under article (j) of the Organic Labour Act, inasmuch as they were guilty of dereliction of duty. In this regard it should be noted that since  December  they have refused to fulfil their working obligations and provide their services in their customary tasks, joining and inciting an illegal stoppage of the economic activities of this enterprise, which constitutes a flagrant violation of every worker s fundamental duties, under article (b) and (c) of the Organic Labour Act. Moreover, it should also be noted that, among the various forms of conduct of which each worker has been guilty, their unjustified absence and refusal to provide their customary services has seriously disrupted the smooth running and economic activities of the enterprise.For all the aforementioned reasons and on the relevant legal grounds, the employment relationship between this enterprise and the named citizens is terminated as from  January . Consequently, all of the named citizens must present themselves, no later than  hours after this notification of dismissal, at our human resources and loss prevention and control offices in order to formalize the physical surrender of property belonging to this enterprise which until today has been assigned to their use and custody, as well as to comply with internal proceedings and standards. Similarly, within the same deadline, all the named citizens must hand over their respective identity cards, keys to our offices and other installations of the enterprise, including cards, codes and keys for computerized security systems which were assigned to them and which henceforth must not be used.
.The Government points out that, prior to the public notification of the justified dismissals by PDVSA, the Labour Ministry authorities undertook supervisory action to verify in situ whether or not the workers of PDVSA and its subsidiaries occupied permanent posts, whereupon the relevant documents were issued.
.Furthermore, with regard to the supposed violations of labour rights resulting from the dismissals for mass dereliction of duty by the former senior and middle managers, the non?payment of social benefits and other employment income received by the former oil industry workers, the evictions from dwellings in the oilfields and the non-enrolment of children in schools belonging to, or run by, PDVSA under the collective agreement in force, the Government makes the following observations:' The separation of those dismissed by PDVSA on justified grounds under the Organic Labour Act, as publicly communicated to the former PDVSA workers, referred to above, means that their employment ceases immediately, as do the benefits accruing under the work contract (housing, schooling, savings bank and other benefits).' The evictions undertaken since the cessation of employment were legal, with due process observed and dialogue mechanisms and facilities to ensure that the former workers and their families had the opportunity to relocate maintained for over six months. This was successfully implemented for a very high percentage of the former workers who occupied housing and whose children enjoyed benefits in the schools under the responsibility of the oil industry. The former oil workers vacated peacefully and in full awareness of the situation the PDVSA housing which the company had granted them as part of their employment benefits. Nevertheless, a minority of those dismissed from PDVSA and its subsidiaries for dereliction of duty were unwilling to vacate the housing assigned by, and belonging to, PDVSA or its subsidiaries. These former workers adopted a political stance, claiming that their human rights were being violated when the fact of the matter was that the evictions were undertaken on the basis of judicial orders fulfilling the requirements of the law. Use of the forces of law and order was necessary so that the judicial officers could implement the relevant measures, in view of the fact that some of the oil workers refused systematically, rudely and violently to vacate the PDVSA housing. In isolated cases, even some of the former workers attacked the police officers responsible for enforcing the law, verbally abused the judicial officers who had ordered the legal evictions from the housing and even made mass appeals to the public to act in their defence, with a view to preventing the execution of the judicial orders for eviction from the PDVSA housing. All of this was blown up out of all proportion, manipulated and exaggerated by the radio, television and press personnel who accompanied these former workers with the aim of disrupting order, damaging the oil industry and bringing the economy of the Republic to its knees.' As regards the complainants' claims, concerning the children s right to education, that they were not allowed to enrol in the PDVSA schools, the Government points out that a reasonable time was given to the former workers and their families to vacate the PDVSA housing. In the higher interests of social justice, the former workers who were illegally occupying the housing were given clear permission for their children to complete the school year in the schools belonging to, or run by, PDVSA. At the end of the school year in July , the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport issued precise instructions to the public and private school educational areas and supervisory districts to guarantee the right to education for the children and ensure that they were enrolled in the public schools, thereby guaranteeing the right to education of the children of the former oil workers, who, no longer being in the oil industry, do not have the rights, prerogatives or privileges enjoyed by the workers who are active in the PDVSA oil enterprise and its subsidiaries.' As regards the references to non-payment of social benefits, the latter are guaranteed by the industry and are held in their respective trust funds pending withdrawal thereof by the former workers. The latter have not withdrawn the benefits because they decided to have recourse to administrative and judicial reinstatement proceedings, which they did voluntarily, so it is untrue that the enterprise withheld the benefits.
.As regards the individual dismissals in the oil industry, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela states that owing to the sabotage carried out by the former workers who took part in the oil industry  work stoppage' (direct sabotage of the computing systems of PDVSA and its subsidiaries), PDVSA did not have the relevant data available concerning the list of employees and the circumstances of a large number of workers who were on holiday, sick leave, maternity leave or official leave in the form of foreign scholarships, trade union immunity, vacations and others, under the abovementioned circumstances. Owing to these anomalies, the company wrongfully dismissed a number of workers but immediately rectified the errors it had committed. This could be done as a result of each worker giving proof of his or her status and by reconstructing the lists of workers incorporated in the computer systems which had been sabotaged, as described above. In order to rectify the errors made, PDVSA set up an office so that the workers could exercise their right of complaint, presenting the relevant proofs so that the situation could be resolved. After the computer systems were restored, it emerged that , workers of PDVSA and its subsidiaries had been wrongfully dismissed. The company proceeded to rectify this involuntary error and the dismissed workers were reinstated, so that their employment with PDVSA and its subsidiaries is continuing, as are the forms of special leave for those still entitled to them, and all employment benefits (wages, allowances, etc.) which had been retained were paid.
.As regards the allegation by the ICFTU concerning the murder on  May of a worker belonging to the CTV, the Government wishes to state that it deplores the death of persons on its territory resulting from any act of violence. Moreover, it drew attention to the ICFTU s haste to send the allegations en",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
236,"comento, since it is clearly seeking to demonstrate to the Committee on Freedom of Association that the death of Mr. Herrera was the result of violence on the part of government supporters or members of the state security forces against CTV union activity, specifically suggesting that bodies belonging to the National Executive or Government supporters do not allow the exercise of the freedom of association or of the right to organize or, even worse, do not allow the free exercise of both rights. The above can be deduced from the vagueness of the ICFTU statement. The Government points out that Mr. Herrera, a member of FETRACONSTRUCCION, was regrettably murdered a few minutes after the end of the  May celebrations held by the CTV and the political organizations which instigated the coup d at in April  and the economic sabotage arising from the  civil work stoppage'  The events surrounding Mr. Herrera s death occurred some distance from the gathering of CTV followers, which had now been dispersing for a few minutes, at Plaza O eary del Silencio. Information compiled reveals that the murder of Mr. Herrera was due to an argument between a number of people. The suspect in the homicide was Mr. Manuel Arias, who drew a gun during the argument and fired two shots, which hit and killed Mr. Herrera. This event was immediately used by sections of the opposition, centred on the so-called  democratic coordination' to which the CTV belongs, to seek to show, by means of live broadcasts and then repeatedly via the opinions of politicians and leaders of the  democratic coordination'  as well as through videos and written communications, that those behind the murder of Mr. Herrera are supporters of the national Government, and explicitly accusing the President of the Republic, Hugo Chvez Fras.
.During this deplorable incident, the murder of Mr. Herrera, national and international public opinion was irresponsibly informed that this was  the work of a pro-Chvez hired assassin'  and the same tone was adopted by the private communication media before, during and after the coup d at instigated by the  democratic coordination'  CTV and FEDECAMARAS in April .
.The ICFTU s use of  unidentified persons' (in the plural) in its statements shows the ICFTU s tendency to distort information or perhaps the manipulation to which this international organization was or is exposed, given its echoing of information which has been twisted or manipulated by the press, radio and television, or in view of the credence it gives to the political opinions of the members of the CTV executive committee concerning events which have nothing to do with freedom of association.
.The Government formulates the following conclusions:' The person responsible for the shots and the presumed murder of Mr. Herrera, Mr. Arias, was detained by the police.' Department VI of the Attorney-General s Office investigated the case.' Examining magistrate  issued an order for the detention of the suspect while the court in question tried him on the charges laid down by the Attorney-General s Office in the relevant file.' The facts demonstrated that there was no interference by government supporters nor any involvement of the public authorities in the murder of a Venezuelan citizen who was freely exercising his right to demonstrate peacefully.' The regrettable incident was an isolated occurrence which took place after the end of the  May celebrations involving the CTV. It has no political connotations, nor does it entail any violation of, or interference with, freedom of association.
.As regards the CTV s allegations concerning violations of the human rights of workers of the Panamco enterprise in the city of Valencia in the State of Carabobo, the Government states that the Panamco enterprise was indeed raided legally by the National Guard, on the basis of a judicial order, because of the hoarding of foodstuffs. This took place in the context of the illegal  civic work stoppage' which was instigated by the executive committees of the CTV, FEDECAMARAS and opposition political parties and fuelled by various factors in December  and January . The raid was duly justified on the basis of the Consumer and User Protection Act, which states as follows:  Article . Whoever restricts the supply, circulation or distribution of basic or essential goods or services, withholds such articles or prevents the provision of such services, secretly or otherwise, in order to cause shortages and price increases shall be liable to imprisonment of between one and three years and a fine in bolivars equivalent to between , and , days' minimum urban wage-' The articles referred to in the previous paragraph are those defined by decree of the national executive. The products were classified as being essential goods in Decree No.  of  issued by the National Executive. Article  thereof states as follows:  In initiating proceedings for the offences laid down in this Act, the examining body may, if appropriate, order the preventive seizure of the goods concerned by the offence, subject to a prior inventory being made in the presence of a public ministry official. If such goods are perishable or liable to deteriorate, they shall be sold to the public at the price established by the competent authority. Where non?perishable goods are concerned, they shall remain in the custody of the presumed offender. The valuations shall be referred to the court having jurisdiction in the case, together with the proceeds of the sale of the confiscated goods, which shall be deposited in a bank account opened by the court in the name of the presumed offender, blocked and unable to be used until a final ruling on the case has been delivered.' Having complied with the terms of the Act, the National Guard proceeded to implement the order authorizing the raid. During this legal raid it was noted that thousands of litres of juice, water and other soft drinks had been hoarded on the Panamco premises for over a month, since December , as a result of Panamco s participation in the  civic work stoppage'  The non?distribution of the stated products resulted in smuggling and price speculation, with harmful effects for the consumers. It was proven that hoarding had occurred and legal action was taken against this offence, implementation of such action being on the basis of a judicial order issued by a higher agrarian judge who authorized these proceedings in the States of Aragua, Cojedes, Carabobo and Gurico; the judge laid down that the hoarded products could be retained by the competent authorities.
.As regards the alleged assaults of the workers named by the CTV complainants, namely Faustino Villamediana, Jorge Gregorio Flores Gallardo, Jhonathan Magdaleno Rivas, Juan Carlos Zavala and Ramn Daz, the Government points out that since the proceedings have not yet been concluded by the Attorney-General s Office, the latter has not yet replied to the Ministry of Labour.
.The complaint formulated by the CTV states that  the soldiers who carried out the operation acted violently, resulting in serious injury not only to groups of civilians outside the plant but also to a group of workers who were officials of the Beverage Industry Union of the State of Carabobo  ?and goes on to state that,  the victims of the attack were in and around the enterprise premises because they had been collecting outstanding benefit payments. The cause of the scuffles was their protest at the arbitrary conduct of the National Guard and because the confiscation of the goods represented a threat to their jobs' 
.Firstly, the Government would like to make it quite clear to the Committee on Freedom of Association that the National Guard did not act violently in enforcing the measure: the National Guard met the requirements of the law in a peaceful manner. Only minutes after executing the judicial measure the National Guard officers were attacked by various persons unconnected with the enterprise who had been summoned by the television and radio to prevent the National Guard from executing the legal measure to undertake the raid and confiscate the goods hoarded by the operators who participated in the  civic work stoppage'  The CTV is very clear in referring to  groups of civilians outside the plant'  these civilians set about spitting, beating, uttering gross insults, and even trying to seize the security equipment of the National Guard officers assigned to enforce the law. These actions provoked the defensive reaction of the National Guard in order to ensure the physical safety of the officials who were executing the abovementioned judicial order, faced with the aggression of these persons. The claims made seek to establish the unjustified use of force; it actually demonstrates the degree of violence used by certain political opposition groups in Venezuela and the reaction of hatred instilled on a daily basis by the press, radio and television.
.The part of the CTV s complaint which states that  ...and because the confiscation of the goods represented a threat to their",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
237,"jobs' does not sound very convincing: this situation was due to a trade union which was instigating an illegal stoppage making a joint appeal to the employers that the workers should not go to their jobs, claiming that the workers feared that  ...the confiscation of the goods represented a threat to their jobs'  the more so given that the political work stoppage aimed at economic sabotage caused the loss of more than , jobs. The Government deplores the events that occurred, just as it deplores the possible injuries caused to the Panamco workers. It would like to make it clear that it does not condone any type of action which threatens the physical safety of any inhabitant of the Republic. As regards the involvement of the Panamco workers, the National Guard stated that these workers, together with the civilians referred to in the previous paragraph, tried to attack the National Guard officers, which led to the officers in question defending the officials who were implementing the legal measures. The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will be informing the Committee on Freedom of Association in due course of the development of the investigations undertaken by the Attorney-General s Office into the events described above.
.In a communication dated  March  and received on  March, the Government sent its observations on the CTV communication of  February .
.The Committee observes that the allegations in this case concern the following issues: murder of a trade unionist; refusal to register a trade union; hostile statements by the authorities against the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV); detention order against the CTV president; promotion of a parallel confederation by the authorities; obstruction of collective bargaining in the oil industry; detention orders and criminal proceedings against trade union officials; dismissal of more than , workers because of their trade union activities; non-compliance with collective agreements; interference by the authorities and by the Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) enterprise, and anti-union acts; delays in proceedings concerning violations of trade union rights; negotiation with minority public employee organizations in disregard of the most representative ones; and action by the authorities to divide trade unions.Allegations by the ICFTU and the CTV
.With regard to the alleged murder of Mr. Numar Ricardo Herrera, member of the Federation of Construction Workers (FETRACONSTRUCCION), on  May  during a peaceful trade union march, in which other workers were injured, the Committee notes the Government s statements and in particular that:() he was murdered minutes after the end of the  May celebrations as a result of an argument between various people; () during the argument Mr. Manuel Arias fired two shots, killing Mr. Numar Herrera, whereupon he was arrested by the police and brought before the judicial authorities, which issued a detention order; () it was shown that there was no interference by government supporters or the public authorities in the aforementioned murder; () it was an isolated occurrence without political connotations and entailing neither violation of, nor interference in, freedom of association; () the ICFTU s tendency to distort information or perhaps the manipulation to which it was or is exposed must be ironed out. The Committee deeply deplores the murder of the trade unionist Numar Ricardo Herrera, emphasizes that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ] and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to the murder. The Committee requests the Government to indicate clearly whether other workers were injured in the march that took place on  May , as asserted by the ICFTU, and if so, what legal action was taken.
.With respect to the alleged acts of violence by the military on  January  against a group of workers from the Panamco de Venezuela S.A. enterprise, leaders of the Beverage Industry Union of the State of Carabobo, for protesting against the raid on the enterprise and the confiscation of its goods, which represented a threat to their jobs, the Committee notes the Government s claims that; () the raid was authorized by the judicial authority pursuant to the Consumer and User Protection Act, which prohibits any restriction in the supply, circulation or distribution of essential goods; () during the raid it was noted that thousands of litres of juice, water and other soft drinks had been hoarded on the premises of the company, which had taken part in the  civic work stoppage' of December ?January ; () the National Guard officers did not use violence to implement the legal measure but were attacked by various persons unconnected with the enterprise who opposed the raid and confiscation of goods, which prompted the defensive reaction of the forces of law and order; () the Attorney-General s Office has not yet replied (the proceedings not yet being concluded) to the alleged attacks on the workers Faustino Villamediana, Jorge Gregorio Flores Gallardo, Jhonathan Magdaleno Rivas, Juan Carlos Zavala and Ramn Daz. The Committee deplores the acts of violence which occurred during the raid on the Panamco enterprise and urges the Government to institute an independent investigation without delay into the instances of detention and torture claimed by the CTV to have been suffered by these workers and keep the Committee informed on the results.
.As regards the allegation concerning the detention order against Mr. Carlos Ortega, president of the CTV, for the presumed perpetration of political offences during the  national civic work stoppage' ( treason'   incitement to crime' and  criminal damage'  without guarantees of due process in view of a judge s lack of impartiality, and the allegations that the President of the Republic refuses to recognize the CTV leaders, promotes the establishment of a workers' confederation supportive of his party and makes hostile public statements against the CTV and its leaders in the context of the  national civic work stoppage' which began on  December , the Committee notes that the Government has sent its observations, received one day before its meeting. The Committee regrets the delay in the sending of this reply, which it intends to examine at its May-June meeting.Allegations by UNAPETROL
.With respect to the allegation concerning the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register the National Union of Oil, Gas, Petrochemical and Refinery Workers (UNAPETROL) despite the fact that the relevant documentation was submitted on  July , and regarding the Ministry s request to the state enterprise PDVSA to describe the duties performed by the promoters of UNAPETROL, the Committee notes the Government s statements and in particular the Minister of Labour s decision dated  October . The Committee observes that the decision fundamentally objects to the existence of union members who carry out managerial duties and represent both the employers and other categories of workers of PDVSA and its subsidiaries, being contrary to the purity principle and incompatible with mixed unions, with article  of the Organic Labour Act which states that  management employees may not establish workers' unions or become members of them' and with the principle of non-interference laid down in Article  of ILO Convention No. . In addition, according to the decision, the promoters of UNAPETROL were given several opportunities to rectify these deficiencies.
.In the Committee s opinion, the criterion applied by the Minister of Labour does not contradict the principles of Conventions Nos.  and . Nevertheless, the Committee deplores the fact that the Ministry of Labour informed PDVSA of the names of the UNAPETROL members in order to determine who belonged to the management staff and who did not, as well as the fact that the administrative process has been delayed for so many months partly because of a judicial appeal by UNAPETROL but largely owing to delays in administrative proceedings and because it was not clearly stated what specific steps should be taken by UNAPETROL in order to be registered (for example, suggesting that the representative role of the managers be eliminated or, conversely, that that of the non-managers be eliminated). The Committee firmly expects that in future the procedure for trade union registration will be more rapid and more transparent and requests the Government to inform it of the steps it plans to take in this respect and initiate direct contact with the members of UNAPETROL in order to find a solution to the problem of registering the union. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of more than , workers from PDVSA and its subsidiaries, including the members of UNAPETROL, since the start of the  national civic work stoppage' in December , despite the fact that, according to the complainant, the law guarantees the irremovability of members of a trade union in the process of being established (article",0,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
238," of the Organic Labour Act), provides specific guarantees in the event of mass dismissals and provides for the serving of a summons on the employer, and that the collective agreement requires good grounds proven by the judicial authorities and exhaustion of the conciliation process, the Committee notes the Government s statements concerning the historical background to the allegations, namely that: () during  certain sections of the PDVSA senior and middle management paralysed administrative sectors of strategic importance to the oil industry, opposed the company s board of directors ' appointed by the President of the Republic ' on the pretext of ensuring respect for the  meritocracy' and through blackmail promoted staggered partial work stoppages of an illegal and political nature, without respecting legal procedures, these being clear indications of sabotage and political actions; () in April , the President dismissed a number of managers and retired others; just before, a parliamentary committee had been formed to mediate in the dispute; () on  April  these sections of the senior and middle management, the CTV, FEDECAMARAS and sections of the political opposition called for an indefinite general work stoppage and a march on  April, actively participating in the coup d at of  April, which shows the political nature of the actions; () these PDVSA managers were pardoned and no reprisals were taken after the restoration of democracy; the President of the Republic accepted the resignation of the PDVSA board of directors on  April  and the previously dismissed managers formed part of the PDVSA board or its senior and middle management.
.The Committee also notes the Government s statements concerning the specific allegations regarding the dismissal of , workers in the oil industry, in particular to the effect that: () in December  the managers again illegally paralysed the company, this time with claims of revoking the mandate of the Head of State and since October they had collected signatures requesting a consultative referendum to the effect that the President of the Republic should voluntarily relinquish his office (a different scenario from the referendum for revocation of a mandate laid down in the Constitution); in addition, together with the CTV, FEDECAMARAS and other sectors, they issued a call for an indefinite nationwide  civic work stoppage'  this completely paralysed the oil industry but  per cent of the working class did not take part in it; () the PDVSA senior and middle managers then set about sabotaging the industry s operations by disconnecting and closing down computing systems and instructing the remaining workers to return home; they issued calls to paralyse the industry until such time as the dictator departed; () all of this caused a massive crisis of substantial impact with the purpose ' and this was the real aim of the stoppage ' of bringing down the President of the Republic, despite the various initiatives for dialogue and the intervention of the OAS; the cost was US$ billion in losses, together with sabotage, shipping brought to a standstill, plummeting GDP, increasing unemployment and the loss of more than , jobs, apart from daily and contractual workers being prevented from exercising their right to work; () the dismissal of , oil industry workers is the result of their voluntary dereliction of duty for more than  days.
.The Committee notes that the legal grounds for the dismissals were, according to the Government, in the respective cases,  lack of integrity or immoral conduct at work'   unjustified absence from work for three or more working days'   acts of violence'   slander or grave lack of respect and consideration towards the employer'   dereliction of duty'   serious failure to meet employment obligations'  The Committee nevertheless feels compelled to draw attention to the fact that the Government has not made any comments on the alleged failure to observe legal standards and the standards of the collective agreement concerning the dismissal procedure. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this respect.
.While noting the Government s information concerning the events and actions culminating on  and  April , the Committee must focus on the question of the dismissals arising from the  national civic work stoppage' (December -January ) and in particular those of the UNAPETROL members. The Government highlights the illegal character of this stoppage in which the UNAPETROL managers took part and the perpetration of criminal offences, in particular sabotage and acts of coercion, as well as asserting that the real aim was to ensure the departure from office of the President of the Republic. In this respect, the Committee is conscious of the fact that this stoppage was promoted jointly by the CTV, FEDECAMARAS, opposition parties etc., and by the PDVSA managers, and that it was happening in a context of acute political tension and polarization. The Committee emphasizes that it is alleged in the present case that the Government does not recognize the executive committee of the CTV, the most representative trade union confederation, that the CTV and FEDECAMARAS had been protesting against the Government s social and economic policy, and is of the opinion that the  national civic work stoppage' is not unrelated to this protest. The Committee also observes that article  of the Constitution recognizes the right to strike for all workers in the public and private sectors, subject to the conditions laid down by law, and therefore concludes that the right to strike applies to workers in the oil industry. The Committee also observes that the Government refers in general terms to offers of dialogue but does not indicate whether it established contact with the oil industry trade unions and whether it initiated negotiations for establishing a minimum service. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on these offers of dialogue and the corresponding evidence.
.The Committee observes that, contrary to what the Government s reply may suggest, the fact that , dismissals took place perhaps indicates that the work stoppages that occurred could not be attributed exclusively to the PDVSA senior and middle managers.
.Under these circumstances, setting aside the criminal offences referred to by the Government which must be examined and, where appropriate, punished by competent and independent judicial authorities, the Committee considers that the  national civic work stoppage'  convened by the CTV, inter alia, and comprising a set of labour claims, can be likened to a general strike, also directed against the Government s social and economic policy, and therefore the work stoppages in the oil industry may in themselves be regarded as trade union activity. Consequently, the oil industry managers and workers who participated in peaceful work stoppages and did not commit any criminal offences should not have been dismissed. The Committee therefore deplores these mass dismissals, of a hasty and disproportionate nature, which affected , workers, and emphasizes the fact that mass penalties for trade union actions are tantamount to abuses, and destroy labour relations. The Government itself recognizes that it had to back down with respect to the dismissal of , workers soon after the mass dismissals occurred.
.In view of all these elements, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the legal action taken by the dismissed workers and to initiate negotiations with the most representative trade union confederations in order to find a solution to the mass dismissals which took place at PDVSA and its subsidiaries as a consequence of the  national civic work stoppage'  and in particular with regard to the UNAPETROL members, to whom, moreover, article  of the Constitution should be applied, which states that  the promoters and members of the executive committees of trade unions shall enjoy immunity for the duration of, and under the conditions necessary for, the performance of their duties'  The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.With regard to the alleged social consequences of such dismissals (deprivation of the right to medical assistance, of provisions of essential goods, of minors' right to education, no possibility of access to private saving funds, the eviction of hundreds of workers from their dwellings), the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () the dismissed workers' employment relationship ceased immediately and with it the benefits accruing therefrom (housing, schools, savings bank and other benefits); () the evictions respected due process and facilities were made available for more than six months to enable the former workers and their families to relocate, as indeed happened in a very high percentage of cases; () a minority of those dismissed who adopted a political stance were evicted on the basis of judicial orders, the forces of law and order being used where necessary; in isolated cases, the dismissed workers attacked the police or verbally abused the judicial officers; () the children of the former workers who were illegally occupying dwellings were allowed to complete the school year (July ) at the schools belonging",1,2003,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
239,"to, or run by, PDVSA and instructions were given to ensure that henceforth they would be enrolled in state schools; () the social benefits are held in their respective trust funds pending withdrawal of the benefits by the former workers; if the latter failed to make such withdrawals, it is because they voluntarily submitted administrative and judicial appeals for their reinstatement. The Committee must strongly emphasize the serious social consequences of the dismissals, in particular the evictions referred to by UNAPETROL from the housing to which they were entitled under the collective agreement, as well as the fact that the evictions were undertaken even in cases where former workers had appealed against their dismissals. Consequently, the Committee firmly urges the Government to examine together with the trade unions the evictions affecting hundreds of former workers in the State of Falcn and in the San Tom and Anaco oilfields with a view to finding a solution to the problem. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Regarding the alleged anti-union reprisal in the form of PDVSA s written request to its subsidiaries and a Cypriot company not to hire the dismissed workers, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to these allegations. The Committee requests the Government to institute an independent investigation into this matter without delay and, if the allegations are found to be true, ensure that the workers affected are paid appropriate compensation.
.As regards the detention orders of  February  issued against the UNAPETROL president and labour management secretary, Mr. Horacio Medina and Mr. Edgar Quijano, respectively, at the request of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic of Venezuela, by a penal court for presumed acts of sabotage and damage to installations belonging to the PDVSA enterprise (alleged discontinuation of electricity or gas supplies), as well as presumed political offences, and as regards similar actions taken with respect to other UNAPETROL members (Juan Fernandez, Lino Carrillo, Mireya Ripanti de Amaya, Gonzalo Feijoo and Juan Luis Santana, former company directors), the Committee deplores the fact that the Government has not replied specifically to these allegations and urges it to send its observations in this respect as a matter of urgency.
.With respect to the alleged systematic harassment of oil workers by the PDVSA loss prevention and control management and by a new pro-government workers' organization called the Association of Oil Workers (ASOPETROLEROS) (verbal and written threats via e-mail and Intranet; transfers of trained staff for political reasons; persecutions and espionage; arbitrary decisions concerning the structure and functioning of PDVSA and its subsidiaries having a direct effect on the workers), the Committee regrets to observe that the Government has not replied to these allegations and urges it to do so fully and without delay.Allegations by FEDEUNEP
.As regards the alleged obstruction by the labour inspectorate of the draft fourth collective agreement submitted by FEDEUNEP, imposing demands that go beyond the law or are impossible to fulfil in practice within the prescribed deadline and subsequently rejecting the draft, as well as acceptance of a new draft (which was converted into a collective agreement) originating from six of the  FEDEUNEP leaders who formed a federation (FENTRASEP) approved by the government authorities and the Ministry of Labour, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to these allegations and urges it to send its observations without delay.
.As regards the alleged initiation of disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Gustavo Silva, SINTRAFORP general secretary, and Ms. Cecilia Palma, president of the FEDEUNEP disciplinary tribunal, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to these allegations and urges it to do so without delay.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the murder of the trade unionist Numar Ricardo Herrera, member of the Federation of Construction Workers, on  May , emphasizing that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to the murder. The Committee requests the Government to indicate clearly whether other workers were injured in the march that took place on  May , as asserted by the ICFTU, and if so, what legal action was taken.(b) With respect to the alleged acts of violence by the military on  January  against a group of workers from the Panamco de Venezuela S.A. enterprise, leaders of the Beverage Industry Union of the State of Carabobo, for protesting against the raid on the enterprise and the confiscation of its goods, which represented a threat to their jobs, the Committee deplores the acts of violence which occurred during the raid on the Panamco enterprise and urges the Government to institute an independent investigation without delay into the instances of detention and torture claimed by the CTV to have been suffered by workers Faustino Villamediana, Jorge Gregorio Flores Gallardo, Jhonathan Magdaleno Rivas, Juan Carlos Zavala and Ramn Daz. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed of the results.(c) As regards the allegation concerning the detention order against Mr. Carlos Ortega, president of the CTV, for the presumed perpetration of political offences during the  national civic work stoppage' ( treason'   incitement to crime' and  criminal damage'  without the guarantees of due process in view of a judge s lack of impartiality, and the allegations that the President of the Republic refuses to recognize the CTV leaders, promotes the establishment of a workers' confederation supportive of his party and makes hostile public statements against the CTV and its leaders in the context of the  national civic work stoppage' which began on  December , the Committee notes that the Government has sent its observations, received one day before its meeting. The Committee regrets the delay in the sending of that reply, which it intends to examine at its meeting in May-June .Allegations by UNAPETROL(d) With respect to the allegation concerning the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register UNAPETROL despite the fact that the relevant documentation was submitted on  July , and regarding the Ministry s request to the state enterprise PDVSA to describe the duties performed by the promoters of UNAPETROL, the Committee deplores the fact that the Ministry of Labour informed PDVSA of the names of the UNAPETROL members in order to determine who belonged to the management staff and who did not, as well as the fact that the administrative process has been delayed for so many months partly because of a judicial appeal by UNAPETROL but largely owing to delays in administrative proceedings and because it was not clearly stated what specific steps should be taken by UNAPETROL in order to be registered (for example, suggesting that the representative role of the managers be eliminated or, conversely, that that of the non-managers be eliminated). The Committee firmly expects that in future the procedure for trade union registration will be more rapid and more transparent and requests the Government to inform it of the steps it plans to take in this respect and initiate direct contact with the members of UNAPETROL in order to find a solution to the problem of registering the union. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(e) With regard to the alleged dismissal of more than , workers from PDVSA and its subsidiaries, including the members of UNAPETROL, since the start of the  national civic work stoppage' in December , the Committee deplores these mass dismissals, of a hasty and disproportionate nature, which affected , workers, and emphasizes the fact that mass penalties for trade union actions are tantamount to abuses and destroy labour relations.

It requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect and that it send its observations on the alleged failure to observe legal standards and the standards of the collective agreement concerning the dismissal procedure.

241,".At its meeting in March , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee trusts that the deduction of trade union dues of the workers belonging to trade unions that make up the Venezuelan Federation of Teachers (FVM) will be re?established without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation in this regard.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that, applying the agreement of  August  (signed as a result of collective bargaining by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport and the teachers' trade unions, including the FVM), trade union dues are being deducted from teachers and paid to the trade unions that make up the FVM.
.The Committee takes note of this information with interest.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC) dated April .
.The Government sent its reply in a communication dated  September .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated April , the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC) states that since October  the Ministry of Education, in violation of legislation and customary practice, refused to continue with the check-off facility for the trade union dues of teachers affiliated to trade unions grouped under the Venezuelan Federation of Teachers (FVM) who had authorized, in writing, the use of the check-off facility. FLATEC states that the authorities have not replied appropriately to the various notes and communications sent by the FVM with regard to this and emphasizes that the FVM is undergoing great economic difficulties as a result of this behaviour, which is obstructing and changing its programme of action.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is committed to achieving full effect for all human rights, especially those relating to labour and trade unions. It also states that the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela expressly recognizes those fundamental rights and grants supraconstitutional ranking to international human rights treaties, among them the International Labour Organization Conventions. It also indicates that currently the State is going through an adaptation process for all its legislation and institutions in order to adapt them to the contents of the new Political Constitution and the international commitments of the Republic, in order to ensure the full enjoyment and exercise of human rights for all.
.Specifically, with regard to the allegations in this complaint, the Government states that the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport suspended the check-off facility for ordinary trade union dues of the teachers in its service in . This decision was based on the fact that, at that time, there were serious complaints and many simultaneous indications of irregularities in the use of the check-off facility for ordinary and extraordinary trade union dues, which seriously violated the human rights of a large number of teachers in its service. These irregularities included, among others, use of the check-off facility for trade union dues of teachers who were not affiliated to any trade union organization, trade union dues deducted from teachers who had given up their membership to trade union organizations, trade union dues deducted from teachers who had not complied with the requirements laid down in law and in the statutes of the trade union organizations, and double or triple trade union dues deducted from teachers for first-level trade union organizations of the same employer.
.The Government adds that the irregularities in the use of the check-off facility for trade union dues had been in existence for more than  years in the country and had been the subject of various and continuing complaints by workers and various trade union organizations, who had repeatedly asked the Government to resolve the situation in order to protect the right to a wage, protection of that wage and freedom of association, in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Wages Convention,  (No. ), the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Constitution and national legislation. This was also why article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela stated expressly that workers had the right  not to join' trade union organizations.
.The Government states that the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport, in order to ensure the human rights of the teachers in its service, in strict accordance with the mandate of the new Constitution and the international treaties on human rights, proceeded to adopt a series of measures aimed at correcting the irregularities in the use of the check-off facility for trade union dues. It was necessary to adopt immediate measures to safeguard the enjoyment and exercise of the various human rights that in practice were being infringed, i.e. the right of teachers to a wage, the protection of wages and freedom of association, which were affected by the wrongful use of the check-off facility for trade union dues. These measures necessarily involved the temporary suspension, for the time that was strictly necessary and as short as possible, of the use of the check-off facility for trade union dues, while the appropriate adjustments were being made. In order to manage this successfully and rapidly, the cooperation and support of the first, second and third-level trade union organizations of teachers in the service of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport was essential, as it was impossible to resolve the issue without reliable, first-hand and trustworthy information on trade union members and on the fulfilment of the prerequisites laid down in legislation and in the statutes to carry out deduction of trade union dues.
.The Government states that, unfortunately, conditions were not favourable to direct, transparent and rapidly held dialogue between the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport and the trade union organizations, aimed at resolving the irregularities in the use of the check-off facility for trade union dues. This period was marked by the holding of a trade union referendum and a series of democratic elections to elect the holders of positions for popular representation, the elections for re-recognition of trade union organizations, conspiracies against the national Government and the reprehensible coup on  April , for which reports have been made with regard to the participation of high-level trade union officials of the executive committee of the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers, including an official of the Trade Union Leadership Committee (temporary), who was appointed Minister for Planning during the coup.
.The Government adds that during this time the regularization of the use of the check-off facility for trade union dues was the subject of voluntary collective bargaining in the framework of a list of demands of a conciliatory nature, presented before the Inspectorate of National and Collective Labour Affairs for the Public Sector of the Ministry of Labour on  October , by the teachers' trade union organizations against the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport. During the procedure of voluntary negotiations, the rhythm and speed of which was marked by the socio-political circumstances of the country and of the trade union organizations, conditions were gradually created to correct the irregularities in the use of the check-off facility for trade union dues, in order to ensure the right to a wage, the protection of wages and freedom of association for teachers. On  August , an Agreement was signed between the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport and the teachers' trade unions, including the FVM, in which the conditions to re-establish the use of the check-off facility were agreed upon, and this stated:  Clause No. , use of the check-off facility for trade union dues. The deduction of trade union dues will be re-established once discussion and conclusion of the current list of demands has taken place, the re-establishment of the deduction of trade union dues will be made with the lists presented to the National Electoral Council, as registry of the electoral roll for the elections that were held on  November , and recorded in the Directorate for Labour and Trade Union Relations and copied to the pay system of the payroll unit.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:

.The Committee notes that the complainant organization states that the Ministry of Education decided to suspend, from October , the deduction of the trade union dues of workers affiliated to the trade unions grouped under the Venezuelan Federation of Teachers (FVM), causing the latter serious economic hardship.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement with regard to the allegations that: (i) this decision was based on the fact that at the time there were serious complaints and many simultaneous indications",0,2002,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
242,"of irregularities in the deduction of ordinary and extraordinary trade union dues which, according to the Government, seriously violated the human rights of a large number of teachers in its service.

The deduction of trade union dues will be re-established once discussion and conclusion of the current list of demands has been carried out, the re-establishment of the deduction of trade union dues will be made with the lists presented to the National Electoral Council, as registry of the electoral roll for the elections that were held on  November , and recorded in the Directorate for Labour and Trade Union Relations and copied to the pay system of the payroll unit.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In this respect, the Committee notes with concern that, although the Government states that there were  serious complaints' and indications of irregularities with regard to the deduction of trade union dues that involved the temporary suspension of their deduction, it provides no information on any independent investigation, for example, by the legal authorities. Nevertheless, the Committee emphasizes that the Government did not provide any evidence of complaints emanating from the FVM. Moreover, the Committee notes that the suspension of deductions has now been in place for more than two years. The Committee requests the Government that, in future, when allegations of irregularities in the deduction of trade union dues arise, the case is submitted to an impartial independent body for investigation of the matter and that deduction of trade union dues is only suspended for those workers who have lodged complaints.
.The Committee recalls that on numerous occasions it has emphasized that  the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. Therefore, the Committee considers that the decision of the Ministry of Education to suspend the deduction of trade union dues for members of trade unions belonging to the FVM is a violation of the rights of the FVM that has seriously affected its financing. In these circumstances, the Committee notes that in August , the parties to the conflict signed an Agreement before the administrative authorities in which it was stated that the deduction of trade union dues would be re-established once discussion of the list of demands had been completed. The Committee trusts that the deduction of the trade union dues in question will be re-established without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While considering that the Ministry of Education s decision to suspend the deduction of the trade union dues of members of trade unions making up the Venezuelan Federation of Teachers (FVM), more than two years ago, constitutes a violation of the rights of that organization, and that this has seriously affected the financing of the organization, the Committee requests the Government that, in future, when allegations of irregularities in the deduction of trade union dues arise, the case is submitted to an impartial independent body for investigation of the matter and that deduction of trade union dues is only suspended for those workers who have lodged a complaint.(b) The Committee trusts that the deduction of trade union dues of the workers belonging to trade unions that make up the FVM will be re-established without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation in this regard.",1,2002,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
243,".At its November  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to inform it of all measures adopted to reinstate trade union officials Jos Gregorio Gonzlez, Delvis Beomont and Sonia Chacn, who had been dismissed from the  Sofa Imbert' Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas, as well as about a draft law to amend labour legislation, in particular with regard to protection against anti-union discrimination, which had been submitted to the Congress of the Republic [see nd Report, paras. -].
.In a communication dated  January , the Government states with reference to the situation of the former officials Jos Gregorio Gonzlez, Delvis Beomont and Sonia Chacn, that they left their posts in . These former officials voluntarily stopped working for the MACCSI, and consequently abandoned the proceedings initiated before the Labour Inspectorate where they were requesting reinstatement and the payment of outstanding wages, which is why the Labour Inspectorate did not order them. The Government also states that these former workers were paid all the benefits and other obligations to which they were entitled under their employment contracts, in keeping with the Republic s Constitution and legislation.
.With regard to the draft law to amend labour legislation, and in particular with regard to protection against anti-union discrimination, the Government states that it put the draft law to reform the Labour Organization Act before the National Assembly, and it was approved in first discussion on  June , while the second discussion process involving the consultation and participation of all the social partners, is under way. According to the Government, this draft law is underpinned by the recommendations formulated by the ILO supervisory bodies relating to the need to adapt national provisions to the obligations deriving from the ratification and application of Conventions Nos.  and . The draft law incorporates means of protection for workers against acts of anti-union discrimination and imposes strict sanctions on anyone violating these rights; more rapid, less rigid and more effective justice is guaranteed. The draft also restores the system of compensation for unjustified dismissal, protecting workers discriminated by the last reform of the Labour Organization Act of . Mass dismissals are regulated more precisely, as are other issues.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the Act as soon as it is adopted.
.At its June  meeting, the Committee noted the measures adopted by the Government with a view to implementing its recommendations regarding the reinstatement of dismissed SUTRAMACCSI officials, and requested the Government to continue to take steps to ensure that the  Sofia Imbert' Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas reinstated them in their posts. The Committee also noted in this connection that the authorities had proposed amendments to legislation relating to anti-union discrimination, and would be requesting the ILO s technical assistance. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of developments with regard to the dismissed individuals and to legislation, and hoped that these matters would soon be satisfactorily resolved [see st Report, para. ]. The dismissed officials referred to are Jorge Moreno (Secretary-General), Jos Gregorio Gonzlez (Secretary), Delvis Beomont (Treasurer), Alfonso Perdomo (Public Relations Officer) and Omar Burgos (Secretary for Labour and Complaints) and Teresa Zottola and Sonia Chacn.
.In its communications of  and  June , the Government states that Teresa Zottola, Jorge Moreno, Omar Burgos and Alfonso Perdomo have been reinstated in accordance with administrative rulings that also regulate back payment of wages.
.The Committee notes this information with satisfaction. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of all measures adopted to reinstate trade union officials Jos Gregorio Gonzlez and Delvis Beomont and Sonia Chacn. The Committee has also been informed that a draft law to amend the labour legislation, in particular with regard to protection against anti-union discrimination, has been submitted to the Congress of the Republic. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.At its meeting in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on questions that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:' The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures (including sanctions) to ensure the reinstatement of the trade union officials who remain dismissed by the Foundation of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas and the payment of the wages owing to them. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.[In its communication of  September , the complainant organization had indicated that the Foundation of the Museum of Contemporary Arts in Caracas, without the prior authorization of the Labour Inspectorate required by law, had dismissed trade union officials Jorge Moreno (Secretary-General), Jos Gregorio Gonzlez (Secretary), Delvis Beomont (Treasurer), Alfonso Perdomo (Public Relations Officer) and Omar Burgos (Secretary for Labour and Complaints [see th Report, para. ]. At its meeting in July , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:  As regards the dismissal of the trade union leaders Teresa Zottola and Sonia Chacn, the Committee urges the Government to investigate promptly and impartially these dismissals and, if their anti-union nature is established, to take the necessary measures without delay to reinstate the trade union officials in question in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.

The Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO at its disposal in relation to the issue of slowness of the pending proceedings concerning anti-union dismissals and other acts of anti-union discrimination.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that the Labour Administration shares the concerns of the Committee on Freedom of Association with regard to the urgent need for legislative reforms to speed up rulings protecting workers from anti-union discrimination. In the light of this, the Executive, together with the National Assembly s Commission for Social Development, has proposed certain legislative amendments, of which the ILO will be informed in good time so that it may provide the necessary technical assistance. The Government also indicates that, in accordance with the recommendation made by the Committee on Freedom of Association, it will initiate a process of social dialogue aimed at evaluating these measures, the results thereof and the financial resources needed to provide the Labour Administration with the personnel and infrastructure that will allow more effective application of legislation.
.As regards the situation of members of SUTRAMACCSI affected by anti-union discrimination, the Government states that it is continuing to move ahead with measures intended to bring about the reinstatement of the trade union officials by the employers, that it has imposed financial penalties and is considering claims made by employees in connection with the employer s failure to meet its obligations. Similarly, it has indicated that the Deputy Minister for Culture has been replaced for, among other reasons, disregarding instructions from the Labour Administration to reinstate the union officials affected by anti-union measures.
.The Committee notes the measures adopted by the Government with a view to implementing its recommendations regarding the reinstatement of dismissed SUTRAMACCSI officials, and requests the Government to continue to take steps to ensure that the  Sofa Imbert' Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas reinstates them in their posts. The Committee also notes in this connection that the authorities have proposed amendments to legislation relating to anti-union discrimination, and will be requesting the ILO s technical assistance. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments with regard to the dismissed individuals and to legislation, and hopes that these matters will soon be satisfactorily resolved.
.The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The complainant organization, the Single Trade Union of Workers of the  Sofia Imbert' Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas (SUTRAMACCSI), sent new allegations in a communication dated  September .
.The Government sent further observations in a communication dated  November .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the dismissal of five trade union officials by the Foundation of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas ( Sofia Imbert' (SUTRAMACCSI)), the Committee notes with concern that, according to the complainant organization and the Government, this Foundation continues in its refusal to comply with the administrative ruling of the Labour Inspectorate, dated  September , ordering the reinstatement of those trade union officials dismissed with payment of back wages. The Committee welcomes the issuing of the aforementioned administrative ruling and welcomes the fact that the Labour Inspectorate imposed a fine equivalent to US$ on the Foundation on  November . However, the Committee regrets that the administrative decisions were only made in September and November , while the dismissals date from ",0,2001,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
244,"December , with the result that, as noted by the Government, three of the five trade union officials dismissed have decided to renounce their claims. The Committee notes that the Government shares the need for more rapid procedures and requests it to take the appropriate legislative or other steps in order to speed up proceedings relating to anti-union discrimination. In this respect, the Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is at its disposal. The Committee requests the Government to continue to take the necessary measures (including sanctions) to ensure the reinstatement of the trade union officials who remain dismissed and the payment of their outstanding wages, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.With regard to the allegation concerning connivance between the Labour Inspectorate and the Foundation to create a parallel trade union, the Committee notes with interest the Government s statements according to which: () the Minister ordered the removal of the labour inspectors who had committed irregularities; and () the new inspectors ordered that the files of the collective bargaining procedure with the parallel trade union in order to sign a collective agreement without the workers' knowledge be closed.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures (including sanctions) to ensure the reinstatement of the trade union officials who remain dismissed by the Foundation of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas and the payment of the wages owing to them. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary legislative or other steps to speed up the procedures relating to anti-union discrimination.(c) The Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is at its disposal in relation to the issue of slowness of the pending proceedings concerning anti-union dismissals and other acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  November  from the Single Trade Union of Workers of the ""Sofa Imbert"" Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas (SUTRAMACCSI). The complaint has been supported by the following organizations: the National Trade Union of Public Employees of the Autonomous Institute of the National Library and Library Services (SBN), the Single Trade Union of Workers of the Teresa Carreo Foundation (SUTRAFUNTECA) and the Association of Workers of the Museum of Sciences of the Capital District (SINTRAMUCIEN).
.The Government replied in a communication dated  January .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , the Single Trade Union of Workers of the ""Sofa Imbert"" Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas (SUTRAMACCSI) states that on  August , it deposited with the Ministry of Labour the documents required by law for the registration of the union, and that on  August the Labour Inspectorate drew attention to formal defects or errors that needed to be rectified, which was in fact done on  September .
.The complainant adds that on  October , the employer, i.e. the (public) Foundation of the Museum of Contemporary Art, appealed to the Ministry of Labour to cancel the registration, alleging in general and unsubstantiated terms that trade union leaders had the status of ""management employees""; on  October, a labour inspector was presented with the union s evidence that its General Secretary (the only official questioned by the employer) did not have that status.
.On  October , it was noted that the page numbering in the registration file had been altered from page  onwards and documents which purported to have a bearing on the status of workers in the union s general secretariat and public relations office had been unduly inserted in the file.
.On  November , the time allowed for registration elapsed and the legal protection against anti-union discrimination which had hitherto been enjoyed by the trade union s founders expired; on  November, Ms. Sonia Chacn, the union s Public Relations Secretary, who also enjoyed special maternity protection as she had recently had a child, was arbitrarily dismissed.
.One of the unions that supported this complaint (SUTRFUNTECA) states that Ms. Teresa Zottola, General Secretary of SUTRAMACCSI, was also dismissed on  November , and that the Labour Inspectorate, working closely with the Foundation of the Museum of Contemporary Art, has been pushing ahead with the foundation of a parallel union, promoted by the Director of Human Resources. The trade unions that support the complaint by SUTRAMACCSI stress that the refusal to register this organization is linked to the fact that five cultural trade unions are needed to form a federation, and that figure would be reached with the registration of SUTRAMACCSI.
.In its communication of  January , the Government supplies the registration certificate with which the labour inspector of Libertador Municipality in the Capital District certifies that the Single Trade Union of Workers of the ""Sofa Imbert"" Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas (SUTRAMACCSI) complied with all the requisite procedures to obtain legal registration, in accordance with section , Title VII of the Organic Labour Act. It was accordingly granted legal certification and entered in the appropriate registry under No. , heading , Vol. III, dated  December .
.The Government emphasizes that the union was registered once all the legal requirements were met, since it is in the interests of the Government, as represented by the Ministry of Labour, to facilitate the active participation of all trade union organizations, as the law requires.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant and the organizations supporting the complaint have alleged the following: () the refusal of the authorities to register the complainant organization (SUTRAMACCSI); () the dismissal of the General Secretary and Public Relations Secretary of SUTRAMACCSI; and () connivance between the Labour Inspectorate and the (public) Foundation of the Museum of Contemporary Art to create a parallel union, promoted by the Director of Human Resources.
.As regards the first allegation, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government, according to which SUTRAMACCSI was registered on  December . Given that the Government has not explained the reasons for the delay in granting registration, the Committee cannot but regret that the union was obliged to wait several months before obtaining registration, despite having rectified the formal deficiencies noted by the authorities, and urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future, registration of trade unions is not unjustifiably delayed.
.As regards the dismissal of Teresa Zottola and Sonia Chacn, General Secretary and Public Relations Secretary respectively of SUTRAMACCSI, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegation in question. The Committee notes that according to the allegations, documents purporting to show that the trade union officials concerned did not in fact have the status of workers were improperly inserted in the registration file; according to the allegations, the foundation challenged the General Secretary s right to hold that post before the authorities. The Committee notes that, according to the allegations, the dismissals in question occurred as the legal protection against anti-union discrimination which had been enjoyed by the trade union s founders was coming to an end.
.The Committee draws the Government s attention to the principle according to which ""No person shall be prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ], and to the principle that ""The dismissal of workers on grounds of membership of an organization or trade union activities violates the principles of freedom of association"" [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee emphasizes that protection against dismissals of this type is especially desirable in the case of trade union officials to allow them to perform their trade union duties with the necessary independence, without being prejudiced on that account, and to ensure respect for the right of workers to elect their representatives freely. Under these circumstances, bearing in mind the fact that the Government has not denied the information supplied by the complainant, the Committee considers the possibility that the dismissal of the trade union officials Teresa Zottola and Sonia Chacn was motivated by their trade union membership and activities; it urges the Government to investigate promptly and impartially these dismissals and, if their anti-union nature is established, to take the necessary measures to ensure that the trade union officials in question are reinstated in their posts without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.Lastly, as regards the allegation concerning connivance between the Labour Inspectorate and the (public) Foundation of the Museum of Contemporary Art to establish a parallel trade union promoted by the Director of Human Resources, the Committee greatly regrets that the Government has not replied to this allegation",1,2001,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
245,"and urges it to supply its observations as a matter of urgency. The Committee draws the Government s attention to Article  of Convention No. , according to which:
.Workers' and employers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other s agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration.
.In particular, acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference within the meaning of this Article.The Committee requests the Government to guarantee the effective implementation of these principles in practice.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets that the complainant organization has had to wait several months to obtain registration, and urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future, registration of trade unions is not unjustifiably delayed.(b) As regards the dismissal of the trade union leaders Teresa Zottola and Sonia Chacn, the Committee urges the Government to investigate promptly and impartially these dismissals and, if their anti-union nature is established, to take the necessary measures without delay to reinstate the trade union officials in question in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) As regards the allegation concerning connivance between the Labour Inspectorate and the (public) Foundation of the Museum of Contemporary Art to establish a parallel trade union promoted by the Director of Human Resources, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegation and urges it to send its observations as a matter of urgency. The Committee requests the Government to ensure the effective implementation of Article  of Convention No. , concerning protection against acts of anti-union interference.",1,2001,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
246,".In its previous examination of this case, in March , the Committee reiterated its request to the Government to send the text of the rulings relating to the dismissal of three trade union members who had initiated legal proceedings (Mr Otiel Montero, Mr Guido Siviria and Mr Orlando Acua). The Committee deeply regretted that, despite the fact that the allegations dated from , it still did not know whether or not rulings on those dismissals had been handed down, and once again drew the Government s attention to the fact that justice delayed is justice denied [see rd Report, para. ].
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that the complaint presented by a group of workers from Corporacin INLACA enterprise, who were promoting the establishment of the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium, refers to alleged violations of freedom of association by the State. With regard to Mr Otiel Montero, the Government states that it indicated in a communication dated  November  that he did not provide services for Corporacin INLACA enterprise and does not play an active part in any document or in the legal proceedings that have been launched in this case. The appeal lodged by Mr Guido Siviria and Mr Orlando Acua against administrative decision No. - is being examined. The Government states that the progress and results of this appeal will be communicated to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee once again notes with deep regret the delayed justice, given that the allegations date from . The Committee draws the Government s attention to the principle that cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.  should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be truly effective; excessive delays in processing cases of antiunion discrimination and, in particular, a lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by the enterprise, constitute a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ].
.The Committee awaits communication from the Government of the rulings relating to the dismissal of the trade union members Mr Guido Siviria and Mr Orlando Acua, and expects that they will be handed down without delay.
.In its previous examination of the case in November , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee once again requests the Government to indicate whether trade unionist Mr Otiel Montero has initiated legal action in connection with his dismissal. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations in which it stressed that the allegations date back to  and that justice delayed is justice denied. The Committee firmly trusts once more that the judicial authorities will hand down their ruling on the dismissal of the trade unionists, Mr Guido Siviria and Mr Orlando Acua, in the very near future and requests the Government to communicate the ruling as soon as it is handed down.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium of the INLACA Corporation (of which these trade unionists were members) submitted a list of members which did not contain the minimum number of  members' names required to form an association, and that the labour inspection authority set a deadline of  days to remedy that situation and refused to register the union for failing to do so.
.The Committee wishes to recall that the questions which remained pending concern not the registration of the union but the dismissal of three trade union members, who had initiated legal proceedings against dismissal (Otiel Montero, Guido Siviria and Orlando Acua). The Committee reiterates its request to the Government to send the text of the relevant rulings. The Committee greatly regrets that, despite the fact that the allegations date from , it still does not know whether or not rulings on those dismissals have been handed down, and once again draws the Government s attention to the fact that justice delayed is justice denied.
.At its meeting in June , the Committee requested the Government to communicate the ruling handed down with respect to the dismissal of trade unionists Mr Guido Siviria and Mr Orlando Acua, and to indicate whether the trade unionist Mr Otiel Montero had initiated legal action in connection with his dismissal (these persons had been dismissed for establishing the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium and had been working in the INLACA Corporation) [see th Report, para. ]. The Committee recalled that the allegations date back to  and stressed that justice delayed is justice denied. The Committee trusts that the judicial authorities will hand down their ruling in the near future [see nd Report, para. ].
.In its communications dated  and  May , the Government states that, on  September , the workers, Mr Guido Siviria and Mr Orlando Acua, requested that a ruling be handed down on the substance of the case. As the case is currently being heard at the last instance, the Government will provide information on the judicial decision.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee once again requests the Government to indicate whether trade unionist Mr Otiel Montero has initiated legal action in connection with his dismissal. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations in which it stressed that the allegations date back to  and that justice delayed is justice denied. The Committee firmly trusts once more that the judicial authorities will hand down their ruling on the dismissal of the trade unionists Mr Guido Siviria and Mr Orlando Acua in the very near future and requests the Government to communicate the ruling as soon as it is handed down.
.At its meeting in March , the Committee requested the Government to communicate the details of the rulings handed down with respect to the dismissal of trade unionists Siviria and Acua, and to indicate whether the trade unionist Montero had initiated legal action in connection with his dismissal (these persons had been dismissed for establishing the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium and had been working in the INLACA Corporation) [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication dated  January , the Government merely reiterated its earlier statements.
.The Committee asks the Government to communicate to it the information and rulings it requested in its previous examination of the case. The Committee recalls that the allegations date back to  and stresses that justice delayed is justice denied [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee trusts that the judicial authorities will hand down their ruling in the very near future.
.At its meeting in June , the Committee requested the Government to indicate whether the trade unionists Messrs. Amaro, Aular, Sivira, Montero and Acua remained dismissed for their participation in the establishment of a trade union [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that the workers Amaro and Aular withdrew their claim before the Supreme Court of Justice (Political/Administrative Chamber). As regards Sivira and Acua, they applied to the judge on  June  to continue examination of the case. Mr. Montero no longer works for the INLACA corporation.
.The Committee takes note of this information. It notes that the trade unionists Amaro and Aular withdrew the legal action which they had filed following their dismissal, and that the trade unionists Sivira and Acua asked the court to continue examination of the case concerning their dismissal. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the details of any ruling handed down. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the trade unionist Montero has initiated legal action in connection with his dismissal.
.At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to transmit the judgement concerning the denial of registration of the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium, and requested the complainant trade union to indicate whether the following trade unionists remained dismissed: Jorge Amaro, Alfredo Aular, Guido Sivira, Otiel Montero and Orlando Acua [see rd Report, para. ].
.In its communications of  October  and  March , the Government attaches a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice (Political/Administrative Chamber) which acknowledges that the four individuals who had requested the cancellation of the administrative decision (concerning the denial of registration of the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium) had withdrawn their claim.
.The Committee notes this information and requests once again the complainant trade union to indicate whether the following trade unionists remain dismissed, for having participated in the establishment of the trade union: Jorge Amaro, Alfredo Aular, Guido Sivira, Otiel Montero and Orlando Acua.
.At its March  meeting, the Committee formulated the following recommendations on the issues that were",1,2001,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
247,"still pending [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government to supply a copy of any court ruling regarding the refusal to register the complainant (Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium). At the same time, the Committee deplores the fact that the Government has not supplied any information in connection with its recommendation concerning the reinstatement of all the workers who were dismissed for participating in the establishment of the union in question, and urges the Government to take measures without delay to ensure that these workers are reinstated in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour will comply with the ruling handed down by the judicial authority relating to the administrative decision refusing to register the trade union in question. Furthermore, the Government attaches the financial agreements concluded between six workers (Jonatn Pacheco, Ivn Orlando Surez, Jaime Gmez, Daniel Len, Alcides A. Hernndez and Gerardo Montenegro) and the INLACA corporation in which they freely recognize that those agreements should be considered as res judicata and renounce any proceedings.
.The Committee notes this information. It requests the Government to send it the ruling handed down concerning the refusal to register the complainant trade union. The Committee notes the agreements signed by six dismissed workers and requests the complainant trade union to indicate whether other workers remain dismissed for having participated in the establishment of the trade union (the complainant organization had also referred in its communication of  December  to Jorge Amaro, Alfredo Aular, Guido Sivira, Otiel Montero and Orlando Acua).
.At its June  meeting, the Committee urged the Government  to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that: (a) the trade union of the Corporacin INLACA enterprise, called the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium, is registered; and (b) all of the workers of the enterprise who were dismissed for having participated in the establishment and application for registration of the trade union in question are reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in these respects' [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that the trade union founders opted for a category of trade union ( enterprise union'  which could not legally include workers who were not working for the same employer. The Government states that the new union has initiated a legal challenge to the decision of the Ministry of Labour not to register it, and adds that it invites the founders to choose a different category of trade union.
.The Committee notes the Government s information and requests the Government to supply a copy of any court ruling regarding the refusal to register the complainant. At the same time, the Committee deplores the fact that the Government has not supplied any information in connection with its recommendation concerning the reinstatement of all the workers who were dismissed for participating in the establishment of the union in question, and urges the Government to take measures without delay to ensure that these workers are reinstated in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium dated  October . The complainant presented additional information in a communication dated  December . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  October  and  January , the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium alleges that in February  a group of workers decided to establish a trade union in the Corporacin INLACA enterprise, but were dismissed and reinstated after proceedings which lasted seven months.
.The complainant adds that on  September  an application was filed for registration of a new trade union with the Valencia Inspectorate in the State of Carabobo, and that on ,  September and  October  the Corporacin INLACA enterprise dismissed the executive committee of the trade union and some workers who supported its establishment. The complainant points out that on  December  the Guacara Inspectorate stated that in order to register the trade union the signatures would have to be verified, which was carried out; despite this, on  January  the same Labour Inspectorate refused to register the trade union.
.The complainant adds that on  December , the Labour Inspectorate ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed workers. On  January  the workers were reinstated, paid part of their wage arrears, and again dismissed.
.Lastly, the complainant states that: (i) on  January  an application was submitted to register a new trade union (the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium) in the Corporacin INLACA enterprise; (ii) on  May  the Labour Inspectorate refused the application for registration on the grounds that the founders of the trade union were not employees of the Corporacin INLACA enterprise; (iii) an administrative appeal (recurso jerrquico) was filed with the Ministry of Labour on  June  and dismissed on  September; and (iv) on  October , the Labour Inspectorate of Puerto Cabello, Carabobo State, denied the petition for reinstatement of the dismissed workers, on the grounds that there was a doctrinal rule providing that trade union immunity of union officers could not exceed three months.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government states that, having studied the documents in the possession of the Labour Inspectorate of the Autonomous Municipalities of Valencia, Naguanagua, San Diego, Los Guayos, Carlos Arvelo, Miranda and Montalbn of the State of Carabobo and the Inspectorate s decision handed down on  May , the Ministry of Labour upheld the decision, on the grounds that pursuant to divisions II and III of Chapter II of Title VII of the Organic Labour Act, the workers wishing to establish the trade union did not meet the most elementary requirements, such as that of being employed by the enterprise, especially if it is an enterprise union that they intended to establish (section  of the Organic Labour Act). The Government states that as at  January , the date on which the supporting documents were to be presented (notification of the general meeting, constitution, list of members and by-laws), the workers who were applying for the establishment of the trade union did not have the required status of employees of the enterprise in which they were organizing the trade union. The Government adds that neither the constitution of the trade union nor the list of members bore the signatures of the members of the executive committee.
.The Government states that article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela provides for the right of workers to establish freely such trade unions as they consider appropriate, and that the Organic Labour Act elaborates on this right, laying down the requirements to be met by the persons concerned. However, the procedure for establishing a trade union does not implicitly include a procedure for reinstatement and payment of wage arrears, which is another administrative procedure in labour law, for which provision is made in sections  and  of the Organic Labour Act. This procedure was not initiated by the trade union s founders once they had lost the required status of employees of the enterprise and applied for registration of their planned trade union. The Government adds that according to the documents of the case, on  January  the founders of the trade union petitioned the competent Labour Inspectorate for reinstatement and payment of their wage arrears. A favourable decision would result in the persons concerned being reinstated, and in the event of an unfavourable decision they could even avail themselves of the appropriate legal channels (by filing an appeal for annulment). Should they obtain the status of employees of the Corporacin INLACA enterprise and meet the requirements laid down in the law in this respect, they will have every right to apply again for the establishment of their trade union, given that the labour legislation does not lay down any condition as to the timing of applying for registration of the trade union, which would thus become lawfully registered. Lastly, the Government announces its intention to remain attentive to the reinstatement proceedings, which are still under way, in order to inform the Committee of progress in this case and the proper application of the laws and regulations in force.
.The Committee observes that the complainant alleges that on three occasions (February and September  and January ) an attempt was made to establish a trade union in the Corporacin INLACA enterprise but its registration was refused and, on all three occasions, its founding members were dismissed.
.The Committee observes",1,2001,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
248,"that the Government refers in its reply to the third procedure involving the application for registration of the trade union and that it states that: () the decision to refuse registration of the trade union was based on the fact that the workers attempting to establish it did not have the required status of employees of the enterprise at the time the application was made; () the founders of the trade union petitioned the competent Labour Inspectorate for reinstatement on  January  and a favourable decision by the administrative authority would enable them, as workers, to establish a trade union and apply for its registration; and () it will remain attentive to the reinstatement proceedings -- which are still under way -- of the dismissed founders of the trade union, in order to keep it informed of progress in this case.
.The Committee emphasizes ""the importance that it attaches to the fact that workers and employers should in practice be able to establish and join organizations of their own choosing in full freedom"" and recalls that it has pointed out on numerous occasions that ""if the conditions for the granting of registration are tantamount to obtaining previous authorization from the public authorities for the establishment or functioning of a trade union, this would undeniably constitute an infringement of Convention No. "" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ]. Moreover, the Committee points out that ""measures taken against workers because they attempt to constitute organizations or to reconstitute organizations of workers outside the official organization would be incompatible with the principle that workers should have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing without previous authorization"" and that ""the necessary measures have to be taken so that trade unionists who have been dismissed for activities related to the establishment of a union are reinstated in their functions, if they so wish"" [see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ].
.The Committee observes that the Government has not denied in its reply the alleged attempts to obtain registration of the trade union prior to January , nor the dismissals of its founders on those occasions. Moreover, the Committee regrets that, although more than  months have elapsed since the beginning of the proceedings, the Government merely states that ""it will remain attentive"" to the proceedings for reinstatement of the founding members of the trade union who were dismissed. In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that there have been serious violations of freedom of association and therefore urges the Government to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that: (a) the trade union of the Corporacin INLACA enterprise, called the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium, is registered; and (b) all of the workers of the enterprise who were dismissed for having participated in the establishment and application for registration of the trade union in question are reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that: (a) the trade union of the Corporacin INLACA enterprise, called the Trade Union of Revolutionary Workers of the New Millennium, is registered; and (b) all of the workers of the enterprise who were dismissed for having participated in the establishment and application for registration of the trade union in question are reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in these respects.",1,2001,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
249,".At its June  meeting, the Committee formulated the following recommendations on the issues that remained outstanding [see st Report, para. ]:' With respect to the mass dismissals of workers in the State of Trujillo, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that all workers who were dismissed in violation of the collective agreement be reinstated in their posts and if that is not possible that they receive adequate entitlements. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.' The Committee again urges the Government to indicate whether it has executed the six judicial rulings on labour stability mentioned in the criminal complaint submitted to the Public Prosecutor s Office on  July  against the authorities of the Trujillo Health Foundation (FUNDASALUD) and the latter s decision in the matter and to inform it of the result of the court proceedings in respect of the order of the Inspectorate of Labour to reinstate the workers of the former Department of State Public Works (now the Department of Infrastructure).
.In its communication dated  October , the Government sent official documentation showing that the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court ordered that the judgements of first instance ordering the reinstatement of six workers should be vacated due to violation of due process; the social benefits of these workers had previously been paid. The Government stresses that the Executive Power of the State of Trujillo, by reason of the restructuring (new administrative organization) that resulted in the mass dismissals, settled all its labour obligations, and the workers who fulfilled the necessary requirements were even awarded pension benefits.
.The Committee notes this information.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras. -], approved by the Governing Body at its November  meeting.
.The Government sent its partial observations in a communication dated  January .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the present case refers to the mass dismissal of workers (, according to the complainants, , according to the Government) in the context of a reorganization of various departments of the public administration in the regional government of the State of Trujillo. With respect to the Committee s request for an explanation of the reasons for the measure, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, the administrative reorganization was driven by the need for an efficient rationalization of the state s resources, in order to improve the situation of various population groups of Trujillo who were in a profound state of crisis and was based on provisions of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Constitution of the State of Trujillo and the State of Trujillo Political Regime Act. The Committee also observes that according to the Government, a total of , workers had accepted and received settlement of their entitlements and only seven cases remained to be settled.
.The Committee recalls that, according to the complainants, some of the dismissals effected in the context of the reorganization were in breach of the collective agreement in force with the workers and employees of state public works, in particular, its clause  which extended trade union immunity (labour stability) to all workers covered by the agreement and requires the application of a special procedure in the case of dismissals regulated by articles  and  of the Organic Labour Act which was not followed by the government of the State of Trujillo. However, the complainants do not indicate the number of dismissed workers covered by this collective agreement. The Committee notes with regret that the Government did not send its observations in this regard. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that bearing in mind the time elapsed since the dismissals (January ) and, given that a total of , workers have accepted and received their entitlements, it would be difficult to request reinstatement of all the workers covered by the collective agreement. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the workers who were dismissed in violation of the collective agreement be reinstated in their posts, and if that is not possible, that they receive adequate entitlements. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.While noting the reasons for the reorganization, the Committee cannot fail to observe that the Government makes no reference to the holding of any consultations or negotiations whatsoever with the trade unions. In this regard, the Committee again recalls that it can only regret that in the rationalization and staff reduction process, the Government did not consult or try to reach an agreement with the trade union organizations [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para.  in fine], the more so when the dismissals are allegedly in breach of clauses of a collective agreement in force applicable to some of the workers affected. The Committee expects that in future reorganizations of the public sector, due consultation will be conducted with the relevant trade unions thus avoiding unilateral decisions imposed by decree and that collective agreements will be respected until their term expires.
.The Committee had requested the Government to indicate whether it had executed the six judicial rulings on labour stability mentioned in the criminal complaint submitted to the Public Prosecutor s Office on  July  against the authorities of the Trujillo Health Foundation (FUNDASALUD) and the latter s decision in the matter and to inform it of the result of the court proceedings in respect of the order of the Inspectorate of Labour to reinstate the workers of the former Department of State Public Works (now the Department of Infrastructure). The Committee had also requested information from the complainant organizations on these reinstatements. The Committee observes with regret that neither the Government nor the complainant organizations have sent information and again requests them to send information in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expects that in future reorganizations of the public sector, the Government will conduct due consultations with the relevant trade unions thus avoiding unilateral decisions imposed by decree and will respect the collective agreements until their term expires.(b) With respect to the mass dismissals of workers in the state of Trujillo, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that all workers who were dismissed in violation of the collective agreement be reinstated in their posts and if that is not possible that they receive adequate entitlements. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) The Committee again urges the Government to indicate whether it has executed the six judicial rulings on labour stability mentioned in the criminal complaint submitted to the Public Prosecutor s Office on  July  against the authorities of the Trujillo Health Foundation (FUNDASALUD) and the latter s decision in the matter and to inform it of the result of the court proceedings in respect of the order of the Inspectorate of Labour to reinstate the workers of the former Department of State Public Works (now the Department of Infrastructure).
.The complaint is contained in a joint communication dated  September , from the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), the Construction and Timber Industry Workers' Federation of Venezuela (FEDRACONSTRUCCION), affiliated to the CTV, and the Road Workers' Union of the State of Trujillo.
.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee was obliged on two occasions to postpone its examination of the case. At its May-June  meeting [see th Report, para. ], the Committee issued an urgent appeal to the Government drawing its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it might present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting if the information and observations of the Government had not been received in due time.
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  September , the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), the Construction and Timber Industry Workers' Federation of Venezuela (FEDRACONSTRUCCION) and the Road Workers' Union of the State of Trujillo allege that, by means of a decree, the Regional Government of the State of Trujillo dismissed , workers, doctors, sportsmen and sportswomen and teachers, as well as a number of pregnant women, all employed in its service. The documents sent by the complainants show that the dismissals, took place on grounds of reorganization of the Executive, by means of Decree No.  of the Government of the State of Trujillo, which included the abolition of the Trujillo Sports Institute, the Trujillo Tourism Institute, the Centre for the Development of Crafts, Micro-enterprise and Small Industry of the State of",1,2001,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
250,"Trujillo, the Agricultural Development Corporation, the Special Fund for Child Development, the Trujillo Institute of Culture, the Trujillo Development Corporation, the Trujillo Housing Institute and the Trujillo Highways Institute, whose legal personality was thus eliminated. The complainants state that the property of those organizations remained in the hands of the State of Trujillo, and were assigned to the new organizations which resulted from the administrative reorganization, remaining in the hands of the various departments of the Executive.
.The complainants point out that this mass dismissal was unfair, being in breach of article  of the Political Constitution (which upholds stability at work and outlaws unjustified dismissals), the legal prohibition on dismissing pregnant women, the collective labour agreement and the Organic Labour Act (articles ,  and ), which provides for the irremovability of the dismissed employees, based on discussion of the draft collective agreement provided for in the same act (trade union immunity). In fact, the Executive of the State of Trujillo arbitrarily dismissed these workers, without complying with the procedures set out in article , in open disregard of article . Articles ? state as follows:' Workers shall enjoy trade union immunity during collective bargaining, in consequence of which they shall not be dismissed without good grounds that have been previously established by the labour inspector.' Any dismissal of a worker enjoying trade union immunity shall be considered null and void if the procedures laid down in article  of this Act have not been respected. Under the latter, where an employer seeks to dismiss for good reason (in this case a reorganization which, according to the complainants, is no more than a pretext) a worker enjoying trade union immunity, he shall request the corresponding authorization from the labour inspector of the jurisdiction in which the trade union is domiciled. Failing this, any worker dismissed in this way, without the established formalities having been respected, may submit a request to the labour inspector for reinstatement in his previous position.' The inspector shall verify as appropriate if irremovability applies and, if so, he shall order reinstatement in the previous position and the payment of lost earnings. The decision ordering reinstatement shall be final, except in the case of legal proceedings.
.The complainants state that, following these legal procedures, the labour inspectorate of the corresponding jurisdiction ordered in March  the reinstatement of the persons dismissed in this situation from one of the mentioned sectors (construction and medicine), as well as the payment of wages owed since the date of dismissal (the text of this order was annexed to the complaint). Nevertheless, as stated by the complainants in one of the annexes to the complaint, in spite of the final ruling of the court of first instance relating to the civil, trade, agriculture, transport, labour and stability of employment departments of the State of Trujillo, which condemns the state entity on the basis of the stability of employment proceedings initiated by various employees who were dismissed, the entity in question did not comply with the judicial decision. It also disregarded the implementing orders issued against it by the competent authorities with regard to its blatant contempt and disobedience with regard to the judicial resolutions.
.Finally, the complainants claim that there has been an extreme denial of justice, especially as the competent administrative proceedings tribunal did not admit the appeal for constitutional protection presented by the requesting parties, despite the order of the Supreme Court to admit all cases involving requests for protection and the support shown by the Committee for Human and Constitutional Rights of the National Assembly, as well as the Human Rights Committee of the State of Trujillo (as stated in the annex to the complaint).
.By a communication dated  September , the Government recalls that the complainants requested the Committee to combine the allegations in this case with those of Case No. , and it therefore considers that it would have been proper for the Committee to have restricted itself to requesting additional observations in this respect, instead of having recourse to what it considers to be an overstepping of its mandate, and a violation of the right of defence inherent in the principle of procedural symmetry. In addition, the Government points out that it is unable to comprehend the content of the allegations, what specific facts are being denounced, or which international standards are supposed to have been violated. From this perspective, it considers it important to present observations on the complainant s communication, and therefore to require any kind of reply to such an imprecise communication would violate the right to due process.
.The Committee notes the Government s request to join the allegations in this case with those of Case No. , on the grounds that the right to due process would otherwise be denied. Nevertheless, although the Committee recognizes that certain aspects of both cases may appear to overlap, the allegations in this case are different from those of Case No. . Indeed, it recalls that the latter case is concerned with anti-union legislation, suspension of collective bargaining following a decision by the authorities, convening of a national referendum on trade union issues, and hostility on the part of the authorities towards a trade union confederation (CTV), while the present case, in which the only complainant in common with the previous case is the CTV, is concerned with unfair dismissals and the denial of justice, which may also aim to obstruct the effective exercise of the freedom of association. In addition, although the national Government certainly is responsible, by definition, for ensuring that international standards are complied with throughout the territory of the country, it should nevertheless be emphasized that the scope of the present case is regional (State of Trujillo), while the context of the previous one was federal.
.The Committee also considers that the request for the examination of allegations in Case No.  did not prevent the Government in any way from sending its observations within the prescribed time limits. The Committee also recalls that when this complaint was presented, in June , the Committee had already examined Case No.  on two occasions, and that it reached definitive conclusions in November .
.The Committee deplores the fact that, despite the time that has elapsed since the submission of the complaint, and given the serious nature of the allegations that have been made, the Government has not replied to any of the allegations made by the complainants, although it has been invited on several occasions to present its own comments and observations on the case, including by means of an urgent appeal. Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see the Committee s th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is bound to present a report on the substance of the case, even without the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government, first, that the purpose of the whole procedure set up in the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. If the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognize the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them. [See First Report of the Committee, para. .]
.The Committee deplores with grave concern the fact that, despite this case concerning Venezuela being the subject of a special paragraph in the introduction of the last report of the Committee under the heading  urgent appeals' [see th Report, para. ], the Government of Venezuela still does not appear to be prepared to cooperate with the Committee with respect to the complaints made against it.
.As regards the supposedly general and vague nature of the allegations, the Committee observes that the complainants are presenting specific allegations. Indeed, they state in concrete terms that the regional Government of the State of Trujillo, for reasons of reorganization, dismissed , workers unfairly, in violation of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Organic Labour Act, which provides for irremovability as a result of discussion of the draft collective agreement, as well as in disregard for the collective labour agreement in force.
.Under these conditions, the Committee firstly recalls that governments should consult with trade union organizations to discuss the consequences of restructuring programmes on the employment and working conditions of employees [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ], without proceeding by decree. In addition, observing that the state entity which is the subject of the complaint carried out this mass dismissal while a draft collective agreement was under discussion, the Committee recalls that the dismissal of workers on grounds of trade union activities violates the principles of freedom of association and where a government has undertaken to ensure that the right to associate shall be guaranteed by appropriate",1,2001,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
251,"measures, that guarantee, in order to be effective, should, when necessary, be accompanied by measures which include the protection of workers against anti-union discrimination in their employment [see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ].
.The Committee notes that in March  the competent labour inspectorate ordered the reinstatement of some of the dismissed workers and the payment of wages owed. In addition, it appears that the competent court which dealt with the claim made by some of the dismissed employees ruled against the state entity. Nevertheless, it observes that not only did the entity in question fail to comply with these resolutions but it also disregarded the corresponding judicial implementing orders issued against it, whereby it was to reinstate the dismissed workers and pay them the wages owed since the day of their dismissal.
.Under these conditions, observing in short that the competent authorities ruled in favour of some of the dismissed workers, but that the ruling, by the labour inspectorate and the courts, was not implemented, the Committee is bound to recall that justice delayed is justice denied. It also points out the need to ensure by specific provisions accompanied by civil remedies and penal sanctions the protection of workers against acts of anti-union discrimination at the hands of employers [see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ]. The Committee therefore firmly urges the Government to ensure that the ruling concerning some of the persons dismissed by the regional Government of the State of Trujillo is implemented and that, together with the complainant organizations, it keeps it informed of the situation of the employees in whose favour orders were issued for reinstatement in their posts and the payment of wages owed.
.With respect to the remaining dismissed employees, the Committee reminds the Government that in a case involving a large number of dismissals, it would be particularly necessary for the Government to carry out an inquiry urgently in order to establish the true reasons for the measures taken [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee therefore requests the Government that if this inquiry, which must be independent, reveals that the remaining dismissals were on anti-union grounds, it should ensure that these workers are reinstated and the outstanding wages paid. It therefore requests the Government, together with the complainant organizations, to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee recalls that the dismissal of workers on grounds of trade union activities violates the principles of freedom of association and where a government has undertaken to ensure that the right to associate shall be guaranteed by appropriate measures, that guarantee, in order to be effective, should, when necessary, be accompanied by measures which include the protection of workers against anti-union discrimination in their employment.(b) The Committee is bound to recall that justice delayed is justice denied and emphasizes the need to ensure by specific provisions accompanied by civil remedies and penal sanctions the protection of workers against acts of anti-union discrimination at the hands of employers.(c) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that the ruling concerning some of the persons dismissed by the regional Government of the State of Trujillo is implemented and that, together with the complainant organizations, it keeps it informed of the situation of the employees in whose favour orders were issued for reinstatement in their posts and the payment of wages owed.(d) The Committee reminds the Government that in a case involving a large number of dismissals, it would be particularly necessary for the Government to carry out an urgent inquiry in order to establish the true reasons for the measures taken. It also requests the Government that, if this inquiry, which must be independent, reveals that the remaining dismissals, or some of them, were on anti-trade union grounds, it should ensure that these workers are reinstated and the outstanding wages paid. Finally, it requests the Government, together with the complainant organizations, to keep it informed in this respect.",1,2001,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
252,".In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendation [see th Report, para. ]:As regards the death threats allegedly made against the trade union official, Mario Naspe, by Judge Hilda Zamora, when interceding to safeguard the employment stability and physical security of a number of members of the complainant organization, the Committee notes that the Government in its reply does not refer to the death threats but to threats against employment stability. The Committee requests the Government to send observations relating specifically to alleged death threats.
.In its communications of  August and  September , the Government refers to previous communications and to a report by the Executive Board of the Magistrature which states with regard to this pending allegation that nothing could be further from the truth. The Government refers to a decision by Judge Hilda Zamora (Court No. ) rejecting the allegations and giving a completely different account of events; it cannot be deduced from that account that the alleged threats took place. The Government provides a copy of the recognition agreement of  June  between SOUNTRAJ and two other trade unions and the Executive Directorate of the Magistrature.
.In its communication of  October , the complainant organization SOUNTRAJ states that the judge who made death threats against the trade union leader Mario Naspe is no longer in office, and that no practical purpose is to be served by insisting on a recommendation on this matter. The Committee takes note of this information.
.In its communication dated  October , the complainant organization SOUNTRAJ refers to the Government s statements noted during the previous examination of the case in relation to various allegations, describes the statements in question as false, and makes new allegations. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this most recent communication.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in March  and on that occasion requested the Government to intercede with the parties with a view to obtaining the reinstatement of trade union officials, Oscar Rafael Romero Machado and Isidro Ros, and to keep it informed in this respect [see rd Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) in its communication of  May  states that the trade union officials, Mara de la Esperanza Hermida and Luis Martn Galvis, have not been notified of the closure of disciplinary proceedings instigated against them because of the strike in , and that indeed the employer s anti-union moves in the courts continued in . The Ministry of Labour suspended talks on a second collective agreement with a view to combining the text presented by the National Organized Single Trade Union of Court and Council of the Judicature Workers (SUONTRAJ) with that presented by the recently established organization SINTRAT. The CLAT also claims that the right of assembly and of unrestricted access to the headquarters of SUONTRAJ was blatantly violated between  and , despite the fact that the requirement of prior notice to ensure the safety of persons on these premises was satisfied. The union SUONTRAJ applied to the Labour Inspectorate of Maracaibo, in Zulia State, to refer the application for the reinstatement of trade union official Isidro Ros and payment of his wage arrears, but there has been no ruling on this by the Ministry of Labour. Lastly, the CLAT claims that the arguments put forward by the Government concerning union official Oscar Romero are dubious, and the administrative labour authority which, more than four years ago ordered his reinstatement, now claims not to recognize his trade union immunity.
.The SUONTRAJ, in its communication of  May , states that the union officials, Mara de la Esperanza Hermida and Luis Martn Galvis, have not been notified of the closure of disciplinary proceedings against them following the strike in , and that indeed new proceedings began before the Labour Inspectorate in response to an application to have them dismissed as a result of the strike carried out on  July and  August . The union official, Pablo Emilio Salgado Cuevas, was also included in these proceedings. The SUONTRAJ also alleges that the Ministry of Labour suspended talks on a second collective agreement, ostensibly in order to combine the text with the one presented in November  by the recently established organization SINTRAT. Referring to the Government s statements in the previous examination of the case, SUONTRAJ claims that the union official Oscar Rafael Romero Machado was detained arbitrarily on  February . On  March , he was detained again (on that occasion for  hours) while on union business. The union also complains of anti-union practices specifically against Ms. Marjoris Mndez, who was given a warning on  February  for organizing a trade union meeting. In March , threats were made against the job security of court workers of the Miranda State criminal circuit courts, despite the fact that a list of demands had been presented with a view to discussions on the second collective agreement. The SUONTRAJ adds that Judge Hilda Zamora threatened the union official, Mario Naspe, with death for having interceded to safeguard the employment security and the personal and physical safety of a number of officials who belonged to SUONTRAJ.
.The Government, in its communications of  November and  December  and  and  February , states that the Executive Directorate of the Judiciary (Supreme Court of Justice) agreed to the discontinuation of the dismissal proceedings initiated by the Labour Inspectorate of the Capital District against Mara de la Esperanza Hermida, Luis Martn Galvis and Pablo Emilo Salgado Cuevas.
.As regards the situation of the official, Marjoris Mndez, the judicial authorities quashed the appeal and upheld the warning on the grounds that the official had acted rudely and arrogantly and displayed a lack of respect towards her superior, mocking her and calling for  applause for this great president of ours'  according to statements (sent by the Government in an attachment) by presiding Judge Mirla Malave Saez of the Criminal Circuit Court in Delta Amacuro State. These documents show that the penalty was not imposed because the official in question had organized a trade union meeting.
.As regards the suspension of talks on the draft collective agreement, the Government states that negotiations on working conditions of officials of the Executive Directorate of the Judiciary began again on  June , and indicates that the parties have concluded a new collective agreement, according to an official document dated  December  (sent as an attachment).
.As regards the allegation that judiciary workers of Miranda State criminal circuit courts were threatened with the loss of their employment security, despite the fact that a list of demands had been presented with a view to discussions on the second collective labour agreement, the Government states that judges cannot in any way threaten judiciary workers of a given circuit with dismissal, as the law gives them no authority whatsoever to impose any disciplinary sanction, let alone sanctions that would result in indefinite removal of a worker from his or her post. The Government sends documents originating from the complainant union which show that the alleged acts are not linked to the exercise of trade union rights but relate to a security problem which, according to the security service, prevented some individuals from entering the Palace of Justice and led to an altercation.
.As regards the removal of Isidro Ros from his post, the Government reiterates what it has stated on previous occasions and indicates that, if Mr. Ros considered that the disciplinary proceedings against him were flawed or in any way infringed his legal or constitutional rights, he could have appealed to the courts to overturn the administrative decision and obtain suitable compensation. Mr. Ros did not, however, apply to the competent court with a view to obtaining such a ruling and being reinstated.
.As regards the complaint concerning the trade unionist, Oscar Romero Machado, the Government rejects the complainants' account of events leading to his dismissal (in ), and maintains that Mr. Romero was subsequently sentenced by the court on  March  to  hours' detention for his disrespectful and insulting behaviour towards Judges Ever Contreras and Ivn Harting ' shouting, speaking in an arrogant manner, accusing the judges of corruption and abuses of power, using obscene language, making threatening gestures at Dr. Ivn Harting, failing even to show proper respect to the security and National Guard personnel, and threatening to strike Judge Harting when he came out of his chambers, according to documents from the Tenth Court of First Instance of the Caracas civil court circuit (a copy is provided by the Government). Mr. Romero did not apply to the courts for reinstatement.
.As regards the threats by Judge Hilda Zamora against the trade union official Mario Naspe, the Government states that no stoppage ever took place for any reason, let alone for alleged verbal abuse or threats against job security, as the members",-1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
253,"of SUONTRAJ claim.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s observations, according to which:(a) the authorities have abandoned the dismissal proceedings initiated by the Labour Inspectorate of the Capital District against Mara de la Esperanza Hermida, Luis Martn Galvis and Pablo Emilio Salgado Cuevas;(b) talks on conditions of employment of employees of the Executive Directorate of the Judiciary began again on  June  and the parties concluded a new collective agreement;(c) the Government rejects the allegation that threats were made against workers' employment security during the collective bargaining;(d) the trade unionist, Oscar Romero Machado, was held under arrest for a period of  hours by order of the judicial authority on  March , for disrespectful and insulting behaviour described in detail in the Government s reply. The trade unionists, Isidro Ros and Oscar Romero Machado, did not appeal to the competent judicial authority against the decisions to dismiss them and obtain reinstatement;(e) the Government sends documents on the trade unionist, Marjoris Mndez, employed by the judicial authority, specifically regarding the reasons for the warning for rude, arrogant and sarcastic behaviour towards a superior in the presence of others, and categorically denies that the warning had anything to do with the fact that she had organized a trade union meeting.
.As regards the death threats allegedly made against the trade union official, Mario Naspe, by Judge Hilda Zamora, when interceding to safeguard the employment security stability and physical security of a number of members of the complainant organization, the Committee notes that the Government in its reply does not refer to the death threats but to threats against employment stability. The Committee requests the Government to send observations relating specifically to alleged death threats.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Ros and Mr. Romero, the Committee notes that the Government reiterates its previous observations and adds that they did not appeal to the competent judicial authority to overturn the decisions to dismiss them and obtain reinstatement. The Committee regrets that the Government has not interceded with the parties to bring about the reinstatement of the trade union officials, Rafael Romero Machado and Isidro Ros, as it had requested in its previous examination of the case, and reiterates that recommendation.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )].
.Subsequently, the Government sent new observations in a communication dated  September .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the allegations that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:- The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the competent authorities declare the disciplinary proceedings of dismissal relating to trade union officers Mara de la Esperanza Hermida, Luis Martn and Rodolfo Ascanio null and void.- The Committee requests the Government to intercede with the parties with a view to obtaining the reinstatement of trade union officers Oscar Romero and Isidro Ros.- The Committee requests the competent authorities to guarantee that the complainant may organize meetings and activities at its headquarters outside designated working hours and that they resolve the issues of security that have arisen as a result of the building in question, housing legal offices and the headquarters of the National Assembly.- The Committee requests the Government to take steps to encourage negotiation of the draft collective agreement between SUONTRAJ and SUNET, on the one hand, and the employer on the other.- The Committee requests the Government to send without delay its observations on the alleged detention of trade union officer Oscar Romero by the National Guard on  February .- With regard to the alleged surveillance of trade union official Rodolfo Ascanio, the Committee invites the complainant to provide its observations on the Government s reply.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that, in accordance with the decree on the transition plan of the authorities in , and the reorganizing of the judicial system, the Council of the Judicature was barred from continuing with the administrative proceedings, as a result of which the proceedings initiated against Mara de la Esperanza Hermida, Luis Martn and Rodolfo Ascanio came to a halt and these public employees remain in their posts.
.The Government adds that the administrative authority confirmed that Oscar Romero and Isidro Ros had committed a disciplinary offence that led to their dismissal in a procedure in which they were guaranteed due process, and this procedure was not the result of their positions as trade union officials. The Government repeats its previous reply to this allegation.
.With regard to the right of the trade union to hold meetings outside designated working hours, the Government states that public employees are permitted to enter the building so long as they have given prior notice in writing so that the security of the individuals and the premises may be ensured.
.With regard to the Committee s recommendation relating to encouraging collective bargaining, the Government states that it is pleased to announce that the competent authorities are carrying out economic studies to establish the cost of the draft collective agreement with SUONTRAJ and SUNET.
.With regard to the alleged detention of trade union official Oscar Romero by the National Guard on  February , the Government denies this allegation and states that what happened was that Mr. Romero tried to enter court headquarters with alcoholic drinks which is not permitted by judicial order. According to the police statement, which it has attached, it seems that the National Guard only prevented Mr. Romero from distributing the bottles of beer that he was carrying and that he was not detained or mistreated.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements according to which: () the disciplinary proceedings against trade union officials Mara de la Esperanza Hermida, Luis Martn and Rodolfo Ascanio were brought to a halt; () the competent authorities carried out economic studies to establish the cost of the draft collective agreement with SUONTRAJ and SUNET; () trade union official Oscar Romero was not detained; he was only prevented from entering court headquarters with alcoholic drinks; () with regard to the right of the trade union to hold meetings outside designated working hours, entry is permitted to those public employees who have given prior written notice in order to ensure the security of individuals and premises.
.The Committee notes, however, that the Government repeats its previous point of view with regard to the dismissal of trade union officials Oscar Romero and Isidro Ros. The Committee regrets that the Government makes no mention in its reply to any intercession with the parties (contrary to the Committee s request) in order to obtain the reinstatement of the trade union officials mentioned and, therefore, it repeats, once again, its conclusions. Therefore the Committee requests the Government to intercede with the parties with a view to obtaining the reinstatement of trade union officials Raphael Romero Machado and Isidro Ros. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the complainant organization has not provided its observations, as requested on the Government s reply relating to the alleged surveillance by the National Guard of trade union official Rodolfo Ascanio. Therefore, the Committee will not proceed to examine this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to intercede with the parties with a view to obtaining the reinstatement of trade union officials Rafael Romero Machado and Isidro Ros and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras. -].
.In communications dated  August and  November , SUONTRAJ sent new allegations. The Government sent new observations in communications dated  October ,  November  and  January .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the competent authorities declare the disciplinary proceedings of dismissal relating to trade union officers Ms. Mara de la Esperanza Hermida, Mr. Luis Martn Galviz and Mr. Rodolfo Rafael Ascanio Fierro null and void.(b) The Committee requests the Government to intercede with the parties with a view to obtaining the reinstatement of trade union officers Mr. Oscar Rafael Romero Machado and Mr. Isidro Ros.(c) The Committee requests the competent authorities to guarantee that the complainant may organize meetings and activities at its headquarters outside designated working hours and that they resolve the issues of security",-1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
254,"that have arisen as a result of the building in question housing legal offices and the headquarters of the National Assembly.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take steps to encourage negotiation of the draft (second) collective agreement between SUONTRAJ and SUNET on the one hand and the employer on the other.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send without delay its observations on the alleged detention of trade union officer Mr. Oscar Romero by the National Guard on  February .(f) With regard to the alleged surveillance of trade union official Mr. Rodolfo Rafael Ascanio Fierro, the Committee invites the complainant to provide its observations on the Government s reply.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Organized Single Trade Union of Court and Council of the Judicature Workers (SUONTRAT) dated  May . The Government sent its observations in the communications of  and  February .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant alleges that the Judicial Emergency Commission and the Commission on the Functioning and Restructuring of the Judicial System, which replaced the former, committed acts which violated trade union rights to the detriment of the complainant and its officers. In particular, the complainant alleges: () the derogation of the collective agreement in force in the sector and the suspension of the presentation of lists of demands pursuant to a resolution, as well as the fact that the authorities negotiate with other organizations in the judicial field which are controlled by the employer; () the suspension and dismissal of trade union officers; () the suspension of trade union leave; and () the harassment of trade union officers who were detained or placed under surveillance by the security forces.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the derogation of the collective agreement in force in the sector and the suspension of the presentation of lists of demands pursuant to a resolution, and the fact that the authorities negotiate with other organizations in the judicial field which are controlled by the employer, the Committee notes that the Government states that: (i) on  November  an agreement was reached between the parties (SUONTRAT and the Executive Directorate of the Magistracy) on the fulfilment of obligations under the collective agreement; (ii) on  November  it was agreed to request that the negotiation deadline be extended until  February ; and (iii) the Executive Directorate of the Magistracy has fulfilled agreements concluded with SUONTRAT in December . In this respect, the Committee recalls that the suspension or derogation of collective agreements freely entered into by the parties violates the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining established in Article  of Convention No.  and regrets that the collective agreement in force in the judicial sector was derogated unilaterally. However, the Committee notes that SUONTRAT and the relevant authorities have commenced negotiations for a new collective agreement and that, in the meantime, they have concluded agreements, which, according to the Government, have been observed. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to endeavour to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation in this sector between SUONTRAT and the relevant authorities.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the suspension and dismissal of trade union officers, the Committee observes with concern that these measures could have affected a significant number of officers of the complainant organization. In this context, before examining the cases specifically referred to in the complaint, the Committee would recall that  one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.Concerning the alleged suspension of SUONTRAT trade union officers Ms. Elena Coromoto Marval and Mr. Derio Jos Martnez Moreno, without the reasons for this measure being given, and without an administrative procedure being carried out beforehand, the Committee notes that the Government states that the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that  the measures taken against the plaintiffs by the Commission on the Functioning and Restructuring of the Judicial System constitute a flagrant violation of article  of the Constitution (right to due process)'  In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to immediately lift the suspension of the trade union officers in question and to keep it informed in this regard.
.Regarding the alleged dismissal of trade union officer Mr. Isidro Ros, the Committee notes that the Government states that within the framework of the amparo proceedings before the Supreme Court of Justice, it was found that  there is no evidence that Isidro Ros ' whose dismissal while he was organization secretary for the Zulia trade union branch was denounced in the amparo proceedings ' is a member of the trade union s national board, which would entitle him to security of tenure'  In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to carry out an inquiry into the dismissal of Mr. Ros (a trade union officer, according to the complainant) and reinstate him if he is found to have been dismissed on anti-union grounds (for carrying out trade union activities, being a member of the trade union SUONTRAT, etc.). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.With regard to allegations concerning () the suspension of Ms. Consuelo Ramrez, president of the Barinas branch of SUONTRAT, on  January ; () the opening of disciplinary proceedings for the dismissal of Ms. Mara de la Esperanza Hermida Moreno, president of SUONTRAT, Mr. Luis Martn Glviz, finance secretary of SUONTRAT and Mr. Rodolfo Rafael Ascanio Fierro, information and propaganda secretary of SUONTRAT (with regard to the latter, the complainant also invokes the suspension of his salary since February ); and () the dismissal of Mr. Oscar Rafael Romero Machado, safety and health secretary of SUONTRAT, on  January , the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent the necessary observations in this regard, and has only stated that in the context of the amparo proceedings instituted by SUONTRAT before the Supreme Court of Justice, the judicial authorities found that  with regard to the complaints relating to the reinstatement of workers, the payment of salaries, etc., the court observes that if such violations were to exist, they would, in any event, be offences under the ordinary law and not direct violations of the Constitution, which, combined with the fact that the plaintiff does not indicate the specific act which directly violates a constitutional guarantee, means that the plaintiff s complaints are inadmissible'  In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to initiate detailed inquiries into these allegations and communicate its observations on this matter without delay.
.As for the alleged suspension of trade union leave for all SUONTRAT officers, the Committee notes that the Government states that on  November  substantial agreements were reached between SUONTRAT and the Executive Directorate of the Magistracy on the fulfilment of obligations under the collective agreement and, inter alia, agreement was reached to establish the necessary mechanisms to reintroduce such leave. In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to ensure observance of the collective agreement clauses relating to the trade union leave of SUONTRAT officers.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not communicated its observations concerning the following allegations: (i) the restriction of the use of the national trade union headquarters of SUONTRAT, based on the argument that the building where the union premises are located cannot be accessed outside designated hours of work; (ii) detention by the National Guard of SUONTRAT trade union officer Mr. Oscar Romero on  February ; (iii) summons of Mr. Argenis Acua Padrn, disputes and complaints secretary of SUONTRAT, to appear before the Court of the Penal Circuit of the State of Carabobo; and (iv) the surveillance of Mr. Ascanio Fierro, a SUONTRAT officer, by members of the National Guard when he went to claim his salary for February . In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning these allegations without delay.
.In the light of its foregoing",0,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

256,".At its meeting in March , the Committee examined this case, in which the complainant had disputed the legitimacy of a trade union voting procedure in which non-union members had participated and the purpose of which had been to bring about the merger of two trade unions in the Caracas metro sector. More specifically, the complainant had challenged a decree by the former Minister of Labour dated  November , which had legalized the merger of the two unions representing employees of C.A. Metro de Caracas and the election of a new union committee of the C.A. Metro de Caracas Workers' Union. The Committee considered that the Minister s decree violated the most elementary principle of freedom of association, i.e. that only trade union members can decide on their trade union structures and the composition of the unions' executive bodies. The Committee strongly rejected this type of statement, and urged the Government to respect Convention No.  and not to interfere in the internal affairs of trade union organizations.
.The Committee concluded its examination with the following recommendations [see the th Report of the Committee, paras. -]:' Noting that the Government has violated Convention No. , the Committee hopes that the courts will annul the decree issued by the former Minister of Labour on  November , as well as the trade union merger of SITRAMECA and ASUTMETRO, and urges the Government to ensure that this process only takes place if initiated by the trade union members of both organizations in full freedom.' The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.In its communications of  and  March , the Government attaches a copy of the Supreme Court of Justice Ruling of  March , which renders null and void the decree of the Minister of Labour of  November .
.The Committee notes this information with satisfaction.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the C.A. Metro de Caracas Workers' Union (SITRAMECA) dated  March . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  February .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  March , the C.A. Metro de Caracas Workers' Union (SITRAMECA) states that on  September , an extraordinary general assembly was called for the two unions in C.A. Metro de Caracas (SITRAMECA and ASUTMETRO), with the aim of merging them. SITRAMECA adds that the merger process has been raised before the courts owing to serious legal errors. This has brought the whole process into disrepute and undermined its legitimacy as well as placing the workers of C.A. Metro de Caracas in an indefensible position as the enterprise does not acknowledge SITRAMECA. Agreements between both trade union organizations aimed at carrying out a new merger process are being prepared; these agreements will safeguard current legal standards and guarantee effective and efficient protection of the rights and interests of the workers.
.The complainant states that on  November  the Government, through the Minister of Labour, sent an unnumbered decree dissolving one trade union organization, merging it with the other and arbitrarily legalizing the abovementioned disputed merger process between the two unions, i.e. the Single Association of Workers of C.A. Metro de Caracas (ASUTMETRO) and the C.A. Metro de Caracas Workers' Union (SITRAMECA), demonstrating explicit and undue interference in union matters without observing the standards for this type of procedure that exist in current labour standards. The complainant considers that the Minister of Labour's actions constitute flagrant interference in the internal functioning of the abovementioned trade union organizations. In light of the fact that the merger process was taking place between the trade union organizations, it should have been the trade union organizations themselves who resolved any differences rather than a high-level government civil servant who, in doing so, violated Article  of Convention No. . The interference of the Minister of Labour in dissolving one trade union organization and merging it with the other also violates Article  of Convention No. . The complainant attaches a copy of the Decree of  November  of the Minister of Labour.
.In its communications of  September  and  February , the Government categorically rejects the complaint because the decision to dissolve ASUTMETRO was freely and autonomously taken during the assembly that was attended by a representative number of workers on  August .The announcement of the irrevocability of the trade union merger, agreed upon in a decision of  September  by SITRAMECA and ASUTMETRO, is the result of the exercise of freedom of association, as is the compliance with the outcome of the electoral process which took place with no interference from the Government during the electoral process. The Decree of the Minister of Labour does not represent appointment of the leadership of the trade union committee, it merely lists the names of the newly elected officials.
.The Government explains that on  August  the Act outlining the agreement reached between the leadership of the Single Association of Workers of C.A. Metro de Caracas (ASUTMETRO) and the C.A. Metro de Caracas Workers' Union (SITRAMECA) and members of the National Constituent Assembly was signed, and the merger process between the two trade unions began. Subsequently, on  August, ASUTMETRO called an ordinary assembly, in accordance with that which had been agreed and signed in the Act of  August  where, among other things, they decided to automatically dissolve themselves as a trade union organization once the new leadership had been elected by single electoral process. On  September , the first integrated extraordinary general assembly took place with a relatively broad and representative audience from the two trade union organizations, and a series of decisions were made as follows:
.The legitimacy of a new trade union directorate, arising out of the convocation of a single electoral process, is officially declared to this combined general assembly of the workers of C.A. Metro de Caracas as the highest sovereign representative body to determine and proclaim irrevocable the trade union merger ' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:

.The combined general assembly of workers sets a maximum period of  days from the present date ( September ) to establish a single electoral process wherein all workers protected by the collective agreement, whether or not they are members of one of the two trade unions of Metro, shall have the right to vote in collective, secret and direct elections ' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.A preliminary electoral commission will be set up to organize and administer the single electoral process. This commission shall comprise nine () workers, democratically chosen from among those at the combined general assembly. These workers shall accept the duty conferred on them, having no position of responsibility in the trade union organizations currently in existence in the enterprise nor electing to accept any position of responsibility in the single electoral process ' (the members of this commission being elected under this same act).
.The Government states that following judicial proceedings, the court ruled that the challenged assembly was void, as the requirements of article  of the Organic law of labour had not been complied with; the Ministry of Labour decided not to give an opinion as regards the notice that should be given by the union executives to the enterprise, since the Supreme Court of Justice has not yet issued its judgement on a new judicial proceeding filed with it. The Government adds that the assembly published this first communiqu of  approved decisions signed by Mr. Francisco Torrealba (signatory to the complaint before the Committee of Freedom of Association) on behalf of SITRAMECA, and Mr. Oscar Aparicio on behalf of ASUTMETRO. On  September  another communiqu was published informing all those workers interested in taking part in the single electoral process to submit their nominations and the prerequisites that must be fulfilled. Voting took place on  October , scrutineering was carried out in the presence of the members of the single electoral commission and subsequently a voting report giving details of the results of the elections for the executive committee and disciplinary tribunal was presented. On  October , the commission carried out the induction of the new executive committee and the disciplinary tribunal.
.However, prior to the induction of the elected trade union members, those who had been defeated in the elections apparently presented a series of challenges which led to the single electoral commission issuing a decision on  October  relating to the challenges to candidates, wherein they stated, among other things, the following:
.The single electoral commission has complete authority and autonomy to proceed with the single electoral process, according to the mandate of the combined general",0,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
257,"assembly of  September .
.The decisions of the combined extraordinary general assembly of  September  form the fundamental framework of standards for the single electoral process; there is no express exception therein regarding the prohibition of nominations.
.Documentary evidence supporting the challenges to the contested candidates was late in arriving.
.These challenges should have been raised at the combined extraordinary general assembly of  September  so that exclusions to the nominations might have been clarified.
.Subsequently, a Decree issued by the Minister of Labour merely listed the names of the newly elected officials and acknowledged the merger of the two trade unions as legitimate (on  December , a worker of the enterprise filed proceedings against this Decree with the Supreme Court of Justice; the suit is at the preliminary stage and the Government will provide the judgement once it is issued).
.In this course of events it is essential to emphasize that the combined extraordinary general assembly of  September , wherein the trade union alliance was announced, agreed to hold a single electoral process where all workers, whether they were affiliated or not to one of the two existing trade unions of the enterprise, might vote; and it was decided to merge the trade unions into the one with the greater number of members. ASUTMETRO, therefore, would be dissolved as a result of the trade union merger. The accusations that the Minister of Labour's Decree was responsible for the dissolution of a trade union organization is completely false. This decision was freely and autonomously taken by ASUTMETRO as shown by the Act of  August . The Government therefore categorically rejects the false accusation of violation of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The agreement reached by these trade unions to undertake a merger is a clear demonstration of the exercising of freedom of association with full autonomy of administrative organization and free election of representatives as laid down in Convention No. . These trade union organizations are therefore fulfilling certain basic functions that are part of their raison d'tre; and it is vitally important to recognize and strengthen those institutions that are truly representative of Venezuelan workers for social dialogue and participation.
.The Minister of Labour's actions were limited to noting the voting report presented by the single electoral commission on  October  and to listing the names of the newly elected officials of the executive committee and the disciplinary tribunal, according to the Act. The Government merely issued an administrative Act for a specific purpose. This Act was not standard setting in nature: it merely listed the names of the newly elected officials and did not represent appointments by the Government to the executive committee and disciplinary tribunal.
.Furthermore, the Government believes that the Decree in question conforms with article  of the Constitution of Venezuela (repealed), which guarantees the rights of trade union members and employers, as this administrative Act occurred when that Constitution was in force. This Decree is also in line with article  of the new Constitution, which was approved as a result of a countrywide constitutional referendum on  December  and entered into force on  December  when it was published in the Official Gazette No. .. This constitutional document is fully in line with Convention No.  as it lays down that trade union organizations shall not be subject to interference, suspension or dissolution by public authorities and that workers shall be protected against all acts of discrimination or interference contrary to the exercise of this right.
.Regarding the group of workers from SITRAMECA who contested the results of the elections, this group should contest the election results before the competent legal authorities rather than the Decree issued by the Minister of Labour, as this in no way represents interference of any kind in the trade union process.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant objects to a Decree issued by the Minister of Labour on  November , which, it believes, dissolves one of the two trade union organizations of C.A. Metro de Caracas, merging it with the other trade union organization of that enterprise, and arbitrarily legalizes a merger process between the two trade union organizations.
.The Committee notes the Government's statements that: () the trade union organizations of ASUTMETRO and SITRAMECA agreed to carry out a merger in which ASUTMETRO would freely and autonomously cease to exist, according to the Act of  August  in which members of the National Constituent Assembly participated; () the combined extraordinary general assembly of  September  agreed to a single electoral process wherein all workers, whether they were affiliated or not to one of the two trade unions, would have the right to vote and decided to merge the trade unions into the one with the greater number of members, with ASUTMETRO subsequently being dissolved as a result of the trade union merger; () in its Decree of  November  (which has been appealed to the Supreme Court of Justice), the Minister of Labour limited himself to noting the voting report presented by the single electoral commission on  October  and to listing the names of the newly elected officials of the executive committee and the disciplinary tribunal; this was purely an administrative Act that mentioned only the results of the elections; () prior to those elected taking up their duties it seems there were a series of challenges from those who had been defeated that the single electoral commission decided to reject; and () a court has declared void the assembly of  September , but an appeal against this decision has been filed with the Supreme Court of Justice.
.The Committee would like to point out that in the series of events related by the Government there is one element that stands out: the single electoral process allowed the workers of C.A. Metro de Caracas to vote, whether they were members or not of the ASUTMETRO or SITRAMECA trade union organizations. The Committee considers that this fact, whether or not it was agreed to by the trade unions in question, invalidates the trade union merger and the appointment of the trade union bodies. The Decree of the Minister of Labour which ""recognizes as legitimate the merger of the two trade unions of the C.A. Metro de Caracas company and the election of the new executive committee of the Workers' Union of C.A. Metro de Caracas"" violates the most fundamental principle of freedom of association, i.e. that only trade union members can decide on their trade union structures and the organization of the institutions of these structures. The Committee strongly rejects this type of statement and urges the Government to respect Convention No.  and not to interfere in internal matters of trade union organizations. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to Articles  and  of Convention No.  as follows:Article Workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation.Article 
.Workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes.
.The public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.In these circumstances and taking into account the judicial proceedings that have been filed, the Committee hopes that the courts will annul the Minister of Labour's Decree of  November , as well as the trade union merger of SITRAMECA and ASUTMETRO, and urges the Government to ensure that this process only takes place if initiated by the trade union members of both organizations in full freedom. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Noting that the Government has violated Convention No. , the Committee hopes that the courts will annul the Decree issued by the Minister of Labour on  November , as well as the trade union merger of SITRAMECA and ASUTMETRO, and urges the Government to ensure that this process only takes place if initiated by the trade union members of both organizations in full freedom.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.",1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
258,".At its November  meeting, the Committee submitted a number of legislative questions to the Committee of Experts and also made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to put an end to the functions of the National Electoral Council as it is established in the National Constitution and to repeal the Special Statute on the renewal of trade union leadership. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any steps taken in this regard. Moreover, if this Statute has been applied from the date of its promulgation to that of the examination of this case, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the trade unions which so wish may hold new elections governed by the provisions of their by-laws and without any interference whatsoever by the authorities or by bodies that have nothing to do with workers' organizations.
.In communications of  November  and  March and  October , the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) indicated that the authorities, and in particular the President of the Republic, deny that the CTV is the most representative organization. It also alleges that the authorities have made statements to the media interfering in the electoral process of the CTV discrediting it, as well as criticizing its president. The CTV sent press cuttings in support of its claims to demonstrate the hostility directed against it. The CTV also refers to the fact that the authorities are promoting a parallel confederation loyal to the government party. It adds that in January  the workers of the Trade Union of Workers of the Construction Industry of Caracas, Vargas and the State of Miranda, while participating in a demonstration, were mercilessly repressed by order of the Mayor s Office of Municipio Libertador on  January ;  workers were injured by the municipal police force ' five were shot, four were attacked by dogs and three were beaten. The mayor of the municipality also ordered a construction company to stop contracting trade union members, describing unemployment as one of the  advantages' of trade union membership. Furthermore, the Minister of Labour did not invite the CTV to the tripartite committee (discussion on the minimum wage) and more recently it was not consulted about a draft bill relating to conflict resolution in the event of economic crisis (mass dismissals).
.In its communication of  July , the ICFTU states that on the afternoon of  July, following a mass march which peacefully and democratically called for the necessary changes to be made to overcome the current political, economic and social crisis affecting Venezuela, a group of approximately  motorized individuals, politically identified with the Government, aggressively and violently stormed the area surrounding the headquarters of the CTV, yelling threats and throwing dangerous objects and homemade explosives at the premises, even firing guns, resulting in extensive damage to the lower floor of the building. A number of witnesses, including trade union officials, journalists and other people using the building, confirmed this allegation, which was corroborated by Commissioner Miguel Mora, chief of the Andrs Bello municipal police station. The ICFTU considers that the aggression directed at the CTV s premises is just one of a number of occurrences that confirm an ongoing anti-union climate upheld by the Government and its forces. Despite the fact that there were no victims, this attack could have injured dozens of people who were working in the building.
.With its communication of  February , the Government sent a long communication on the trade union election procedure and the results of the electoral process, with , trade union organizations having concluded the procedure to date. It referred to a number of specific irregularities adding that , collective agreements have been concluded with the mediation of the Ministry of Labour. It included press cuttings to show that members of the CTV were satisfied with the results of the elections.
.In an extensive communication dated  November , the Government states that the CTV is the most representative trade union organization and it is untrue that the authorities do not recognize this organization as the legitimate representative of its affiliated workers. The problem is of another kind; more specifically, it is an intra-union problem as those who proclaimed themselves the legitimate and legally elected members are being challenged by other candidates who participated in the electoral process, and in this respect challenges remain that have yet to be decided. Complaints and civil procedures, administrative and penal disputes have been brought by these trade unions and by first and second level organizations, particularly for the violation of the applicable regulations and the trade union by?laws approved by the CTV. Consequently, the Government cannot say which are the legitimate and legal representatives, or it could be accused of interference and favouritism. The self-proclaimed members of the executive committee of the CTV (including the self-proclaimed president) have undertaken actions contrary to the rule of law and to democracy and they had a high level of involvement and responsibility in the coup d at of  April  and continue to carry out conspiratorial activities, even supporting a military uprising to destabilize the democracy and interfere with human rights. The Government denies that it is developing an anti-union policy against the CTV and indicates that the CTV s allegations (hostile treatment, refusal to recognize its officials and promoting the creation of a parallel confederation) reveal the response of the Venezuelan people to the abovementioned attitude of its self-proclaimed officials. The allegation that the President of the Republic is promoting a workers' confederation loyal to his party is absolutely false and lacking in any proof. The President has in fact met with a number of organizations (including some affiliated to the CTV), currents and social movements at the request of these sectors, which consider that the self-proclaimed officials of the CTV lack legitimacy, and they have sought to promote a process of social dialogue and have asked for clean and transparent elections for the executive committee of the CTV. The Government responded that it cannot and must not interfere in electoral processes by reason of the Constitution.
.As to the allegation that the CTV was not consulted concerning a draft bill, the Government says that through the media it convened all interested persons and workers' and employers' organizations and that subsequently consultations were held with the organizations that took the initiative to participate; for example, employers' organizations such as FEDECAMARAS submitted their observations. A meeting was also convened for interested trade union organizations to participate in. It is therefore untrue that the CTV was not invited or that it was prevented from participating in this process; the self?proclaimed president of the CTV refused to participate or neglected to do so and the Government invites him to take an active role in the social and trade union dialogue that is under way in the country.
.With regard to its previous recommendation concerning the need to put an end to the functions of the National Electoral Council (CNE) in respect of trade union elections, the Committee deplores the fact that the Government has not sent any observations in this connection. The Committee observes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations referred to this matter at its December  meeting in an observation that is reproduced below:Article  and the eighth transitional provision, which provide that the Electoral Authority (the National Electoral Council) is responsible for organizing the elections of occupational unions and that, pending promulgation of the new electoral laws provided for in the Constitution, electoral process will be convened, organized, managed and supervised by the National Electoral Council. In this respect, the Committee notes the Government s statements that: (i) the draft Bill to amend the Organic Labour Act proposes an amendment to section , which provides that trade union organizations may request the cooperation of the Electoral Authority for the holding of elections to their executive bodies; (ii) once this provision has received parliamentary approval, it will repeal the Special Transitional Rules for the renewal of trade union leadership; and (iii) the eighth transitional provision of the Constitution of the Republic is no longer in force and is not therefore applicable. Notwithstanding the Government s observations, the Committee considers that it should amend article  of the Constitution of the Republic to remove from paragraph  the power entrusted to the Electoral Authority, through the National Electoral Council, to organize the elections of trade unions, and it requests the Government to provide information in its next report on any measure adopted in this respect. The Committee also notes that the direct contacts mission expressed its concern with regard to the draft Electoral Bill, which maintains the intervention of the National Electoral Council in trade union matters. In this regard, the Committee notes that on  October  approval was given to the Organic Act respecting the Electoral Authority, which contains provisions that are not in conformity with",0,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
259,"the Convention (for example section , which makes the National Council competent for organizing trade union elections, proclaiming the elected candidates, monitoring elections and declaring them null and void, hearing and resolving appeals and investigating complaints). The Committee once again reminds the Government that the regulation of trade union election procedures and arrangements must be done by trade union statutes and not by a body outside the workers' organizations. In these conditions, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend article  of the Constitution of the Republic and the Organic Act respecting the Electoral Authority, which provides for its intervention in the elections of workers' organizations, and to provide information in its next report on any measures adopted in this respect.
.The Committee fully shares the point of view expressed by the Committee of Experts and urges the Government to amend article  of the Constitution and the Organic Act respecting the Electoral Authority as indicated.
.As regards the alleged support of a parallel trade union confederation by the authorities, the alleged interference by the authorities in the electoral process of the CTV, and the discrediting of the CTV and its president by means of hostile statements made by the President of the Republic to the media, the Committee notes the Government s statements in which it emphatically denies that the authorities are promoting a parallel trade union confederation, that it refuses to recognize the representativity of the CTV and that it has interfered in the electoral process, and indicating that the electoral process of the CTV and its self-proclaimed leaders has been contested before the competent authorities by other trade union organizations and their representatives. The Committee nevertheless emphasizes that the numerous press cuttings sent by the CTV show that the members of the executive committee of the CTV were insulted and discredited by the authorities, and it consequently urges the Government to take measures to ensure that the authorities refrain from making intimidating statements to the CTV. Furthermore, concerning the challenges to the CTV s electoral process, the Committee stresses that the authorities must not deprive the members of the executive committee of the CTV of legitimacy in the absence of a pronouncement by the judicial authority nullifying the elections. Indeed, the Committee has pointed out on previous occasions that in order to avoid the danger of serious limitation on the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom, complaints brought before labour courts by an administrative authority challenging the results of trade union elections should not ' pending the final outcome of the judicial proceedings ' have the effect of suspending the validity of such elections [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ]. The Committee therefore asks the Government to recognize the executive committee of the CTV.
.As to the alleged lack of consultation of the CTV concerning a draft bill, the Committee notes that the Government invited generally through the press, all trade union organizations to participate in consultations and that the CTV failed to attend, nor did it present any observations in writing. The Committee observes that the Government has not referred to a similar allegation relating to its failure to invite the CTV to the tripartite committee to discuss the minimum wage. The Committee wishes to emphasize that the most representative confederation at the national level cannot be treated as if it were just another trade union organization and that in cases such as those alleged it should have been invited directly, formally and individually, and not through the press, to participate in the process. The Committee asks the Government in future to duly respect and consult it on all draft bills relating to labour issues and to abide by its status as the most representative trade union confederation.
.In this respect the Committee stresses that the most representative employers' and workers' organizations, and in particular the confederations, should be consulted at length by the authorities on matters of mutual interest, including everything relating to the preparation and application of legislation concerning matters relating to them and to the fixing of minimum wages; this would contribute to legislation, programmes and measures that the public authorities have to adopt or apply being more solidly founded and to greater compliance and better implementation. This being the case, the Government should, as far as possible, also base itself on the consensus of workers' and employers' organizations, which should share the responsibility for achieving well-being and prosperity for the community in general. This is particularly true in light of the growing complexity of problems facing societies, and also, of course, facing the people of Venezuela. No public authority should claim to hold all knowledge nor presume that what it proposes will always and entirely satisfy the objectives in any given situation. The Committee requests the Government to apply these principles in future.
.Lastly, the Committee observes with concern, and deplores the fact, that the Government has not responded to the serious allegations of anti-union violence submitted by the ICFTU in its communication of  July  nor to the allegations by the CTV concerning acts of violence against members of the Trade Union of Workers of the Construction Industry of Caracas, Vargas and the State of Miranda and against the CTV. The Committee urges the Government to send its observations in this respect without delay and immediately to carry out an urgent investigation into these allegations.
.The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (June )].
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  June .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the allegations that remained pending:' the Committee reiterates its previous recommendations and demands that the Government take measures to repeal or substantially amend the trade union standards and decrees that are in violation of Conventions Nos.  and , adopted since the arrival of the new Government. The Committee also demands that the Government take steps to withdraw the Bill for the protection of trade union guarantees and freedoms and the Bill for the democratic rights of workers, which contain restrictions to trade union rights that are incompatible with Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations concerning the new allegations submitted by the CTV ( and  April ) and the ICFTU ( May ).
.In its communications dated  and  April , the CTV had sent statements made by the President of the Republic following a strike in the petroleum sector which they considered to be hostile to the Confederation and to clearly display favouritism with regard to the Bolivarian Workers' Force (a partial transcription is given below): They threatened to bring the petroleum enterprise to a standstill and I sent them the message: go ahead! I l tell you how it happened. Manuit, the gang of four of the Accin democrtica sent a message to the Government saying if we didn t give them this, that and the other they would paralyse the petroleum industry. So I told them: go ahead! I give you my permission. Of course we immediately started preparing our contingency plans and talking to petroleum workers everywhere. They called the strike and fell flat on their faces. They came up against the workers' conscience. They have failed yet again, they are dead, there is nothing they can do anymore ' the Venezuelan petroleum workers do not believe in you anymore. We have new leaders now. You might as well face it. You ought to back down quietly as others have done but if you want to carry on fighting you will be beaten again, every time you stick your necks out you are going to get it, you union bosses and bandits of the Accin democrtica gang of four. Come on out and see what happens to you, you will be defeated again and again and soon there will be trade union elections. I call on the Venezuelan working class to elect real workers' leaders who are committed not only to the working class but to the revolution, the Bolivarian revolution, the working class should be aware not only of its own interests but those of the country in general  ? I call on the workers to join the Bolivarian Workers' Force, that is the way to fight for their interests and move ahead with the revolution.'  They are heading for defeat (the CTV) because they are doomed to suffer their most crushing defeat at our hands and we will continue to defeat them. Workers of Venezuela, unite. Bolivarian Workers' Force, attack! To",1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
260,"the trade union elections, take your new place in a revolutionary trade union movement committed, I repeat, to the working class and the revolution, to the country. Take up the Bolivarian struggle, defend the revolution and do not let yourselves be manipulated by all these union bosses whom we are gradually displacing. Good luck Nicols, the Bolivarian Teachers' Force is also gaining ground and growing everywhere. They held their assembly a few days ago and we beat the teacher s union bosses who were also threatening to paralyse the education system by more than a minimum percentage; Venezuelan education did not stop and is not stopping now, the Bolivarian education process is moving ahead; no one can stop the Bolivarian schools. So it should be emphasized today that we are pushing ahead with the revolution; the past week has been a very positive one, a week of victories showing the country and the world that the revolution is consolidating itself; we defeated the petroleum union bosses sector and new trade unions and new leaders are emerging in the petroleum sector. We defeated the call made by the teachers' union bosses and a Bolivarian Teachers' Force is arising.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The CTV had also alleged that new provisions had been adopted that implied state interference in trade union affairs. Specifically, the CTV objects to the Special Statute for the renewal of the trade union leadership issued by the National Electoral Council (CNE) and published in the Official Gazette on  April . The CTV alleges that the Statute in question empowers the CNE to organize, authorize and suspend trade union elections. According to the CTV this is an abuse of power aimed at stripping trade union organizations of the ability to organize their own elections; pursuant to this Statute, it will be up to the CNE to grant prior authorization for any trade union election process. Lastly, the CTV adds that the Statute in question contains a large number of provisions that violate the principle of trade union autonomy and freedom of association. Moreover, the CTV objects to resolution No. -- of  April  of the Comptroller-General s Office of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which requires trade union officials to declare their assets to the Comptroller s Office within  days following their election. The CTV alleges that this provision distorts the nature of the statutory obligation to declare their assets to the membership and the internal supervisory bodies of trade union organizations.
.In its communication dated  May , the ICFTU alleges that the SIDOR-Consorcio Amazonia enterprise refused to negotiate a new collective agreement with the Single Trade Union of Iron and Steel and Allied Workers of the State of Bolvar (SUTISS). The ICFTU states that in accordance with the terms of the current collective agreement, the draft new agreement had been deposited  days before its expiry with the Zona de Hierro labour inspectorate. According to the ICFTU, the enterprise s refusal to negotiate a new collective agreement aims at disregarding fundamental gains achieved by the workers and continuing the process of making labour more precarious, initiated with the privatization of SIDOR.
.In its communication dated  June , concerning the allegation regarding interference by the Comptroller-General s Office of the Republic, the Government states that there is no provision stipulating intervention by the Comptroller-General s Office in the administration of trade union funds. This body only intervenes in the administration of a trade union at the request of its members and when the supervisory body of the confederation or federation does not reply or take a decision on a request made by its members, within  days of the date of the request, to investigate the accounts of the administration concerned (a long-standing provision contained in the Organic Labour Act of November , section , second paragraph). The Government states that it must be noted that the Comptroller-General s Office of the Republic is a functionally autonomous body which even supervises the administration of the Government, since the Comptroller is elected by the National Assembly on the basis of a shortlist presented by civil society, which guarantees its independence. Specifically, as regards the disputed resolution No. -- of  April  of the Comptroller-General s Office of the Republic, published in Official Gazette No , of  April , which stipulates that trade union officials shall individually present this body with a sworn declaration of assets before and after taking up their office, there is a whole range of procedures for filing appeals and challenges available to anyone who feels their rights have been infringed, which in this case have not been exhausted by the complainants.
.As regards trade union elections, the Government states that it has to ensure that they are conducted in accordance with the constitutional provision enshrined in Article  of Convention No.  concerning universal, direct and secret suffrage, and that the spirit of the Convention is accordingly embodied in article  of the Constitution. According to the Government, the means to achieve the aim of Convention No.  have now been strengthened by the presence of the Electoral Power that is functionally entirely independent and largely comprised of members of civil society and of the law faculties of the country s universities. The Government states that the National Electoral Council (CNE) has the main objective of guaranteeing respect for the voters' will and for their right to participate directly in trade union affairs through free elections in which equality of treatment without any discrimination whatsoever is guaranteed, in a climate of impartiality, transparency and reliability of the electoral committees; this aspect corresponds precisely to the provisions laid down in article  of the national Constitution.
.The Government points out that progress has been achieved in the re-legitimization process backed by all of the trade union movements in the country, with the presence of the CNE, in that the trade unions have contributed their database and the CNE has been able to compare it with its own data from the permanent electoral register. In the new Constitution, the Constituent Power, expressing the will of the entire people of Venezuela, sanctioned what is termed the Electoral Power, which enjoys organic independence and functional autonomy, whose fundamental objective is to guarantee impartiality, ethics, transparency and efficiency in electoral processes (article  of the Constitution). The exercise of this power takes place through its executive body, the CNE, which, in the current process of trade union re-legitimization, is nothing other than the technical facilitator of the autonomous electoral power, aimed at guaranteeing the transparency and impartiality of the process, in accordance with the constitutional mandate set forth in the Eighth Transitional Provision.
.The Government adds that in order to carry out its constitutional mandate, the CNE has drafted a transitional Special Statute providing for the renewal of the trade union leadership, following consultations with the trade unions involved in the process, without disregarding the rights of these organizations, which freely formulate their by-laws and internal regulations, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Moreover, section  of the Statute in question refers specifically to the temporary nature of this Statute,  which will remain in effect until a ruling is handed down on the appeals lodged by the persons concerned in connection with the corresponding elections'  The Government emphasizes that this Statute embodies the amendments proposed to the CNE by the trade unions in the process of dialogue.
.As regards the Government s response in the media to the recent strike in the petroleum industry on  and  March , the Government deplores the fact that the Federation of Oil, Chemical and Allied Workers of Venezuela (FEDEPETROL) called a strike in the country s key industry without having fulfilled the statutory requirements in order to ensure that the stoppage would be accompanied by the safeguards laid down by law. On the contrary, they bypassed all the legal procedures (submission of a list of demands, conciliation proceedings, determination of minimum services, among others) and called an ill-timed strike which entailed severe losses for the country. Therefore, given that this strike was illegal and highly detrimental to the entire population, it was predictable that the Government would deplore the attitude of the Federation backed by the CTV, especially since the same Federation had concluded with PDVSA Petroleo y Gas S.A. the best collective agreement ever signed in the history of the Venezuelan petroleum industry s  collective agreements and  years of negotiations with these social partners.
.As regards the Bills for the democratization of the trade union movement and for the protection of trade union guarantees and freedoms and trade union unification, the Government states that these have been forwarded to the trade union movement itself in its different confederations, which will decide in due course whether these Bills should be pushed forward and enacted into law, and will also decide as they see fit on the unity or diversity of the trade union movement.
.In a communication from the Government received",-1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
261,"during the Committee s meeting, the Government indicates that SIDOR and SUTISS, with the mediation of the Minister of Labour, reached an agreement, following which the pending issues were resolved unanimously.
.The Committee observes that when it examined this case at its June  meeting it had demanded that the Government take measures to: () repeal or substantially amend the trade union standards and decrees that are in violation of Conventions Nos.  and , adopted since the arrival of the new Government; and () withdraw the Bill for the protection of trade union guarantees and freedoms and the Bill for the democratic rights of workers, which contain restrictions to trade union rights that are incompatible with Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee also requested the Government to provide its observations concerning: (i) the allegations submitted by the CTV objecting to the Special Statute for the renewal of the trade union leadership issued by the National Electoral Council (CNE) and a resolution of the Comptroller-General s Office requiring trade union officials to submit a sworn declaration of their assets and criticizing the hostile statements made by the President of the Republic against the CTV following a strike in the petroleum sector; and (ii) the allegations presented by the ICFTU concerning the refusal of the SIDOR-Consorcio Amazonia enterprise to negotiate a collective agreement.
.As regards the Committee s recommendation to withdraw the Bill for the protection of trade union guarantees and freedoms and the Bill for the democratic rights of workers, the Committee notes that the Government states that the Bills in question have been forwarded to the trade union movement of Venezuela in its different confederations and that they will decide in due course on the advisability of adopting them and on the unity of the trade union movement. In this respect, the Committee recalls that it has already pointed out that the Bills in question contain restrictions to trade union rights and that they have also been the subject of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and recommendations. In these circumstances, the Committee strongly urges the Government to ensure that the Bills in question are withdrawn.
.As regards the Committee s recommendation on the need to repeal or amend the trade union standards and decrees that are in violation of Conventions Nos.  and  adopted since the arrival of the new Government, the Committee deeply deplores the fact that the Government has not communicated information on measures taken to this effect. In this respect, the Committee once again urges the Government to take the necessary steps without delay to follow up on its recommendation.
.As regards the allegations objecting to the Special Statute on the renewal of the trade union leadership issued by the National Electoral Council (CNE), the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the Constituent Power had provided in the new Constitution for what is termed the Electoral Power, aimed at guaranteeing impartiality, ethics, transparency and efficiency in electoral processes, and that the exercise of this power takes place through an executive body, the CNE; () the main objective of the CNE is to guarantee respect for the voters' will and for their right to participate directly in trade union affairs through free elections in which equality of treatment without any discrimination whatsoever is guaranteed, in a climate of impartiality, transparency and reliability of the electoral committees; and () the CNE drafted the Statute in question following consultations with the trade unions and after taking into account their proposed amendments, and that it is temporary in nature.
.In this respect, the Committee regrets to note that although in March  it urged the Government to put an end to the functions of the National Electoral Council (CNE) in respect of trade union elections, the CNE decided to enact the Special Statute for the renewal of the trade union leadership. Moreover, the Committee deeply deplores the fact that the CNE has felt obliged to enact the abovementioned Statute as a result of the outcome of the referendum carried out on  December  which resulted in the removal of elected trade union officials, despite the fact that this referendum had been criticized by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and recommendations at its November-December  meeting and that the Committee had urged the Government at its March  meeting to invalidate the results of the referendum. Moreover, the Committee observes that the Statute to which the CTV objects regulates in an excessively detailed manner the electoral process of trade unions and also provides for the establishment of an electoral register in the National Electoral Council with an updated list of the members of the trade unions, and that this information could be placed at the disposal of anyone interested. The Committee recalls that  the regulation of procedures and methods for the election of trade union officials is primarily to be governed by the trade union s rules themselves. The fundamental idea of Article  of Convention No.  is that workers and employers may decide for themselves the rules which should govern the administration of their organizations and the elections which are held therein' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ] and that the establishment of a register containing data on trade union members does not respect rights of personality (including privacy rights) and such a register may be used to compile blacklists of workers. In these circumstances, the Committee once again strongly urges the Government to put an end to the functions of the CNE that are established in the National Constitution and to repeal the Special Statute on the renewal of trade union leadership. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any steps taken in this regard. Moreover, if this Statute has been applied from the date of its promulgation to that of the examination of this case, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the trade unions which so wish may hold new elections governed by the provisions of their by-laws and without any interference whatsoever by the authorities or by bodies that have nothing to do with workers' organizations.
.As regards resolution No. -- of the Comptroller-General s Office of the Republic criticized by the CTV for requiring trade union officials to submit to the Office a sworn declaration of assets within  days of taking office and within  days of the date on which their term of office ends, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the Comptroller-General s Office of the Republic is a body that is functionally autonomous and even supervises the administration of the Government; () the resolution at issue does not require intervention by the Comptroller s Office in matters relating to the administration of trade union funds; and () as regards the resolution, there is a wide range of appeal procedures available to persons whose rights have been infringed, which have not been used by the complainant. In this respect, the Committee notes with concern that this resolution is discriminatory in nature, in that it is only applied to trade union officials. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that resolution No. -- of the Comptroller-General s Office of the Republic is repealed.
.As regards the allegation concerning the hostile statements made by the President of the Republic against the CTV and displaying favouritism towards the Bolivarian Workers' Force following a strike in the petroleum sector, the Committee notes that the Government states that it was logical for the Government to deplore the attitude of the Federation of Oil, Chemical and Allied Workers of Venezuela (FEDEPETROL), supported by the CTV, in calling a strike in the country s key industry without going through all the legal procedures (submission of a list of demands, conciliation proceedings, minimum services, etc.) and entailing severe losses for the country. In this respect, although it can understand the concerns expressed by the Government, the Committee cannot accept threatening statements by the authorities of the country. Moreover, the Committee observes with concern that this is not the first occasion on which the government authorities have made such statements against the CTV (see th Report, paragraph ). In these circumstances, the Committee deeply deplores the statements made to the media by the authorities in connection with the strike held by petroleum sector workers and once again urges the authorities to refrain from making threatening statements against the CTV or any other trade union affiliated to this Confederation.
.As regards the allegations concerning the refusal by the SIDOR-Consorcio Amazonia enterprise to negotiate a collective agreement, despite the fact that the trade union met the requirement laid down in the current collective agreement to deposit a draft new collective agreement with the Zona de Hierro labour inspectorate  days before the expiry of its term, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the parties have reached an agreement.
.The",1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
262,"Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that the Bill for the protection of trade union guarantees and freedoms and the Bill for the democratic rights of workers are withdrawn.(b) The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to take steps without delay to repeal or amend the trade union standards and decrees adopted since the arrival of the new Government that are in violation of Conventions Nos.  and .(c) The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to put an end to the functions of the National Electoral Council as it is established in the National Constitution and to repeal the Special Statute on the renewal of trade union leadership. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any steps taken in this regard. Moreover, if this Statute has been applied from the date of its promulgation to that of the examination of this case, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the trade unions which so wish may hold new elections governed by the provisions of their by-laws and without any interference whatsoever by the authorities or by bodies that have nothing to do with workers' organizations.(d) The Committee strongly urges the Government to ensure that resolution No. -- of the Comptroller-General s Office of the Republic, which requires trade union officials to submit a sworn declaration of assets at the beginning and end of their term of office, is repealed.(e) The Committee deeply deplores the statements made to the media by the authorities in connection with the strike held by petroleum sector workers and once again urges them to refrain from making threatening statements against the CTV or any other trade union affiliated to this Confederation.(f) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case.
.The Committee first examined this case at its March  meeting when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in March ].
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  March and April . The Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) sent new allegations in communications dated  and  April, and  May , respectively.
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the Government s reply, and in particular the agreements reached by the trade union confederations, including the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), aimed at democratizing the trade union movement as part of a process which would open the way to trade union elections, in which the workers would take decisions and the Government, according to its statement, would remain neutral. The Committee nonetheless deplores the fact that according to the new allegations the sense of these agreements has been distorted, given the interference by the authorities in the process of trade union elections and the new restrictive provisions, as well as the hostile statements made by the President of the Republic with regard to the CTV and the favouritism shown to the Bolivarian Workers' Force, according to the CTV s latest allegations. The Committee urges the Government to cease its harassment of the CTV and to ensure that the authorities refrain from interference in the trade union electoral process, and that it abandon the idea of imposing trade union unity. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the CTV s allegations of  and  April .
.The Committee concludes that the Government has not changed its attitude with regard to trade union matters and that the situation prevailing at the time of the previous examination of the case in March  is continuing to deteriorate; the Committee must also emphasize its previous recommendations on the need to repeal or substantially amend the standards and decrees referred to in its previous recommendations and the new provisions restricting trade unions' right to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. Moreover, although it notes the Government s statements to the effect that the consultative referendum of  December  was conducted in accordance with the Constitution, the Committee requests the Government to refrain in future from holding referendums on matters directly affecting the trade union movement, disregarding the will of the trade unions and their confederations.
.The Committee observes that the allegations relating to collective bargaining in the oil sector and the transfer of SINOLAN officials have been resolved (a collective agreement has been concluded in the oil sector and no complaints by the SINOLAN trade union are pending).
.The Committee requests the Government to provide its observations concerning the allegations submitted on  May  by the ICFTU.
.The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legal aspects of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee reiterates its previous recommendations and demands that the Government take measures to repeal or substantially amend the trade union standards and decrees that are in violation of Conventions Nos.  and , adopted since the arrival of the new Government. The Committee also demands that the Government take steps to withdraw the Bill for the protection of trade union guarantees and freedoms and the Bill for the democratic rights of workers, which contain restrictions to trade union rights that are incompatible with Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee urges the Government to cease its harassment of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), and to ensure that the authorities refrain from interference in the trade union electoral process and from displaying favouritism with regard to the Bolivarian Workers' Force, and to abandon the idea of imposing trade union unity.(c) The Committee requests the Government to refrain in future from carrying out referendums on matters directly affecting the trade union movement, disregarding the will of the trade unions and their confederations.(d) The Committee requests the Government to provide its observations concerning the new allegations submitted by the CTV ( and  April ) and the ICFTU ( May ).(e) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of the case.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) ( February,  August and  and  December ), the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) ( August,  September and  November ), the Trade Union of National Assembly Legislative Workers (SINOLAN) ( November ) and the Trade Union Federation of Communications Workers of Venezuela (FETRACOMUNICACIONES) ( November ). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) supported the CTV's complaint. The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May ,  January and  February .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February  the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) expresses its concern about the passing by the National Assembly of a number of Decrees allegedly intended to guarantee freedom of association; ICFTU indicates that the situation of emergency in the country which was declared by the National Assembly, was used as the grounds for it to legislate a series of measures that flagrantly violate ILO Conventions Nos.  and . The ICFTU expresses its sincere appreciation for the ILO's efforts to resolve this situation by immediately sending a mission which was able to appoint a joint committee responsible for reaching agreement on the terms of the Decrees under preparation. Regrettably, the agreements were not respected and the Decrees passed are not compatible with the rights contained in Conventions Nos.  and .
.In its communication of  August , the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) alleges that on  June  the Federation of Oil, Chemical and Allied Workers of Venezuela (FEDEPETROL), affiliated to the CTV, and the Venezuelan Federation of Workers of Hydrocarbons and their Derivatives (FETRAHIDROCARBUROS) presented the Ministry of Labour with a draft collective agreement to be negotiated with PDVSA Petrleo y Gas S.A., a public trading company which acts as the Venezuelan industrial parent or holding oil company. The negotiations were initiated on  September  at the Ministry of Labour. In addition to the trade unions that had signed the draft agreement, the meeting was also attended by the National",1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
263,"Trade Union of Petroleum Industry and Allied Workers (SINTRAIP). On  October  at the offices of PDVSA Petrleo y Gas S.A., the trade union organizations (FEDEPETROL, FETRAHIDROCARBUROS and SINTRAIP) agreed to join forces in the negotiation of the collective agreement. Subsequently, on , , , , , , ,  and  October ; , , , , , , ,  and  November ; ,  and  December ; and, lastly, ,  and  January , at the offices of the PDVSA, negotiations were conducted and agreement reached on the draft agreement which gave rise to the process. On  November, at the Ministry of Labour, the parties signed an agreement relating to aspects that had been controversial during the negotiations, more specifically the system of social benefits and the scope and implementation of the provisions of the collective agreement to employees of contractors.
.The complainant goes on to state that, despite this agreement, on  January  a Decree was approved by the National Assembly and published in Official Gazette No. , of  March , ordering the suspension of discussions of collective recruitment by Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. and authorized the National Executive to establish the conditions to govern collective recruitment in the National Public Administration. On  January , PDVSA Petrleo y Gas S.A. unilaterally and in apparent compliance with the contested Decree, which was not published on the date it was passed (..), suspended negotiations. The complainant specifies that the Decree in question has the following objectives: () to bring the industrial relations framework into conformity with prevailing constitutional provisions; () to maintain and gradually improve the standard of living of workers; and () to respond to the emergency situation prevailing in the country declared by the National Assembly. Section  of the Decree suspends negotiations on the basis of the alleged emergency declared by the National Assembly. However, no reference is made to the regulatory instrument in which this declaration was issued and consequently the Decree was based on a false supposition which constitutes sufficient grounds for it to be declared entirely invalid, which is in fact what was requested in the actions of unconstitutionality lodged with the Supreme Court of Venezuela, copies of which were attached to the complaint. To date, no decision has been handed down concerning these actions, nor on the interim protective measures requested of the court in both cases to make it immediately possible to exercise the right to bargain collectively and to freedom of association.
.In effect, the suspension of the right to bargain collectively, being an essential and inalienable element of a fundamental human right - freedom of association - and one of the specific and appropriate ways to improve workers' living conditions, could only have as a material cause an event of the magnitude of a declaration of emergency, which presupposes a serious economic crisis and the material impossibility of the Republic to provide the basic fundamental needs of its workers. This hypothesis did not occur and the Decree had repercussions on a constitutional right on the basis of false and non-existent grounds. Also, section  of the Decree authorizes ""the National Executive to establish the conditions to govern the collective recruitment of the National Public Administration, both centralized and decentralized, including state enterprises in accordance with prevailing constitutional provisions"". In this way, the Decree:- assumes and determines that the negotiation of the collective agreement that will govern the conditions of work of national petroleum industry workers is suspended following a decision by a public authority agency, in violation of the right to collective autonomy enjoyed by the parties and, in addition, of the principle of non-interference which governs the fundamental human right of freedom of association;- weakens the right to collectively bargain working conditions in the National Public Administration, both centralized and decentralized, and grants the National Executive the authority to ""establish the conditions to govern collective recruitment"", including in state enterprises governed by private law;- lastly, it revokes ""all the legal and regulatory provisions that are contrary to this Decree"" (section ) meaning that it ceases to apply or revokes, as appropriate, the entire collective bargaining system established in the Labour Code in keeping with the Constitution and the international Conventions validly signed by the Republic on the right to the voluntary collective bargaining of working conditions.
.The complainant explains that the Decree issued by the National Assembly is dated  January  but was published in the Official Gazette on  March , that is over one month later when, as is publicly and widely known, a dispute resulting in a strike of oil workers broke out. Another Decree of the same date approved the ""measures to guarantee freedom of association"". The legal basis of the Decree in question is derived from (according to its heading) section  of the Statutes Governing the Operation of the National Assembly on the one hand, and on the other, by the only section in the Decree which pronounces the reorganization of all the public authority agencies, passed on  August  and published in Official Gazette No. , of  August . The introductory clauses to the Decree specify as follows:(a) ""that Venezuela is a founding member of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and as such has accepted the principles and rights set forth in its Constitution and has committed itself to making every effort to achieve the general objectives of that Organization"" (No. );(b) that freedom of association is one of the fundamental rights established in the national Constitution and that our country has ratified ILO Conventions Nos.  and  ""which contain, inter alia, guarantees of the right of workers to establish without previous authorization, organizations of their own choosing, to join or to leave them and to elect their representatives, without interference from the public authorities (' "" (No. );(c) ""that article  of the Constitution of Venezuela confers constitutional status on treaties, covenants and conventions concerning human rights ratified by Venezuela and declares them to have priority application (' "" (No. );(d) ""that the emancipation of workers should be through their own efforts and therefore it is for them to decide to eliminate flaws and bring about a radical change of attitudes, conduct and behaviour that will lead to a new culture of trade union action"" (No. );(e) ""that the progress and well-being of workers is linked to the strength of their trade union organizations, to the honesty and legitimacy of their leaders and to the level of independence that these organizations have from the State, from the employers and from political organizations"" (No. ).
.Nevertheless, in contravention of the above clauses, of standards with constitutional status, of international Conventions relating to the fundamental human right of freedom of association which has constitutional status in Venezuela, and of the Labour Code, the amendment of which is not the responsibility of the National Assembly, the Decree in question:- provided for the constitution of a ""National Trade Union Electoral Commission made up of four representatives from each of the national workers' confederations: the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the Single Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CUTV), four from non-affiliated trade unions, four from the New Trade Unionism (NS) and four from the Workers' Constituent Front (FCT). This Commission will guarantee that free, democratic, universal, direct and secret elections are conducted to elect the executive officers of workers' organizations"" (section ) [the complainant states that the Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions (CODESA), a legal trade union confederation, is not included in the Decree, with no justification offered. In addition, two organizations not registered with the Ministry of Labour, as is obligatory, as trade union confederations or third-level organizations, namely ""the New Trade Unionism"" (NS) and ""the Workers' Constituent Front"" (FCT), are given the same representation rights as the registered trade union confederations, particularly the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), whose status as the most representative trade union confederation has been accredited by the national Government to the Conference of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in an uninterrupted fashion];- granted the Commission the authority to call a referendum to allow the workers to decide on trade union unity, making it clear in the same provision that ""if any trade union decides to remain on the margin of the process of trade union unification, it will automatically be excluded from the National Trade Union Electoral Commission"" (section );- ""The National Trade Union Electoral Commission will set the date for the elections, will notify the workers, will set up the polling stations which will be at their workplaces, except for cases of force majeure, will count the votes and will announce the names of those elected. Each list of candidates will have at least one witness for all electoral proceedings"" (section );- ""The electoral list or roll is made up of all active workers, retired and pensioned workers, employees, rural workers, professionals, scientists and intellectuals affiliated to trade union organizations, and the workers",0,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
264,"who become affiliated to them within a judicious period of time as determined by the National Trade Union Electoral Commission, which will resolve any refusal to become affiliated concerning its workers and trade union organizations (' "" (section );- ""The National Trade Union Electoral Commission will strictly comply with the provisions of article  of the Constitution of Venezuela. With regard to the sworn financial declaration, this must be submitted by the person concerned when he or she stands as a candidate for trade union representation or executive position and at the end of his or her term of office. In this connection, periodic reports must be presented to the workers about the administration of the property and resources of the organization and severe sanctions should be established against all unethical acts in the exercise of trade union duties"" (section );- ""The National Assembly will appoint three of its members, together with one member appointed by the National Electoral Council, to be responsible for the entire process of democratization and reunification of the Venezuelan trade union movement"" (section ).
.The complainant considers that the Decrees referred to expressly and directly violate ILO Conventions Nos.  and  and the Constitution of Venezuela:Article . All workers, without distinction whatsoever, and without the need for prior authorization, have the right freely to form trade unions that they consider to be appropriate in order to best defend their rights and interests, and to join or refuse to join these organizations, in conformity with the law. These organizations are not subject to administrative intervention, suspension or dissolution. These workers are protected against all acts of discrimination or interference contrary to the exercise of these rights. The officers and officials of the trade union organizations shall enjoy immunity in the exercise of their functions during the period of their mandate.For the exercise of trade union democracy, the by-laws and rules of trade unions shall include provision for alternation of officials and officers through a direct and secret ballot of all the members. The officials and officers who abuse the benefits associated with freedom of association for their personal wealth or interest will be punished in accordance with the law. The officers are required to submit a sworn statement of their financial holdings.Article . All workers, in the public and private sector have the right to voluntary collective bargaining and to conclude collective agreements with no further requirements than those established by law. The State shall guarantee their development and will take the necessary measures to promote collective relations and to resolve labour disputes. The collective agreements will protect all active workers, at the time of their signature and those who join subsequently.
.The Decrees also violate article .(a) and (c) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (), ratified by Venezuela, which reads:The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure:(a) the right of everyone to form trade unions and join the trade union of his choice, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, for the promotion and protection of his economic and social interests. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others;(c) the right of trade unions to function freely subject to no limitations other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..The CTV emphasizes that the constitutional status of the provisions quoted is the result of article  of the Constitution of Venezuela, which stipulates that: ""Human rights treaties, covenants and conventions, signed and ratified by Venezuela, shall have constitutional status and take precedence over internal legislation, to the extent that they contain standards that are more favourable than those established in the Constitution and national legislation. These treaties, covenants and conventions shall have immediate effect and are to be applied directly by the courts and other public bodies"".
.The CTV emphasizes that the constitutional status of the provisions quoted is the result of article  of the Constitution of Venezuela, which stipulates that: ""Human rights treaties, covenants and conventions, signed and ratified by Venezuela, shall have constitutional status and take precedence over internal legislation, to the extent that they contain standards that are more favourable than those established in the Constitution and national legislation. These treaties, covenants and conventions shall have immediate effect and are to be applied directly by the courts and other public bodies"".
.In its communication of  August , the ICFTU provides information regarding the intention of the top management of the enterprise Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), to refuse to recognize the collective bargaining process it is conducting with its workers. Following the Decree issued by the former National Assembly in which the process of collective bargaining was suspended between PDVSA and the sector's trade union organizations, the Federation of Oil, Chemical and Allied Workers of Venezuela (FEDEPETROL) lodged an action for constitutional protection before the Supreme Court and a number of trade union organizations, including the ICFTU, presented a complaint against the Venezuelan Government to the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association for the violation of ILO Conventions Nos.  and . Given that the period fixed in the Decree to resume negotiations on the agreement is about to end, the ICFTU notes that the conducting of trade union elections in the industry, one of the conditions mentioned in the Decree, has not been carried out. It should be specified that this election process, to which the trade union federations have at no time expressed any opposition, did not take place for reasons unrelated to actual trade union dynamics and even to the actual industry. Nevertheless, the top management of the enterprise, without the participation of the trade unions, nor of the Ministry of Labour, and without the supervision of the National Electoral Council (the only body authorized to carry out such assessments) undertook a ""consultation"" of its workers on a ""modern agreement"" which would replace the one currently under negotiation.
.The ICFTU indicates that the results of the consultation were announced and, according to the companies' officials, its proposal was approved by  per cent of participants, on the basis of which it is preparing to negotiate the new contract with its workers. However, the trade unions allege that the consultation was fraudulent. In addition, the legality and legitimacy of that consultation have even been questioned by the Ministry of Labour. For these reasons, the ICFTU rejects the use by the PDVSA of mechanisms which weaken the right to collective bargaining of its workers and the representativeness and legality of its trade union organizations.
.With its communication of  September , the CTV attaches some documents containing information of an aggressive and hostile nature from the authorities against the CTV, collected by various print media of Venezuela, as documentary proof in support of their complaint. This information indicates the participation of the President of the Republic in the activities of an allied organization, the Bolivarian Workers' Force, where he criticized the CTV.
.In their communications of  and  November , the CTV and the Trade Union Federation of Communications Workers of Venezuela (FETRACOMUNICACIONES) criticize the fact that the National Electoral Council prohibited for a third consecutive time the holding of trade union elections, the calling of a referendum of all the country's voters on whether to unify and re-legitimize trade union executive officers, the convening of a workers' constituent assembly (something that does not exist in legislation) and the first discussion approval by the National Assembly of a draft Bill for the protection of trade union freedoms and guarantees, which constitutes a flagrant violation of Convention No. .
.With its communication of  December , the ICFTU sent copies of letters from various trade union organizations (submitting complaints to the ILO) about acts which violate Conventions Nos.  and . These are summarized below:- The Workers' Federation of the State of Yaracuy (FETRAYARACUY), alleges that the National Electoral Council, made up of trained activists of President Chvez, for the third consecutive time prohibited the holding of trade union elections on the basis of regulations absolutely contrary to Convention No. , to legislation and the Constitution. The National Assembly, the overwhelming majority of which is controlled by the President of the Republic, called a referendum, the objective of which is to consult all the country's voters, including employers, students, housewives, the military, the unemployed, etc., on whether to modify, restructure, democratize and re-legitimize trade union executive committees and on the convening of a constituent assembly of workers, something which is non-existent in the country's legislation. In addition, the National Assembly, dominated by the coalition of President Hugo Chvez, approved following its first discussion the Bill for the protection of trade union freedoms and guarantees, and",-1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
265,"threatens to remove the existing trade unions and federations and replace them by a pseudo trade union body formed according to the image and usage of the Government and the President. This constitutes an offence against freedom of association, against the country's principal trade union confederation, the CTV, and against the entire Venezuelan democratic trade union leadership, who are being called bandits and corrupt, although to date no trade union leaders have been accused before the courts of justice or sent to prison. The CTV is a confederation which has been developing, introducing far-reaching changes in its organization, and which has achieved significant democratic advances and modernization in recent years. It is important to stress the severity of the situation, particularly the abuse of power and interference of the Government of President Chvez in the operation of trade union organizations and the control they have over the National Electoral Council, the National Legislative Assembly and the Supreme Court entities appointed through personal contacts.- The Union of Telecommunications Workers and Employees of the State of Yaracuy claims that Venezuela is experiencing a crisis of democratic values, manifestly designed to eliminate any institution or individual which disagrees with the opinion of the President of the Republic. The elimination of trade union structures is not exempt in this regard: with considerable difficulty they have become one of the very few strongholds to resist the merciless attacks of the political regime which is today oppressing the people, and the workers in particular. Interference in the affairs of workers and trade unions by this Government is simply unacceptable, and it is trying, by way of an unconstitutional referendum, to take possession of the executive committees of the trade unions and to undermine the rights to affiliation and to establish their own statutes; it is an insult to the respect of the most elementary human rights. The people, particularly the working class, suffer constant harassment intended deliberately to intimidate them so that they will not take to the streets to defend their sacred rights, leaving the trade union executive committees virtually isolated at this critical juncture.- The Trade Union of Workers in the Service of the Regional Executive of the State of Yaracuy rejects the acts of aggression and the impositions suffered by Venezuelan workers at the hands of the Government of President Hugo Chvez. With the authority given to it by the majority of the constituents of the National Assembly, the Government approved a trade union referendum to be conducted on  December  concerning a question that would invalidate all trade union organizations, from the CTV to the most humble trade union, and in which non-unionized citizens would also be entitled to vote. Furthermore, currently (at the end of ) the National Assembly is in the process of discussing a draft Bill for the protection of trade union guarantees and freedoms, sections  and  of which clearly establish the suspension of all trade union executive officers whose periods of office have been completed, as well as the fact that they may not be re-elected or occupy other positions within the organizations. This would invalidate all trade union executive committees (on three occasions, by way of resolutions issued by the National Electoral Council, the inspection body for all electoral processes, the head of which is appointed by the Chvez Government, the electoral processes were suspended for all workers' organizations). The aim of President Chvez is to eliminate the current trade union leaders and replace them with leaders attached to the Government; this is the objective of the referendum and of the passing of the abovementioned Bill, together with an orchestrated smear campaign directed by the President of the Republic himself, who has branded the CTV leaders as corrupt and dishonest.- The Trade Union of Civil Servants of the Government of the State of Yaracuy (SEPGEY) states that it is incomprehensible and unheard of for the Government of President Hugo Chvez to seek to conduct elections, including a referendum, to oblige the general public to give their views on a matter that only concerns workers, who are the ones who know the organization to which they belong; this violates the provisions of the statutes of each trade union organization, and also the Labour Code, as a worker must be affiliated to be entitled to vote. Furthermore, the political slant the Government has given to this referendum is clear, and this constitutes nothing less than a violation of all the standards, laws and constitutions that the country has had.- The Single Trade Union of Agricultural, RN (National Resources), National Park, Garden and Allied Workers of the State of Yaracuy indicates that the President of the Republic is calling a trade union referendum in which it wants all those registered on the standing electoral register to vote, thus violating the international agreements signed by Venezuela. This organization is not opposed to trade unions being made more democratic and brought up to date, as long as it is the actual organized workers themselves who appoint their own representatives.
.In its communication of  November , the Trade Union of National Assembly Legislative Workers (SINOLAN) alleges transfers of its leaders in violation of the prevailing collective agreement.
.In its communication of  December  the ICFTU alleges that the referendum of  December  imposed on the Venezuelan people by the Government of President Chvez is intended as a direct attack on the trade union movement elected according to the statutes and to do away with its leadership in order to make room for another movement more favourably disposed to the Government. On  November  an international trade union delegation began a mission in Caracas in a desperate attempt to persuade President Hugo Chvez to stop his plans to dismantle his country's trade union movement. The ICFTU explains that President Hugo Chvez is organizing this referendum - which will not be free and independent - in conjunction with the local elections, with the aim of dissolving the four principal trade unions of Venezuela and replacing them by a made-to-measure puppet organization to serve the Government's interests. The principal target is the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), which is the country's largest trade union confederation and which is affiliated to the ICFTU. Mr. Javier Elechiguerra, the Public Prosecutor of Venezuela, yesterday asked the country's highest court, the Supreme Court, to suspend the referendum of  December  on the grounds of unconstitutionality. He considers that the referendum ""is an attack on freedom of association and the right of citizens to participate in national affairs, as recognized in articles  and  of the Constitution of Venezuela"". The ICFTU fears that if President Chvez achieves his objectives, his actions will serve as inspiration for other anti-union governments. Recently, the President publicly attacked the leaders of the CTV, but as early as the beginning of August , President Chvez made known his plans with respect to the Venezuelan trade union movement, threatening to dismantle it - by way of legislation promulgated by the Assembly - and to dismiss all trade union leaders. The announcement led to an overwhelming protest by trade union confederations all over the world and caused the ILO to send its first mission to the country. On that occasion the draft legislation was abandoned, but President Chvez's plans resurfaced once again at the beginning of .
.The ICFTU considers that the referendum - which will be conducted in conjunction with the municipal elections - is contrary to the international Conventions ratified by Venezuela. In a declaration published in Caracas at the end of its visit to Venezuela, the members of an ICFTU international trade union delegation considered that the authoritarian actions of the Venezuelan Government ""constituted a serious threat to democracy"".
.In its communications of  May  and  January  the Government states with regard to the national trade union referendum that international Conventions are instruments which create legal obligations when they are ratified. In accordance with article ()(d), of the ILO Constitution, a State that ratifies a Convention commits itself to taking such action as may be necessary to make effective the provisions of the Convention. The obligation does not consist only of incorporating the Convention into national legislation, but also involves the need to ensure its application in practice. In accordance with Venezuela's constitutional provisions, ratified Conventions acquire the force of national law. The Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), adopted by the International Labour Conference at its st Session in San Francisco on  June , ratified by Venezuela on  September , published in Official Gazette No. ,, extraordinary edition, dated  September , is contained in article  of the Constitution of Venezuela.
.In the text submitted for the national trade union referendum in Venezuela on  December , the Government asked:Are you in agreement with the renewal of trade union executive officers over the next  days under the special statute developed by the electoral authority in accordance",0,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
266,"with the principles of alternation and universal, direct and secret elections, contained in article  of the Constitution of Venezuela, and that during this time the leaders of the trade union confederations, federations and central organizations established in the country be suspended from their duties?
.The Government indicates that, according to the provisions of clause  of article  of the Constitution of Venezuela, a popular referendum can be conducted as this is a matter of national importance. Articles , ,  and  of Convention No.  specify the rights of workers to establish trade union organizations, to join them, to draw up their own regulations and stipulate that their rights shall not be ignored, infringed upon or revoked by any law or administrative instrument. However, none of this is intended to disregard or infringe upon any agency of the Venezuelan public authorities, but rather seeks to ensure that these provisions are complied with in practice by establishing real freedom of association, which must be obtained by consulting the sovereign people, since the traditional trade union leadership has taken hold and strengthened itself in such a way as to prevent its removal through the ordinary channels of the exercise of the rights of the workers themselves. It is the duty of the Venezuelan Government to safeguard workers' rights and in particular to ensure that they can organize themselves freely without falling victim to freedom of association restrictions.
.The Government indicates that true freedom of association has not existed in Venezuela, because during the Fourth Republic the trade union movement was (and still is) monopolized by a leadership comprising senior officials from the parties that dominated the political scene in an authoritarian, exclusive and hegemonic manner, who imposed the rules of the game, making trade unionists instruments of the party leadership. This trade union leadership managed the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) as it pleased, shunned the true essence of trade union activities, turned its back on the interests of the working class and enriched itself illegally at the expense of that class, without international institutions and bodies taking an interest in condemning such wickedness and maintaining - on the contrary - a complicit silence. The aim of the referendum is for the Venezuelan people, the sole masters of their destiny, to decide whether this leadership remains or should make way for the establishment of democracy in the labour sphere of the country and to allow authentic, freely chosen leaders to assume the leadership of the organized working class. There is no intention to replace one trade union monopoly by another; the objective is to institute authentic freedom of association which, directed along organizational channels, will strengthen the workers, which will in turn serve as a guarantee of social peace for employers with social awareness, with the resulting increase in investment.
.The Government adds that it respects compliance with the international obligations contracted by the Republic but it is also the jealous guardian of sovereignty and the executor of the legitimately expressed will of the people. The referendum planned to decide the fate of the trade union leadership in Venezuela does not contravene the obligations contracted under international Conventions with the ILO nor any provisions of the prevailing national Constitution.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states that, during the last  years, the trade union movement has acted against the interests of its members: misuse of trade union interests in favour of individual and partisan interests; ignoring democracy in the trade union; signing collective agreements knowing that they could not respect them, in particular in the public sector; high trade union density in the public service, with workers signing up for the sole objective of being admitted to the public administration; partisan treatment and collusion with the public authorities; enormous accumulation of debt that has not been acknowledged in the previously signed collective agreements (from  to , the State owed its employees approximately $ million); in the private sector trade union membership is almost non-existent ( per cent); , members of grass-roots level trade unions and national unions are not affiliated to a trade union of a higher level due to the absence of the minimum conditions required of credibility, autonomy and independence in the face of individual interests, as well as a lack of suitability. For  years, the leaders of the CTV have benefited from millions of bolivars of financing from the administration, while leading twice towards the collapse of the Workers' Bank of Venezuela and other trade union enterprises, without ever considering the costs. Furthermore, the leaders of the CTV accepted amendments to the labour laws to the detriment of the working class, for example, with respect to compensation for termination of employment at the initiative of the employer, or concerning a shameful private social security system, which is contrary to ILO principles and to human rights in general. The CTV has distorted the reality before the ILO, leaving it to be believed that there is persecution in the absence of any proof (there has been no trade union leader persecuted, put under house arrest, or assassinated and no trade union has been made illegal). CTV also provided false information before the ILO's Fourteenth Regional Meeting of the Americas (Lima, August ).
.The Government also states that in the communication of  February , the ICFTU did not include the Decrees of the National Assembly and did not show that there is little respect for the agreement between the parties, and therefore has not proved a violation of freedom of association. In addition, the Government did not receive a copy of the ILO's request to the ICFTU to provide additional information and is not aware of any response provided further to that request.
.The Government indicates that in January  it presented a number of draft Decrees to the National Assembly on the issue of trade unions, which referred to earlier drafts concerning free trade union elections, democratization, and trade union unity, which were modified following discussions with workers. On this occasion, the transitional standards committee of the National Assembly had intervened to facilitate dialogue, while respecting the decisions of the trade unions, freedom of association and human rights.
.The Government provides details of the election process for the National Assembly and of the approval of a new draft Constitution in a referendum of  December . The Government cites the following provisions concerning human rights and freedom of association:Article . Human rights treaties, covenants and conventions, signed and ratified by Venezuela shall have constitutional status and take precedence over internal law to the extent that they contain standards that are more favourable than those in the Constitution and national legislation. These treaties and conventions have immediate effect and are to be applied directly by the courts and other public bodies.Article . Every person has the right by virtue of these human rights treaties, covenants and conventions ratified by the Republic, to file a complaint before the competent international body in order to ensure that the rights are respected.Pursuant to the procedures established in this Constitution and in the laws, the State shall adopt the measures necessary to give effect to the decisions of the international bodies referred to in this Article.Article . Workers, without distinction whatsoever, and without the need for prior authorization, have the right freely to form trade unions that they consider to be appropriate in order to best defend their rights and interests, and to join or refuse to join these organizations, in conformity with the law. These organizations are not subject to administrative intervention, suspension or dissolution. These workers are protected against all acts of anti-union discrimination or interference contrary to the exercise of their rights. Officers and officials of the trade union shall enjoy immunity in the exercise of their functions during the period of their mandate.For the exercise of trade union democracy, the by-laws and rules of trade unions shall include provision for the alternation of officials and officers, through a direct and secret ballot of all the members. Officials and officers who abuse the benefits associated with freedom of association for their personal wealth or interests, will be punished in conformity with the law. Officers are required to submit a sworn statement of their financial holdings.
.The abovementioned articles of the Constitution (articles ,  and ), as well as the limits imposed by the National Assembly by the provisions approved through the national referendum of  April , constitute a guarantee that the National Assembly cannot act contrary to international Conventions that have been ratified by Venezuela, under threat of such acts being declared null. In addition, in the spirit of participation, dialogue and consensus, the National Assembly had been invited to propose and adopt the Decree on the measures to guarantee freedom of association.
.According to this Decree, the Government states that the transitional standards committee of the National Assembly launched a process of consultation on  January  with representative organizations of workers, namely the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), the General",-1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
267,"Confederation of Labour (CGT), the Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions (CODESA), and the Single Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CUTV). Also demonstrating respect for pluralism, participation and representativeness, without any favouritism, and in a true expression of democracy, full rights to participate in the deliberations and the decision-making process (accepted by CTV, CGT, CUTV, CODESA) were given to the representatives of New Trade Unionism (NS) and the Workers' Constituent Front (FCT), as well as to representatives of unions that were not affiliated to the confederations, the latter having a degree of independence compared to the traditional confederations, and giving an indication of the diversity and the degree of complexity of the Venezuelan trade union movement in the last  years.
.The transitional standards committee committed itself to guaranteeing free and democratic elections, by direct and secret ballots of all the members in order to elect new trade union leaders.
.The objective of the National Assembly, which was agreed by all the workers' representatives concerned, and has been demonstrated since all these representatives participated fully and without pressure from the Government or the National Assembly, established agreements based on democracy and credibility of the trade union movement.
.In order to expand the dialogue, the transitional standards committee of the National Assembly invited the ILO multidisciplinary team based in Lima to provide comments on the draft Decree concerning the democratization of the trade union movement. During the meeting of  January , the trade unions present and a number of important constituents laid the foundations for an agreement. The parties reached an agreement on  January , after discussing the process of democratizing the trade union movement, which involved the CTV, CGT, NS and FCT, laying the foundations for a Decree on the democratization of the trade union movement: measures to guarantee freedom of association, adopted by the National Assembly on  January  and published in Official Gazette No. , on  March .
.A comparison of the draft Decree sent to the ILO by the transitional standards committee, which was commented upon by experts from the International Labour Standards Department, and the Decree adopted and published on  March, illustrates that the differences in the version published in the Gazette were motivated by the process of dialogue and the agreement signed  January  between the various trade union organizations. This agreement sought to incorporate the advice of the ILO in order to avoid foreseeable interventions by the supervisory bodies and to initiate consultations with the most representative workers' organizations.
.The Government indicates that, as a result of an error of the secretariat, CTV was entitled to have three of its representatives as members of the Electoral Council, while the rest of the trade unions were allotted four members, due to section  of a Decree adopted by the National Assembly but which was not published in the Official Gazette. In the context of the continual pressure being exerted on the Government of Venezuela by the international organizations, due to unfounded allegations of violations of freedom of association against the National Assembly and the Government, the Director-General of the ILO, Mr. Juan Somavia, contacted the Minister of Labour, Mr. Lino Antonio Martnez Salazar, to express his concern regarding the abovementioned Decrees which could violate the principles of freedom of association. As a result of this contact, the Minister immediately had an inquiry undertaken in an attempt to find solutions through dialogue, in conformity with international obligations assumed by the Republic through the abovementioned Conventions, and in accordance with the policy of the present Government which has been in power since  February . Thus the decision was taken to suspend immediately the publication in the Official Gazette of all Decrees, and not to publish the Decree on trade union matters in order to determine whether there were any elements of the agreement concluded on  and  January  between the various trade unions that had not been incorporated.
.As additional evidence of the Government's goodwill, and of its concern for the CTV, a meeting took place between the representatives of the CTV, the Director of the National Legislative Committee, the Minister of Labour and former members of the National Assembly on  February, with various working groups seeking alternatives to bring about a consensus regarding the problematic provisions of the Decree that had been approved by the National Assembly. The ICFTU had previously submitted the complaint to the ILO (Case No. ). In this context, the Secretary-General of the CTV expressed his satisfaction with the suspension of the said Decrees as well as the amendment to section  of the Bill on the measures to guarantee freedom of association, elaborated in conformity with the consensus reached between all the trade unions on  January . This illustrates unequivocally that the consensus was accepted by the representatives of CTV, CGT, CUTV, NS and FCT, as well as other trade unions not affiliated to these federations.
.On  and  February, following the request of the Director-General of the ILO and with the consent of the Government, a mission to the country was undertaken, consisting of Mr. Victor Tockman, Director of the ILO Regional Office for the Americas, Mr. Daniel Martnez, Director of the ILO Andean Multidisciplinary Advisory Team and Mr. Horcio Guido, Freedom of Association Specialist of the International Labour Standards Department based in Geneva. The mission had constructive meetings with the Minister of Labour and other competent authorities, reiterating at every opportunity their intention to find appropriate solutions within the framework of the widest possible dialogue, as was the case in the formulation of the  articles of the Constitution. During these meetings, the authorities sought to place the Decree on the measures to guarantee freedom of association in its proper context and the legislative and executive authorities reaffirmed that the publication of this Decree would justly reflect the process of democratization and re?legitimization of the public and social sectors, having no precedent in the history of the Republic, and from which the trade union movement, as an important sector of society, should not be excluded; the Decree would facilitate respect for pluralism and national and universal standards and democracy, through the process of direct participation of the country's workers. Due to the wide consensus reflected in the document signed on behalf of all the sectors on  January , the said Decree would open the way for a new legitimization of the trade union movement and mark the beginning of true democracy for the movement.
.It is odd that the ICFTU submitted a complaint on  February  against the Government of Venezuela alleging violations of freedom of association while meeting in Europe with the President of the CTV, Mr. Federico Ramrez Len, which was why he was not involved in the agreements of  and  January. Eight days prior to the ICFTU submitting the complaint to the ILO, representatives of CTV, namely Mr. Carlos Navarro, Secretary-General, Mr. Emil Guevara, Director of Human and Trade Union Rights, Mr. Pablo Castro, Executive Committee member, and Mr. Freddy Iriarte, Director of Hiring and Disputes, signed the framework agreement.
.Even more striking is the support on  August  of Mr. Carlos Navarro, Secretary-General and Pablo Castro, Executive Committee member of CTV, thus involving CTV in the complaint, after a delay of five months, but more significantly, after these persons had signed the framework agreement that led to the National Assembly adopting the Decree on measures to guarantee freedom of association.
.As undeniable proof of the consensus reached between the trade unions on  January and signed on the th of the same month, resulting in the Decree on the measures to guarantee freedom of association, the Government points to the most significant paragraphs of the opinions given by the representatives of CTV, CUTV, CGT, NS, FCT, CODESA and the document read by the Vice-President of the National Assembly leading up to the debate and the adoption of the trade union agreement signed on behalf of CTV, CGT, NS and FCT on  January .
.As can be drawn from the documentation submitted by the Government, in the context of the issuance of the National Assembly's Decree on the measures to guarantee freedom of association, there were various national trade union federations that were not in agreement with the imposition of a single trade union confederation. Some indicated that there was a need for more ethical trade unionism; others were of the view that the process of reform should be led by the affiliates and not by the entirety of the workers, reaching an agreement through a nationwide consensus. One organization objected to the carrying out of a single electoral process. A new trade union federation was extremely critical of CTV and of the fact that the same trade union leaders have been holding power for - years, amassing fortunes unjustly (at least one federation was of the view that there should be an investigation into these matters). There is consensus among all the federations as to the need for trade",-1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
268,"union reform, democratization, modernization and more ethical trade unionism. One federation has advocated for the inclusion of unorganized workers in the process. The federations requested technical assistance and logistical support from the National Electoral Council. The Government asserts that the trade union federations signed an agreement and that CODESA abstained from signing the approved draft Decree. The Government adds that everything previously indicated was not carried out due to the lack of agreement on the part of the various trade unions concerned after the Decree was adopted. This failure was also due to the acute interest of the trade unions in putting individual partisan concerns ahead of the interests of the working class, despite the efforts of the National Assembly and the Government. As a result, and as desired by the trade union movement, the Decree on the measures to guarantee freedom of association, which was adopted by the National Assembly on  January and published in Official Gazette No. , of  March , has never been, nor will it ever be, applied due to the disagreement among and conduct of the trade union organizations concerned.
.The Government states that on  October  the collective agreement for the petroleum sector was filed, due to the conciliation efforts of the Ministry of Labour following a dispute, including a strike, which ended in the signing of an agreement on  October . The Government emphasizes its intention to comply with Conventions Nos.  and .
.The Committee notes with grave concern the severity of the allegations submitted in this case: () the enactment of Decrees and regulations which, according to the complainants, violate Conventions Nos.  and  and the existence of Bills which seriously restrict the rights contained in those Conventions; () the convening and conducting of a referendum by the authorities to impose trade union unity, remove all trade union leaders and replace the existing trade union confederations by an organization more favourably disposed to the Government, in the establishment of which the latter has played a major role; () the conducting of a campaign by the authorities to harass, discredit, injure and intimidate the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), the most representative trade union confederation, with the intention of destroying it as well as the other confederations; () the prohibition to hold trade union elections for the third consecutive time; () the suspension of collective bargaining in the oil sector and the carrying out of ""consultations"" directly targeting workers about working conditions with the aim of concluding a ""modern agreement""; () the granting of powers to the executive authority to establish the conditions to govern collective recruitment in the public sector; () the transfer of trade union leaders from SINOLAN in violation of the collective agreement.
.The Committee must firstly deplore the fact that the Government has not replied to all the allegations.
.The Committee notes the Government's declarations that: () the trade union movement continues to be monopolized by a leadership comprised of senior officials of the parties that dominated the political scene in an authoritarian, exclusive and hegemoneous manner, who made sure that the trade unions were the instruments of the party leadership; () this trade union leadership managed the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV) to suit its purposes, shunned the true essence of trade union activities, turned its back on the interests of the working class and enriched itself illegally at the expense of that class; () it is for the Venezuelan people (and this is the purpose of the referendum) to decide whether this leadership should stay or go; () there is no wish to replace one trade union movement by another but rather to institute authentic freedom of association; () the referendum of  December  was undertaken within the framework of the Constitution. The Committee notes the communication of  February  in which the Government strongly criticizes the trade union movement and its leaders for corruption over the last  years. The Committee also observes that the Government submits that the complainants have not proven the allegations and did not even deem it necessary to forward the relevant Decrees. However, the Committee recalls that this case involves allegations concerning relatively recent measures in violation of freedom of association, that the Government has been sent all the complainants' communications, and that the text of the Decrees of the National Assembly are public documents. The Committee considers that the objective of the reform of the trade union movement, with which, according to the Government, the trade union federations were in agreement, is not to be undertaken through measures that are incompatible with Conventions Nos.  and .
.The Committee points out that, in the face of government criticism of the trade union movement, when the members of a trade union organization consider that their organization is turning its back on their interests, they have at their disposal in all free and democratic societies various means to express their disagreement: they can cease their membership of the organization, elect new leaders, amend their trade union statutes, or dissolve the organization. The Committee recalls that, according to Articles  and  of Convention No. , workers shall have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing and these organizations (through their members) shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities, while the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right. Therefore, observing the content of the referendum of  December , the Committee cannot accept the authorities taking steps to change the trade union leadership because, according to Convention No. , it is not their responsibility to do so, particularly as the referendum decided on by the authorities and encompassing all voters (not only trade union members) involves the indiscriminate suspension of the leaders of all trade union central organizations, federations and confederations, and the principle of alternation, that is to say the impossibility of these leaders to continue in their positions in the future.
.The Committee deplores this situation which is all the more reprehensible as the authorities have also made a large number of anti-union statements to the media in conjunction with this process, including remarks of an aggressive and hostile nature against the CTV which cannot fail to have a threatening effect and which are of a generic nature, without, as the complainants indicate, there currently being any proceedings against or sentences involving trade union leaders. Similarly, in view of the supposed neutrality of the Government's aims in respect to the referendum, the Committee observes that, according to the documentation and press cuttings provided by the complainant, the President of the Republic took part in the open days of the Bolivarian Workers' Force (FBT), an emerging new movement allied to the Government, from where it attacked the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), in such way that everything appears to indicate that the hostilities towards the CTV are closely linked to favouritism towards the FBT. Moreover, this forms part of actions taken by the public authorities for the purpose of unifying the trade union movement as expressly stated in the Decree of  August . The Committee considers that the situation described is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and stresses that the referendum mentioned constitutes a major violation of these principles. In the view of the Committee, the fact that the Government indicates that the trade union federations that had been party to the agreement, subsequently reversed their opinion concerning the legislating of trade union reform, in no way alters this conclusion.
.Furthermore, the Committee deplores that the authorities have prohibited trade union elections for the third consecutive time, that in violation of Article  of Convention No.  they have suspended collective bargaining in the oil sector for several months citing an alleged state of national emergency (although following the dispute a collective agreement was signed on  October ) and that the companies are seeking to negotiate directly with workers in the absence of their trade unions. The Committee also deplores the lack of respect shown by the authorities to the ICFTU delegation that visited the country at the end of November .
.The Committee draws the Government's attention to certain principles and in particular stresses that ""by according favourable or unfavourable treatment to a given organization as compared with others, a government may be able to influence the choice of workers as to the organization which they intend to join"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ] and that the pressure placed on workers by the authorities by means of public statements made against a trade union violates Article  of Convention No. . In any event, unity within the trade union movement should not be imposed by the State through legislation because this would be contrary to the principles of freedom of association [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Instead it is the workers' organizations which should determine the structure of",1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
269,"the trade union movement, it being inadmissible that non-affiliated workers are permitted to participate in changes to that structure.
.The Committee also wishes to strongly emphasize that it is the responsibility of the workers' and employers' organizations to determine the conditions of election of their leaders and the authorities should refrain from any undue interference in the exercise of the rights of workers' and employers' organizations freely to choose their representatives, as guaranteed by Convention No. .
.This being the case, and taking into consideration the conclusions noted above and the fact that no response has been provided concerning certain allegations, the Committee urges the Government and the authorities to put an end, without delay, to the repeated violations of Conventions Nos.  and  that are occurring in the country and in particular:
.With regard to the allegations related to legislation, the Committee has noted this and fully supports the observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at its December  meeting which are reproduced below:The Committee notes with concern that the new Constitution of the Republic, of December , contains a number of provisions which are not in conformity with the requirements of the Convention, as follows:- Article . ""The constitution and rules of trade union organizations shall require the alternation of executive officers by means of universal, direct and secret suffrage."" The Committee recalls that, by virtue of Article  of the Convention, workers' and employers' organizations shall have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules, and to elect their representatives in full freedom. In this respect, the imposition of the requirement for the alternation of trade union executive officers by legislative means constitutes an important obstacle to the guarantees set forth in the Convention;- Article . The electoral authority shall have the functions of: organizing the elections of trade unions, occupational associations and political organizations under the terms set out in the law; Eighth Transitional Provision. While awaiting the enactment of the new electoral laws envisaged in this Constitution, electoral processes shall be convoked, organized, directed and supervised by the National Electoral Council (by means of a Decree published in the Official Gazette No. ,, of  March , respecting measures to guarantee freedom of association, the members of the Electoral Board were appointed and their functions determined, including the achievement of trade union unification or the resolution of issues respecting membership of workers' organizations). In this regard, the Committee considers that the rules governing the procedures and arrangements for the election of trade union leaders should be determined in trade union statutes and not by a body outside workers' organizations. The Committee also considers that the issue of trade union unity and the status of the members of trade unions should be determined by decision of trade union organizations and in no event imposed by law, since such an imposition constitutes one of the most serious violations conceivable of freedom of association.In these conditions, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend the constitutional provisions referred to above, and to repeal the Decree published in Official Gazette No. ,, of  March , respecting measures to guarantee freedom of association, and asks it to provide information in its next report on any measures adopted in this respect.Finally, the Committee also notes with deep concern the draft texts for the protection of trade union guarantees and freedoms, and the ""democratic rights"" of workers in their trade unions, federations and confederations, which contain provisions that are in violation of the guarantees set out in the Convention, as well as an agreement issued by the National Assembly to convoke a national trade union referendum on  December  with a view to the unification of the trade union movement and the suspension or removal of current trade union leaders, which implies a very serious interference in the internal affairs of trade union organizations, which is totally incompatible with the requirements of Article  of the Convention.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that in one of the Decrees issued by the National Assembly, the trade union movement is accused of the misappropriation of trade union finances and the authorities are ordered to investigate the offences and acts contrary to the morals and economic interests of the workers perpetrated by their leaders, with these authorities being able to establish the origin of the executive officials' wealth and order the necessary protective measures. In this respect, making value judgements against trade union leaders currently in office, charging them indiscriminately and generically with offences and immoral acts, and allowing investigations into the assets of any trade union to be carried out, are contrary to the presumption of innocence and reflect unacceptable harassment and cannot but intimidate trade union leaders. However, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, following the intervention of the Director-General of the ILO, a decision was taken to suspend with immediate effect the publication of the Decrees of the National Assembly, in particular the Decree concerning trade union matters. The Committee notes the Government's statement that the Decree concerning the measures to guarantee freedom of association (No. ,) of  March  has never been, nor will it ever be, applied since the trade union federations, after having agreed to the Decree before its adoption, retracted their approval.
.The Committee demands that the Government take measures to formally repeal or substantially amend trade union standards and Decrees that are in violation of Conventions Nos.  and , adopted since the arrival of the new government, which moreover, according to the complainants, were adopted without respecting the compromise to reach a consensus on the substance of said Decrees. The Committee also demands that the Government take steps to withdraw the Bill for the protection of trade union guarantees and freedoms and the Bill for the democratic rights of workers, which contain restrictions on trade union rights that are incompatible with Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee brings the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with grave concern the severity of the allegations and deplores the fact that the Government has not replied to all the allegations.(b) The Committee urges the Government and the authorities to put an end, without delay, to the repeated violations of Conventions Nos.  and  that are occurring in the country and in particular:",1,2000,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
270,".At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to inform it of any court rulings from the appellate court on the suspension, by the judicial authorities, of the administrative ruling legalizing the registration of the Trade Union of Congressional Employees and Workers ' New Trade Union Structures (SINTRANES) [see th Report, paras.  and ].
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the legal appeal by a rival trade union to annul the registration of SINTRANES expired on  January , as the rival trade union did not present any legal document to support its claim; this was established and concluded by the legal authority. SINTRANES has at no time ceased to defend its interests and to enjoy freedom of association and the problems arising in this case reflect inter-union conflicts.
.The Committee notes this information.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendation:  The Committee hopes that the Government will register the trade union SINTRANES as a trade union soon. It requests the Government to inform it of any court rulings that have been, or may be, handed down in future on the matter' [see rd Report, para. ]. The complainant had indicated that the trade union was registered in June , and the Government had stated that the judicial authorities had suspended the administrative ruling legalizing the union and it was now for the appellate courts to give a final ruling.
.In a communication dated  September , the Government had indicated that the matter was before the courts, and in its communication of  October  the Government recalls that the union had been registered on  June .
.The Committee regrets that the Government has given no further details on the legal status of this case. It urges the Government to supply this information and to communicate any court ruling that has been or may in future be handed down on this matter.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Congressional Employees and Workers - New Trade Union Structures (SINTRANES) dated  September . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the Trade Union of Congressional Employees and Workers - New Trade Union Structures (SINTRANES) states that on  May  the Ministry of Labour issued an award according to which, in view of the existing gap in legislation regarding the registration and legal recognition of trade union organizations representing employees of the legislative assembly, the Labour Inspectorate should recognize any unions which the officials in question might establish. On  June , the Labour Inspectorate in the federal district placed the trade union on the appropriate register. The complainant adds that on  June  it presented a collective agreement for discussion, after the legal representatives of Congress had been notified with a view to beginning talks. The complainant states that, in view of the impossibility of actually holding talks on the collective agreement and of the fact that available administrative procedures were exhausted, it applied to the courts for sanctions and for an order to resume talks.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that the National Legislative Council (formerly the Congress of the Republic) indicated that it did not acknowledge the alleged link between itself as an employer and members of SINTRANES, since a court ruling of  October  by the Ninth Labour Court of the Caracas metropolitan area had suspended Administrative Ruling No. -- of  June  by the Labour Inspectorate of Libertador municipality in the federal district granting legal recognition to SINTRANES. This ruling followed an application by the Trade Union of Congressional Employees (SECRE) and others to overturn Administrative Ruling No. --.
.The Government adds that the former Congress of the Republic, as an employer, is not a party to the proceedings initiated by its workers' trade unions related to it (SECRE and SINTRACRE for the clerical and office workers and SINOLCRE for the manual workers) aimed at overturning the administrative ruling which established SINTRANES as a legal entity. This is thus an inter-union dispute in which the employer cannot assume powers which are not rightfully its own. The employer in this particular case is within its rights not to enter into talks with the supposed trade union until a competent court rules on the matter, in this case, the Ninth Labour Court of the Caracas metropolitan area and the corresponding appeal court which must hear the case either de oficio or at the request of the lower court. Furthermore, the main problem with legal recognition of the trade union SINTRANES Congreso lies in the fact that Congress employees can regard themselves as public servants; their terms and conditions of employment are governed by the personnel statutes of that institution which were approved in  and, where there is any gap in these provisions, by the Act respecting the administrative service (ley de carrera administrativa) and its implementing regulations. These instruments are subject to the legal principles established in section  of the Organic Labour Act; consequently, the administrative service is governed, first, by the statutes already referred to, and, secondly, by the Organic Labour Act.
.The Government states that the former Congress never discussed a collective agreement with this supposed trade union organization since by the time of the court ruling, the conciliation talks on the proposed collective agreement for congressional employees had been suspended, and Congress, in accordance with section  of the Organic Labour Act, at the first conciliation meeting convened by the labour inspector made allegations and argued that such talks were inadmissible, basing its arguments on the provisions of section  of the Organic Labour Act according to which employers are required to negotiate collective labour agreements with the trade union which represents the absolute majority of the workers in their sector. The supposed trade union SINTRANES Congreso does not have, and has never had, the attributes of a trade union at all, let alone an absolute majority of workers, white collar or manual, which would give it the authority to negotiate with the employer on the proposed collective agreement supposedly presented by the referred trade union organization; the legitimate trade unions of the former Congress are SECRE (Trade Union of Congressional Employees), SINTRACRE (Trade Union of Congressional Workers), and SINOLCRE (Trade Union of Legislative Workers of Congress).
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organization claims that, under the terms of a ruling by the Ministry of Labour, it was placed on the official register of trade union organizations; that subsequently, on  June  it presented a collective agreement for discussion; and that from then onwards there were attempts to obstruct talks on that agreement.
.In this regard, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement to the effect that: () it does not acknowledge any link between the complainant and the former Congress (currently the National Legislative Committee), since the courts in  suspended the administrative ruling which had legalized the trade union SINTRANES, following an application to the court by other trade union organizations in the sector. That court ruling has been the subject of an appeal and a final ruling has yet to be made; and () the former Congress has never discussed a collective agreement with the complainant, since the latter does not have and has never had the attributes of a trade union organization, let alone the authority to represent the absolute majority of workers in this specific sector.
.With regard to recognition of the complainant as a trade union, the Committee recalls that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , all workers without distinction whatsoever have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing without previous authorization, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, and that ""All public service employees (with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police, as indicated in Article  of Convention No. ), should, like workers in the private sector, be able to establish organizations of their own choosing to further and defend the interests of their members"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th (revised) edition, , para. ). The Committee hopes that the Government will register the trade union SINTRANES as a trade union organization soon. It requests the Government to inform it of any court rulings that have been, or may be, handed down in future on this matter.
.As regards the allegation regarding obstacles encountered by the complainant in its attempts to negotiate a collective agreement, it is the Committee's understanding that the right of collective bargaining can be exercised only when the trade union in question has been registered and only in as much as it is sufficiently representative, and",1,1999,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
271,"it declines at present to draw any other conclusions on the matter.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee hopes that the Government will register the trade union SINTRANES as a trade union soon. It requests the Government to inform it of any court rulings that have been, or may be, handed down in future on the matter.",1,1999,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
272,".In its previous examination of the case in November , the Committee made the following recommendations concerning the pending allegations [see th Report, para. ]:- The Committee requests the Government to endeavour to promote the negotiation of a collective agreement between the Trade Union of Public Employees of the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (SEPIVIC) and the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (IVIC) and to keep it informed in this regard.- As regards the allegation concerning the delay in issuing a ruling on the appeal lodged by the SEPIVIC against the administrative decision of September  ordering termination of the bargaining process between the trade union and the IVIC, the Committee deplores the time that has elapsed without a decision being issued by the authorities and trusts that a ruling will be handed down on this appeal in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final decision of the administrative authorities in this respect.- The Committee invites the complainant to furnish comments in respect of the new Regulations under the Organic Labour Act of  January  which regulate collective bargaining in the public sector.
.In a communication dated April , the SEPIVIC indicated that the Ministry of Labour had not yet handed down a ruling on the appeal it had lodged.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government sent a copy of the ruling dated  April  in which the Minister of Labour (responsible official) declared the appeal lodged by the trade union SEPIVIC to be valid and urged the parties involved to begin the discussions relating to the draft collective agreement.
.The Committee takes note of the administrative ruling dated  April  which urges the parties to begin the discussions relating to the draft collective agreement and requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of negotiations. The Committee observes that the complainant organization has not provided any comments in respect of the new Regulations under the Organic Labour Act (which regulate collective bargaining in the public sector) despite having been invited to do so, and it will therefore not continue its examination into this matter.
.The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Public Employees of the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (SEPIVIC) dated  October .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the Trade Union of Public Employees of the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (SEPIVIC) states that on  October  it initiated the application procedure for the negotiation of a collective agreement, with the aim of regulating the conditions of employment of public servants employed in the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (IVIC). The application process proved to be extremely complicated and slow, given that once the draft collective agreement has been submitted to the Directorate of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs, it has to be transmitted to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, which in turn sends it to the Central Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President of the Republic (CORDIPLAN), which then sends a request for information to the public agency directly involved in bargaining, in this case the IVIC. The bargaining procedure is governed by Decree No. , which sets forth partial regulations under the Organic Labour Act for the negotiation of collective agreements of officials or employees in the national public administration, and was published in Official Gazette No. , dated  June . The phase described above lasted a total of nine months from the date on which the collective agreement was submitted to the date of the first meeting between the trade union organization, the agency involved and the Public Prosecutor's Office.
.The complainant adds that following this lengthy waiting period, the IVIC, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the trade union held their first meeting in the collective bargaining procedure on  July , at which the IVIC stated its refusal to initiate collective bargaining, alleging that CORDIPLAN had produced a technical/financial report which indicated that this agency did not have sufficient budgetary resources for  to deal with or cover fully or in part the aspirations set forth in the draft collective agreement. Moreover, as regards the financial commitments that would be made under the collective agreement, it pointed out that this would require the prior approval of the President of the Republic, through the Council of Ministers, in accordance with section  of the Organic Labour Act. Lastly, it stated that its refusal to negotiate was in conformity with section  of the abovementioned Decree No. , i.e. the technical and financial requirements laid down by the Executive for collective bargaining. At the same meeting, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic unilaterally imposed the requirement that:the parties may negotiate the clauses of the draft agreement that do not deal with financial aspects, as it will be for the Executive to lay down the directives in this area. Final approval of the clauses that have been negotiated will be subject to the submission of a financial study by the IVIC quantifying the benefits granted, which will be revised by CORDIPLAN, which will give its approval if it considers it to be within the technical and financial limits laid down by the Executive, failing which it will order the relevant adjustments to be made. All of the above is in conformity with section  of the partial regulations made under the Organic Labour Act mentioned above.
.The complainant points out that the arguments put forward by both the IVIC and the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, in the case of the IVIC, led to the obstruction of the exercise of the right to collective bargaining and, in the case of the Public Prosecutor, subjected the content of bargaining to previously and unilaterally decided parameters, and to control or powers of veto that infringed the voluntary and free nature of bargaining, which means that the validity and effect of agreements were made conditional on prior approval by the Government. Faced with the above, the complainant denounced the fact that the conduct of the government authorities violated and infringed ILO Conventions Nos.  and . The initial position of the IVIC and the complainant led to a dispute which should have been settled by the Ministry of Labour. On  September  the Directorate of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs issued Administrative Decision No. , pursuant to its competence to settle the dispute that had arisen between the parties with respect to whether or not to continue collective bargaining. This decision only takes into account the arguments put forward by the IVIC and the other official bodies involved (the Public Prosecutor and CORDIPLAN), ignoring the allegations and defence put forward by the trade union, including that relating to the violation of international labour standards. The decision is based on the conclusions drawn by a report previously carried out by CORDIPLAN, citing the IVIC's insufficient budgetary resources; it states that the report is in conformity with the guidelines and directives issued by the Executive for negotiating conditions of employment with public servants; and it infers in advance that the commitments laid down in the collective agreement would exceed the IVIC's financial capacity. This is based on sections ,  and  of Decree No. ; it also declares that it is unlawful or impossible to pursue the collective bargaining process for which the application had been made nearly a year earlier. In other words, the Ministry of Labour ordered that the collective bargaining process be terminated.
.The complainant alleges that the free and voluntary nature of collective bargaining, as well as the obligation to encourage and promote the exercise of this fundamental right, have been infringed as follows: () the Public Prosecutor's Office, as director of the bargaining process and Attorney-General of the Republic, imposed the condition at the first stage of the bargaining process that financial clauses would be excluded from the discussions and any resulting agreements at the outset. It points out that it will be the Executive which will unilaterally determine the aspects of the agreement on this subject. It also points out that the clauses agreed on will be subject to financial studies carried out by the IVIC and final approval will be given by CORDIPLAN, which will be able to make any adjustments it sees fit to make in order for the agreement to be effective and valid. This initial position on the part of the Public Prosecutor's Office constitutes an imposition, since to oppose it would initially mean paralysing the bargaining process, since it is not possible to conclude any agreement or sign any minutes in the bargaining process that have not been drafted by the Public Prosecutor's Office; () the IVIC, as the agency",-1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
273,"directly involved, cites financial and budgetary reasons in order to refuse a priori to negotiate conditions of employment. In disregard of good faith, the IVIC requests that the bargaining process be declared inadmissible and that the Ministry of Labour terminate it, thus preventing the continuation of the bargaining effort, the application for which has lasted nearly a year. According to the complainant, the position taken by this official body presupposes that the collective agreement in any case includes clauses with a financial impact, overlooking the fact that the parties to bargaining may agree voluntarily and freely to postpone discussion of these clauses and focus initially on discussing and approving other contractual provisions relating to relations between the parties (union clauses), occupational safety and health, or others with a social content that do not involve any expense or that have only a slight or very limited impact on the budget; and () the Ministry of Labour, through the Directorate of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs, when settling the dispute between the parties, upheld the IVIC's claim and ordered that the bargaining process be terminated, on the basis of a study previously carried out by CORDIPLAN citing alleged insufficient budgetary resources. Along the same lines, it considers that to continue bargaining would violate the directives and technical and financial requirements issued by the Executive, which were allegedly included in the report drawn up by CORDIPLAN. According to the complainant, the position taken by the Directorate of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs constitutes a violation of the obligation to encourage and promote the exercise of the right to collective bargaining and also violates this right, since its decision has led to the termination of the process for which application had been made in .
.Lastly, the complainant states that the Executive, through the partial regulations governing the negotiation of collective agreements of officials or employees in the national public administration, carried out a series of acts of intervention with regard to the matters that are or have been the subject of collective bargaining, including the requirements and budgetary commitments undertaken in the course of bargaining. Under these provisions, the effect of agreements concluded by the parties in the process of collective bargaining shall be subject to or conditional on prior approval by the Public Prosecutor's Office and CORDIPLAN. Firstly, provision is made for control over the substance or content itself of the clauses of agreements by the Public Prosecutor in his capacity as moderator and director of the bargaining process. Pursuant to this, the agreements concluded by the parties have no validity, since their definitive form is shaped by the Prosecutor's declaration of conformity which must be imperatively recorded in each of the minutes drawn up in the process. Secondly, once the ""definitive agreement"" has been reached by the parties and the power of control mentioned above has been exercised, the Public Prosecutor submits the collective agreement to CORDIPLAN. This agency has the task of carrying out budgetary or financial control within a -day time limit starting from the date on which the agreements were received. This control takes the form of a binding or mandatory report containing a financial assessment of the agreements, a determination of the cost involved, the differences between the terms of the agreement and existing conditions of employment, and a conclusion to the effect that the terms of the agreement do not exceed the technical and financial requirements and limits previously fixed by the Government. According to the complainant, the control exercised by CORDIPLAN, in addition to constituting an obstacle to the bargaining process, implies a clear power of prior approval of collective agreements, since the effect of an agreement is conditional upon the issuance and notification of a report on the conformity of the agreements with the directives and policies formulated by the Government as part of its economic and social programme.
.Lastly, the complainant indicates that, in the case of collective agreements of public employees or officials, in addition to the procedures and powers of control granted to the Public Prosecutor's Office and CORDIPLAN, the Council of Ministers may, under section  of the Organic Labour Act, intervene in turn by approving or withholding approval from the scope of agreements with a financial impact if they commit public funds for more than two periods or years, which means in practice that all collective agreements have to be submitted to this body of the Executive, since under the labour legislation agreements shall be valid for not more than three and not less than two years.
.In a communication dated  April , the complainant provides a summary of the administrative steps taken since  with a view to negotiating a collective agreement and of the obstacles it has encountered along the way, culminating in the administrative decision of September  referred to in the communication containing the complaint, which ordered the termination of the bargaining process between the trade union and the IVIC. Lastly, the complainant states that it has lodged an administrative appeal against this decision but that no decision has been handed down by the administrative authority six months after this action was initiated.
.In its communication of  October , the Government indicates that, under section  of the Organic Labour Act, Venezuelan labour jurisprudence provides the possibility for the parties concerned in the collective bargaining process to put forward, at one single and specific moment -- the first meeting officially convoked by the labour officer -- the allegations and defence which it considers appropriate to propose to exclude itself from negotiating the given draft collective agreement. It is for the labour inspector to decide on the merits of these arguments. The creation and recognition of this distinct route relates to whether it is a question of collective contracts in public sector enterprises or whether they are in the private sector. Far from signifying a discrimination or a violation of the voluntary character and free negotiation of collective agreements, it is rather a matter of guaranteeing and procuring the conclusion and subsequent signing of the collective agreement by the State in a conscious and responsible manner. Any other approach would certainly amount to a disrespect for, and even an impairment of the rights of workers wishing to establish their working conditions, or even to modify existing agreements, through a legal instrument of a contractual nature (collective agreements), where prior verification of draft collective agreements is necessary and should be done by the Central Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President (now the Minister of Planning and Development) in order to determine the technical and financial resources within the National Executive for ensuring this agreement, before the definitive signing.
.In respect of the allegation concerning Administrative Decision No.  of  September  issued by the Directorate of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs, the Government indicates that this request had been dealt with in the correct channels in accordance with Venezuelan jurisprudence; it concerns an administrative act and as such may be handled either administratively or through the courts and in either case the requirements of the Act are fulfilled. The Government adds that Venezuelan jurisprudence effectively provides under section  of the Organic Labour Act for the possibility of verifying any eventual opposition to the commencement of discussions on a draft collective agreement. In the present case, it follows from what was expressed by the complainant that the employer's representation (IVIC) opposed in a timely fashion the initiation of discussions concerning the draft presented by the SEPIVIC union.
.The Government indicates that, at the same time -- the first conciliation meeting -- the Public Prosecutor urged the parties to the discussion and negotiation of the draft collective agreement to leave aside the discussions concerning any clauses of an economic nature; these would be finally approved by the Central Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President (now the Minister of Planning and Development). This declaration, according to the complainant, signifies submitting the contents of the negotiations to previously and unilaterally determined parameters, thus conditioning the validity and force of the agreements which had been arrived at by the parties. According to the Government, Venezuelan jurisprudence in force at the time of the negotiation of the draft of the collective agreement in question provides for a distinct treatment of proposals to establish working conditions for officials or employees in the National Public Administration.
.The Government indicates that Presidential Instruction No.  on Collective Bargaining in the Public Sector recognizes the impossibility for the employer representation to sign a negotiated contract given their lack of knowledge of the economic and technical report of the Central Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President, as well as for not having pointed out that the new economic agreement should not exceed the limits provided by the National Executive (section ). The Partial Regulations of the Organic Labour Act (Decree No. ) for its part provides that in the case where the Central",1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
274,"Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President determines that the proposed agreement exceeds the technical and financial limits set forth by the Executive, it should be returned to the parties so that they might make the necessary adjustments.
.The Government points out that the declaration of the Public Prosecutor according to which the parties should be able to discuss the presented draft with the exception of those clauses with economic consequences which should be approved by the Central Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President is logical; such a declaration does not signify a violation of the free and voluntary nature of negotiations but rather signals out the difference in the procedure for finalizing collective agreements in the public sector. The case being examined concerns an autonomous institution which given its special nature remains governed by the principles of budgetary controls which need to be established by the National Executive. This would be a different case if it were a question of a private enterprise which had the status of employer where the finalization of collective agreements solely and exclusively depends upon the employer's own situation, without the need to submit the approximate cost of a draft agreement for the approval of any entity; that would be a decision which could be determined in its own internal sphere of the private economic unit and thus would not be subject to principles of budgetary availability.
.The Government indicates that the new legal provision (the Regulations of the Organic Labour Act of January ) sets forth in Title III, Chapter III, Third Section, sections -, provides for one single procedure for collective bargaining, with certain peculiarities for, on the one hand, the National Public Centralized Administration which are the same for the autonomous institutions, foundations, associations and state enterprises and, on the other, the collective agreements which devolve from state governments and municipalities. It shall be noted that in both cases it is essential to take into account the technical and financial criteria, in the first case set by the President and the Council of Ministers and, in the second case, set by the Governor and Mayor. It shall also be pointed out that, in section :The state employer entity cannot sign the collective agreement until the report has been issued by the Central Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President of the Republic, wherein it can be noted that the agreement proposed does not exceed the technical and financial limits set out by the National Executive.Thus, all drafts of collective bargaining in the public sector will be covered by such regulations wherein fulfilment of respect for the abovementioned technical report is compulsory in order to be able to sign a new collective agreement. Nevertheless, section  provides that the collective bargaining process under way in the public sector at the time of the entry into force of these regulations will be covered by the Partial Regulations of the Organic Labour Act for Negotiating Collective Agreements of Officials and Employees in the National Public Administration or the abovementioned Presidential Instruction No. .
.In respect of the allegation concerning the non-fulfilment by the Government of the obligation to promote and encourage the exercise of free and voluntary collective bargaining ""by ordering through the Directorate of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs and by means of Administrative Order No. , the termination of the collective bargaining process"" and that the administrative authority in pronouncing itself with respect to this order simply limited itself to considering the arguments put forward by the enterprise and by the other bodies concerned (Public Prosecutor and CORDIPLAN), the Government states that, in conformity with section  of the Organic Labour Act, the labour inspector shall decide upon the arguments and allegations put forth by the employer representation for exclusion from discussing the proposed draft, by means of an administrative act (in the present case by Administrative Order), and any of the parties which considers that its rights have been violated by the decision taken by the labour official may, in accordance with the Act, appeal this decision.
.The Government points out that it would have hoped that the complainant would have put the legal machinery into motion in order to assure the balance between the subjects concerned in the negotiation process, in particular through an appeal of this administrative decision.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant alleges obstruction of the procedure for the negotiation of a collective agreement with the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (IVIC). Specifically, the Trade Union of Public Employees of the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (SEPIVIC) alleges the following: () the lengthy and complicated procedure of collective bargaining for public servants and the submission to different bodies of definitive collective agreements already concluded, with the possibility that they may be amended, with the signing of the collective agreement being prohibited until then and the need for final approval by authorities other than the employer; () the lack of good faith on the part of IVIC in refusing to negotiate clauses of a collective agreement that do not have a financial impact; () failure of the Directorate of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs to take account of the arguments put forward by the complainant in its decision of September  (Administrative Decision No. ) to settle the dispute between the SEPIVIC and the IVIC, ordering termination of the bargaining process; and () the delay in handing down a decision on the appeal lodged by the SEPIVIC against an administrative decision ordering termination of the bargaining process between the trade union and the IVIC.
.As regards the alleged slow and complicated procedure governing collective bargaining of public servants and submission to different bodies of definitive collective agreements already concluded, with the possibility that they may be amended, it being prohibited until then to sign the collective agreement, and the need for final approval by authorities other than the employer, the Committee observes that sections  to  of the partial regulations issued under the Organic Labour Act for the negotiation of collective agreements of officials or employees of the national public administration (Decree No.  of ) which applies in this case provide as follows:Section . A trade union or occupational organization intending to conclude a collective agreement with a body of the national public administration shall submit the draft agreement to the National Labour Inspector, who shall require and verify compliance with the requirements laid down in section  of the Organic Labour Act.Section . Once the draft collective agreement has been accepted, the National Labour Inspector shall forward a copy of it to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic and the body concerned.Section . The Public Prosecutor of the Republic shall request the public body to submit a comparative financial study drawn up in accordance with the standards laid down by the Central Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President of the Republic showing the costs involved in the current agreement or conditions of employment and in the proposed agreement and indicating the number of persons who are to participate in negotiations, who shall have extensive powers so that they may in no case allege that they have an insufficient mandate.Section . The Public Prosecutor of the Republic shall notify the organization concerned of receipt of the draft agreement and shall request it to appoint a committee to represent it in discussions, membership of which shall not exceed seven persons.Section . Discussions of collective agreements shall take place at the office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. Only in exceptional cases where due justification is provided may the Public Prosecutor authorize them in another location, provided that he, or a representative appointed for the purpose by him, shall be present.Section . The Public Prosecutor of the Republic or his representative shall set the times of discussions.Section . It shall be understood in any case that partial and final agreements reached by the representatives of the parties and of the Public Prosecutor shall be submitted to the latter for approval and this shall be recorded in the minutes of the discussions.Section . Once the parties have reached a definitive agreement, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic shall send the approved text to the Central Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President of the Republic so that the latter may, within  working days following the date of receipt, carry out a financial study of the agreement and determine the cost involved in it and the difference with respect to current agreements or conditions of employment and shall verify that the commitment that has been negotiated does not exceed the technical and financial limits laid down by the Executive. The agreement cannot be signed until this report has been submitted.Sole paragraph. Where the report of the Central Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President of the Republic determines that the commitment exceeds the technical and financial limits laid down",1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
275,"by the Executive, it shall determine the adjustments necessary and return the text of the agreement to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, so that the latter may notify the parties so that they may make the necessary adjustments within  working days following the observations of the planning office and submit the revised and adjusted text of the agreement to the Central Coordination and Planning Bureau of the Office of the President of the Republic for approval.Section . The collective agreement shall be deposited with the General Sectoral Directorate of Labour of the Ministry of Labour, which shall send a copy to the Central Personnel Office.Section . Failure to comply either with the technical and financial instructions laid down by the Executive or with the present provisions by the persons involved in negotiation on behalf of the national public administration shall entail their liability in accordance with the law.
.The Committee observes that this procedure which applies, may be followed by a further administrative procedure before the Council of Ministers, since the second paragraph of section  of the Organic Labour Act provides that: ""Collective agreements involving payments in budgetary periods beyond the one in progress must be approved by the Council of Ministers"" (according to the complainant all collective agreements must be submitted to this body, since the legislation provides that they shall be valid for not more than three and not less than two years).
.In this context, the Committee notes that the administrative procedure for negotiating a collective agreement in the public administration (covered by the partial regulations of  under the Organic Labour Act for negotiating collective agreements for officials or employees of the national public administration) may be extremely lengthy -- in this case the complainant alleges that nine months elapsed before the parties were able to begin negotiating -- and that the definitive agreement reached between the parties must be approved by one or two bodies, depending on the case (the Public Prosecutor of the Republic and possibly also the Council of Ministers).
.While the Committee is aware of the particular problems arising in collective bargaining in the public administration (for example, remuneration and other conditions of employment of public servants which involve a financial cost need to be reflected in public budgets subject to approval by bodies that are not always the employers of the public employees and whose decisions need to take account of the economic situation of the country and the public interest), it recalls that when examining allegations on this subject it has considered that, in so far as the income of public enterprises and bodies depends on state budgets, it would not be objectionable -- after wide discussion and consultation between the concerned employers' and employees' organizations in a system having the confidence of the parties -- for wage ceilings to be fixed in state budgetary laws (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). Moreover, the Committee has considered that it is acceptable that in the bargaining process the employer side representing the public administration seek the opinion of the Ministry of Finances or an economic and financial body that verifies the financial impact of draft collective agreements (see th Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Peru), para. ), provided that ""trade union organizations and the employers and their associations were consulted and could express their points of view to the authority responsible for assessing the financial consequences of draft collective agreements"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.Nevertheless, the Committee notes the Government's indication that the new Regulations under the Organic Labour Act of  January  (issued after the presentation of this complaint) regulate collective bargaining in the public sector. In these circumstances, the Committee invites the complainant to formulate its comments in this respect.
.As regards the allegation concerning the IVIC's lack of good faith in refusing to negotiate certain clauses of a collective agreement from the moment that the Public Prosecutor of the Republic excluded the clauses with an economic impact, the Committee regrets to note that the Government has not communicated its observations on this matter. In this regard the Committee recalls that ""it is important that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement; moreover genuine and constructive negotiations are a necessary component to establish and maintain a relationship of confidence between the parties"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to endeavour to promote the negotiation of a collective agreement between the Trade Union of Public Employees of the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (SEPIVIC) and the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (IVIC) and to keep it informed in this regard.
.As regards the allegation concerning the failure of the Directorate of the National Inspectorate and Collective Labour Affairs to take account of the arguments put forward by the SEPIVIC in its decision of September  ordering termination of the bargaining process (Administrative Decision No. ), the Committee notes the Government's statement that, in conformity with the Organic Labour Act, any of the parties which considers that its rights have been violated by the administrative decision may make an appeal. The Committee observes that the complainant indicates that it has appealed this administrative decision and that it emphasizes the delay in issuing a ruling on the appeal lodged by the SEPIVIC against the abovementioned decision. In this respect, the Committee deplores the time that has elapsed without a decision being issued on the matter and trusts that the authorities will hand down a ruling on the appeal in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final decision taken by the administrative authorities in this respect.
.Lastly, the Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee invites the complainant to furnish comments in respect of the new Regulations under the Organic Labour Act of  January  which regulate collective bargaining in the public sector.(b) The Committee requests the Government to endeavour to promote the negotiation of a collective agreement between the Trade Union of Public Employees of the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (SEPIVIC) and the Venezuelan Scientific Research Institute (IVIC) and to keep it informed in this regard.(c) As regards the allegation concerning the delay in issuing a ruling on the appeal lodged by the SEPIVIC against the administrative decision of September  ordering termination of the bargaining process between the trade union and the IVIC, the Committee deplores the time that has elapsed without a decision being issued by the authorities and trusts that a ruling will be handed down on this appeal in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final decision of the administrative authorities in this respect.(d) Lastly, the Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case.",1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
276,".The Committee examined this case at its November  and March  meetings, at which time it presented interim reports to the Governing Body [see th and th Reports, paras. - and -, respectively, approved by the Governing Body at its th and th Sessions (November  and March )]. Subsequently, the Government sent further observations in a communication dated  August .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with interest the statements of the Government and in particular that the complainant organization confirms the reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists and states that FUNDARTE has restored full enjoyment of trade union rights. The Committee concludes, therefore, that the issues that gave rise to the present case have been resolved.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in November ]. The Government subsequently sent new observations in communications dated  May and  November , and  and  February .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the questions still pending, the complainant had alleged that, following its registration with the Labour Inspectorate, the Federal District Foundation for Culture and the Arts (FUNDARTE) began a campaign of anti-union discrimination against its members. Specifically, the complainant alleges the following: () the dismissal of  trade unionists, including  with trade union immunity in October  and  others in February , and delays on the part of the administrative authority in resolving a petition for the reinstatement of the  workers with trade union immunity and the subsequent suspension of the reinstatements ordered by the administrative authority following legal action by the employer; () changes in the payment procedures and reduction of the wages of the members of the SINTRAFUNDARTE executive committee, the transfer of the SINTRAFUNDARTE secretary-general; and () refusal on the part of the employer to engage in talks with the executive committee in the context of favouritism towards another trade union organization, attempts to obstruct written communications from the executive committee to workers and threats of reprisals against workers who communicate with members of said executive committee [see th Report, para. ].
.The Committee formulated the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:- In respect of the allegations concerning the dismissal in October  of  unionists protected by trade union immunity and the subsequent suspension of their reintegration ordered by the administrative headquarters as a result of the judicial action taken by the employer, the Committee deplores the delay in the handling of this case and requests the Government to take steps to ensure the reinstatement in their posts of these  workers without loss of pay at least until the judicial authorities have made a definitive pronouncement on the subject. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in that respect.- In respect of the allegations concerning the changes to the conditions of payment (by cheque and not as done traditionally by means of a deposit in the bank account) and the cut in wages of the members of the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE, the Committee expresses the hope that the petition made by the complainant to the administrative authorities in this respect will be resolved in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of this petition.- As concerns the allegations of the transfer of the secretary-general of SINTRAFUNDARTE (Ivn Polanco), the Committee expresses the hope that the petition made by the complainant before the administrative authorities in this respect will be resolved in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of this petition.- The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations concerning the refusal of FUNDARTE to discuss with the executive board of SINTRAFUNDARTE within the context of favouritism towards another trade union and to keep the Committee informed in this regard.- The Committee urges the Government immediately to communicate its observations concerning the following allegations: () the dismissal of  SINTRAFUNDARTE members in February ; () the obstructing of written communications between the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE and the workers; and () the threats of reprisals against workers communicating with the members of the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE.
.In its communications of  May and  November  and  and  February , the Government states that the Ninth Labour Tribunal of First Instance of the Caracas Metropolitan Area on  June  handed down a definitive ruling on the appeal for annulment brought by FUNDARTE against the administrative ruling of the Labour Inspectorate dated  May  (No. ?). The administrative ruling in question had ordered FUNDARTE to reinstate a number of workers and pay the back wages owed to them. The Tribunal's ruling upholds the annulment of the administrative ruling and declares void all measures subsequent to  April , in particular the administrative labour proceedings for reinstatement and payment of back wages, and orders that the proceedings should revert to the stage of presentation of evidence. There were  such dismissals, not , as claimed by the complainant. Since the on-site inspection ordered by the ruling was carried out subsequently, and other action was taken in the proceedings in question, on  September  the Labour Inspectorate of Libertador Municipality (Federal District) issued an administrative ruling which dismisses the petitions for reinstatement and payment of wages on behalf of  former employees, on the grounds that nothing had been done to prove their claim of immunity. At the same time, the ruling upholds the petitions presented on behalf of  other workers, ordering FUNDARTE to reinstate them and pay the wage arrears owed to them. The Government attaches copies of the court ruling and administrative ruling in question. It also attaches two copies of the agreement on reinstatement and payment of wage arrears (,,. bolivars) of  October  which was signed between FUNDARTE and the said workers, in accordance with the administrative ruling mentioned above. According to FUNDARTE, the dismissals occurred in the context of a restructuring process from March  onwards.
.At the same time, in a communication dated  February , which the Government supplies, FUNDARTE claims that the allegation concerning the dismissal in February  of  trade unionists is false and no legal proceedings have been initiated in connection with them.
.As regards the complaint by SINTRAFUNDARTE concerning the transfer of a trade union official, irregular payment of wages by cheque and non-payment of a pay increase owed to seven trade union officials (despite the increase granted to other workers), the Government supplies a copy of the administrative ruling of  February , ordering FUNDARTE immediately to reinstate seven workers (trade union officials) in their previous posts and under the same conditions, with consequent payment of the wages owed to them from the time they suffered loss until their definitive reinstatement. However, the Government explains that it has not been possible to inform the employer of the administrative rulings in question, since the employer refuses to receive them.
.As regards the alleged refusal of FUNDARTE to enter into discussions with SINTRAFUNDARTE in the context of favouritism towards another trade union organization, the Government supplies an administrative ruling of  February  according to which FUNDARTE was not obliged to discuss the collective agreement proposed by SINTRAFUNDARTE, since the previous collective agreement signed by another trade union in  for a period of two years had not expired. According to FUNDARTE, the union SINTRAFUNDARTE enjoys the support of only  per cent of FUNDARTE workers and most of the workers belong to the other trade union, which has represented workers for the last five collective agreements since .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee invites the complainant to comment on the statement by FUNDARTE in which it denies the dismissal of  trade unionists in February .(b) Deploring the attitude of FUNDARTE in refusing to receive notification of the administrative rulings ordering payment into the bank accounts of seven trade union officials instead of payment by cheque and payment of wage arrears as a result of deterioration in their conditions of work, and overruling the transfer of a trade union official, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that the company receives the administrative rulings in question and complies with them.(c) The Committee regrets that the Government has not answered the allegations concerning: () attempts",0,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
277,"by FUNDARTE to obstruct written communications from the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE to workers; and () the threats made by FUNDARTE against workers who communicate with members of the SINTRAFUNDARTE executive committee. The Committee urges the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay.
.The complaint in the present case involves a communication from the Single Union of Workers of FUNDARTE (SINTRAFUNDARTE) dated  October . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  November  and  October .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the Single Union of Workers of FUNDARTE (SINTRAFUNDARTE) states that the Federal District Foundation for Culture and the Arts (FUNDARTE) is a Venezuelan State foundation dependent on the mayor's office of the Autonomous ""Liberating"" Municipality of the Federal District and that the municipal authority is competent to define the mandate of FUNDARTE. In Venezuela, workers of state foundations are covered by the sphere of application of the general labour legislation, meaning basically the Organic Labour Act.
.The complainant reports that on  September , a group of workers representing the absolute majority of FUNDARTE's staff presented to the Federal District Labour Inspectorate a request for SINTRAFUNDARTE to be entered into the trade union's register. It adds that the workers' group took the initiative in founding a union organization as a rebuff to the accords reached in the new collective agreement between the employer and the trade union representing the industry, of which they were members at that time; the complainant reports that the workers had rejected the employer's wage increase proposal unanimously and publicly at two general assemblies of members, but that the executive committee of the industry trade union had nevertheless accepted the proposed increase and decided to sign the collective agreement, flouting the democratic decision of its members and leading to mass resignations of membership.
.The complainant reports that on  October , the Federal District Labour Inspectorate entered the Single Union of Workers of FUNDARTE (SINTRAFUNDARTE) into the register and that from this date the FUNDARTE management began a policy of anti-union discrimination against the workers belonging to that new union, especially against the members of the executive committee, and likewise a policy of favouritism towards the industry trade union which retained membership among a minority of FUNDARTE's workers. Specifically, the complainant alleges that:-- On  October , FUNDARTE dismissed, in an arbitrary and unconstitutional manner,  workers belonging to SINTRAFUNDARTE in possession of trade union immunity. According to the complainant, this was a clear retaliation against workers who had decided to exercise their right freely to establish the organizations they considered appropriate. The complainant reports that proceedings relating to trade union rights are handled and decided by labour inspectors, who have to judge whether the reason for dismissal was just; those proceedings are governed by the Organic Labour Act, which requires them to be rapid, simple, free from formality, free of charge and accessible, yet in practice these proceedings do not ensure ""adequate protection"" against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of the workers' employment. In this connection, the complainant reports that: () the union officials in question lodged with the administrative authorities in November  a petition for re-employment and payment of wages due and that only on  May  was an administrative ruling issued declaring the invalidity of the dismissals and ordering re-employment and payment of the wages due to the affected union officials; the legal timescale for the decision was one month, but there was a large delay; and () FUNDARTE challenged the decision before Work and Labour Stability Tribunal No.  of Caracas Metropolitan Area, asked for the labour inspector's order on re-employment and wage payment to be declared void and at the same time asked for the order's effects to be suspended provisionally as a preventive measure until such time as the Tribunal took a definitive decision on the validity of the challenge. The Tribunal decreed the suspension of the labour inspection decision until it reached a decision on the substance of the matter; this could take one or two years because of the delays in the Venezuelan judicial system, leaving the affected workers without the protection provided for under Article  of Convention No. .-- In February , FUNDARTE dismissed, in an openly anti-union manner, another  workers belonging to SINTRAFUNDARTE; while they did not possess trade union immunity, three months had passed since the establishment of the new union.-- In February , FUNDARTE unilaterally altered the payment procedures for all members of the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE, deciding to discontinue payment by banker's cheque, the usual method in the organization, and to make payment by direct deposit into the workers' personal bank accounts, leading to extra operations and delays in salary payment. Subsequently, on  February , FUNDARTE went on to reduce unilaterally the wages of all of the SINTRAFUNDARTE managing committee members.-- Finally, on  March , FUNDARTE transferred to a different post in a different region Mr. Ivn Polanco, secretary-general of SINTRAFUNDARTE, who as such enjoyed trade union immunity. The complainant explains that the official in question was transferred to an office without sanitation, located in a very dangerous area where all workers' lives were at risk because of the high rates of violence and the lack of police presence.
.The complainant reports, in connection with the last claims (alteration of wage payment procedures, wage reductions and transfer of the secretary-general), that the members of the executive committee lodged actions with the Federal District Labour Inspectorate in March and April . It adds that although these proceedings should under the legislation take a maximum of approximately one month ( working days), no decision has been reached to date.
.According to the complainant, the dismissals by the employer from  October  to the present have affected only members of SINTRAFUNDARTE and are aimed at reducing the number of its members in order that it does not represent the majority of the workers and in order to benefit the industry trade union which signed the new collective agreement against its members' democratic decision. The complainant adds that the policy of favouritism pursued by FUNDARTE is also evidenced by the following:-- The employer has arbitrarily refused to fulfil its legal duty to deduct trade union dues from SINTRAFUNDARTE members' pay and forward them to its executive committee under article  of the Organic Labour Act, yet it has proceeded to deduct and forward dues for the industry trade union.-- The employer refuses to meet the SINTRAFUNDARTE executive committee in order to discuss the factors and decisions affecting its members and hear the union's complaints, but it continues to meet with the industry trade union and recognizes that union as representing also the members of SINTRAFUNDARTE.-- The employer prevents the SINTRAFUNDARTE executive committee from distributing written union communications to its members and the other workers, but does permit the other union freely to carry out such union tasks.-- The employer has threatened to dismiss, transfer or worsen the working conditions of workers meeting with or holding discussions with the members of the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE.
.The complainant declares that all of the allegations demonstrate on the part of FUNDARTE a clear policy of trade union favouritism against SINTRAFUNDARTE, implying a violation of ILO Convention No. .
.In its communication of  November , the Government declares that the complainant's accusation is centred around presumed acts of anti-union discrimination committed by the Foundation for Culture and the Arts (FUNDARTE), an administrative body dependent on the mayor's office of the Autonomous Liberating Municipality of the Federal District (municipal executive authority). The Government explains that the actions described in the report can in some way be imputed to the Government of Venezuela, since it is clear that, however those actions may be judged, they are the result of measures by the municipal executive under the autonomy recognized by legislation; however, the Government of Venezuela (the national executive) has exercised all of the measures legally granted it under its mandate to protect the complainant's freedom of association.
.In respect of the claim concerning a six-month delay by the Federal District Labour Inspectorate in deciding the petition ""for re-employment and payment of wages due"" lodged by a group of FUNDARTE workers, the Government reports that the petition for re-employment (or reinstatement in the previous post) is one of the mechanisms enshrined in Venezuelan labour legislation and guarantees the legitimate exercise of freedom of association through appropriate administrative proceedings substantiated and decided by a labour inspector. The subject of the petition for re-employment is expressly covered by section  of the Organic Labour Act, specifically for workers protected by trade union immunity who are subjected to dismissal, transfer or worsening of working conditions without the legally established authorization procedure having first been followed. It delimits the individual applicability of the standard in relation to",0,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
278,"those workers who are inalienable under the trade union immunity recognized by Venezuelan legislation in order to guarantee them full exercise of trade union activities.
.Thus, the protection of freedom of association enshrined in Venezuelan legislation is twofold, with an administrative and a judicial aspect. The first requires the direct participation of the public executive authorities through the Ministry of Labour as the organ of the national executive which represents labour administration. That administrative protection consists of verifying certain procedures provided for in the Organic Labour Act, such as: (a) the procedure for assessment of infringement (authorization to dismiss); and (b) the procedure for re-employment or reinstatement in the previous post. Both procedures are substantiated and decided by a labour inspector. The final procedure under the administrative protection measures is the ultimate expression of the labour administration organs' penal function, expressly recognized in the Organic Labour Act: ""section  -- Employers may not: ... Violation of these rules will be punished in the manner provided for by this law""; section : ""An employer who violates the legal guarantees protecting freedom of association shall be subject to a fine of not less than ...""; section : ""An employer who fails to comply with the order to re-employ definitively and securely a worker with trade union immunity ... shall be subject to a fine of not less than ...""; section : ""If the sanctions by fine as established in this Article cannot be applied, the violators shall be arrested and held for one day for each quarter of a minimum salary up to a limit of  days"". The powers of the labour administration extend as far as this.
.The second, judicial, element of protection is outside the control and direction of the administrative organs and rather part of the strictly judicial realm, managed by a different public authority.
.The Government states that one of the typical defence and protection mechanisms provided by the current labour standards can be seen in use in this case guaranteeing administrative protection. Specifically, a re-employment procedure was established, showing that the procedure enshrined in the legislation was applied and implemented effectively in order to protect through the administrative authorities the right to conduct trade union activity. Even the complainant admits this. The events, far from demonstrating a destructive attitude or violation on the part of the Government of Venezuela, show rather that the appropriate administrative procedures were applied to this case of workers invested with trade union immunity suffering infringement of their rights in the very course of exercising trade union activities. The sense of the administrative official's decision on the occasion of considering and proceeding with the petition submitted for re-employment or reinstatement in the previous post in no way relates to the objective of the procedure established in law; however, the effectiveness of this procedure lies not in a declaration that the claim is well founded, but in a verification of each and every one of the acts giving rise to it (and in any case the decision of the labour inspector was in this case favourable to the members of the complainant organization).
.Thus, the protection and assurance of ""adequate protection""referred to by the complainant are provided not by a declaration that the claim by the author of the petition ""for re-employment or reinstatement in the previous post"" is well founded, unless Venezuelan legislation recognizes -- as it does -- such a guarantee, expressly providing for the party which considers its trade union rights to have been infringed to have recourse to a labour administration organ in order properly to apply the re-employment procedure.
.Consequently, in accordance with the Organic Labour Act, once the re-employment procedure had been verified, an administrative act was issued in which the labour official declared the petition well founded and ordered the reinstatement of the plaintiffs to their posts and the payment of the wages due. Given all of this, it does not appear that there has been a violation by the Government of Venezuela of the workers' trade union rights.
.The Government states that the labour inspector's six-month delay in reaching a decision on the re-employment petition, claimed by the complainant to be a violation of Article  of ILO Convention No. , is, far from being such a violation, symptomatic of the real time for administrative proceedings in Venezuela; this situation is not in itself justifiable, but can be viewed with a certain tolerance in the light of its cause, which is related to structural problems of the Venezuelan public administration which there would be no sense in discussing in more detail. However, it is important to emphasize that the Labour Inspectorate before which the re-employment petition was brought was that of the Federal District, which, in view of its location and the territory it covers, receives the highest number of petitions. Nevertheless, without claiming this to be an excuse or still less a licence for such practices in future, it is an unfortunate fact of life which realistically means that six months is not in itself an excessive or strange delay. If the Venezuelan Organic Labour Act provides for a period within which the administrative body should provide a decision, this shows the legislator's intention that it should be provided as rapidly as possible; however, in this case, the high numbers of cases being submitted on a daily basis to the competent labour official make it impossible to fulfil this. In any case, beyond the stipulation of a period within which the petition should be considered, there is an ultimate obligation to process and decide the matter, which was fulfilled in this case.
.Concerning the complainant's claim that the labour inspector's administrative decision that the re-employment petition was well founded and the consequent order that the reinstatement of the workers in their posts were challenged by the employer before a court and that its effects were suspended provisionally as a preventive measure, the Government wishes to emphasize that administrative protection is not the only aspect of the system for protection of freedom of association in Venezuela. The second aspect, judicial protection, is enshrined in section  of the Organic Labour Act and, with relevance to the case under examination, reads as follows: ""The inspector shall reach a decision on the re-employment petition within eight working days of its submission. The decision is not subject to appeal, save that the parties retain the right of recourse to the relevant courts"". Thus, the official's decision may be challenged in court.
.In relation to this, it should be mentioned that the administrative decision by the labour inspector on the re-employment petition is an administrative act of a specific nature in that it is addressed to a particular person. The contents of that administrative decision issued by the Federal District labour inspector declaring well founded the petition for re-employment and payment of wages due draws by nature on the principles of administrative activity, which correspond to the limits and the discretion that belong to the administration. Thus, when FUNDARTE's legal representatives brought a legal appeal for annulment, they were making use of the resources which the law places at everyone's disposal for defence against actions by the public administration. The appeal process could not fail to take account of the labour administration's reasons in seeking to give effective protection to freedom of association. A labour inspector's actions in this respect could fail to be in accordance with the law and thus the affected party has every right to appeal against them.
.It is necessary also to examine the issue of the lodging of an appeal against an administrative act together with a request for the act's effects to be suspended provisionally as a preventive measure. This is a precautionary measure requested by one of the parties which by nature is a precautionary arrangement adopted by the judge in view of the risk or danger that the sentence might be overturned. It is clear that in the case in point, the judge, before granting the preventive measure as requested, naturally assessed its propriety and verified the real existence of the impending risk. In the present case, the suspension of the effects of the administrative act declaring the re-employment petition well founded was an autonomous decision made by the judge at the party's request and is also a means of defence and upholding of a right, though by the legal rather than the administrative route. The information supplied by the complainant would seem to indicate something strange about the measure taken by the judge, yet this precautionary measure is a typical means of protection and defence in the legal realm and is recognized in Venezuelan legal standards. Consequently, it is considered that both the re-employment petition and the challenge to the administrative act which resolved the petition are appropriate measures provided for under Venezuelan legislation and demonstrate the protection of freedom of association by the Venezuelan State.
.The Government concludes by declaring that it considers unfounded and inadmissible the supposed violations of workers' trade union rights alleged by the complainant.
.As concerns",-1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
279,"the dismissal of  members of SINTRAFUNDARTE, the Government states in its communication of  October  that the legal adviser of FUNDARTE (an institution falling within the Autonomous ""Liberating"" Municipality of the Federal District) indicates that these dismissals did not occur because of union membership but rather were the result of decisions taken by the Directors' Council and Executive Committee of FUNDARTE on the basis of Decree No.  of  June  concerning the process of restructuring the dependent entities of the municipality, approved by the city council of Caracas. The Government adds that out of the  employees dismissed by FUNDARTE,  had voluntarily indicated that they wanted to receive their social benefits in accordance with the administrative decision of  May  issued by the Labour Inspectorate of the Federal District. This means that the Government is now awaiting the tribunal decision concerning the reintegration and the payment of lost wages for the  workers who have decided to pursue their claims in court.
.As concerns the matter of whether the conditions for payment of wages to the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE were changed and whether their salaries were cut, the Government indicates that, according to the legal adviser of FUNDARTE, no such changes were made and the concerned persons had received a remuneration in conformity with the post which they occupied in the Foundation, just as everyone else in the institution.
.As concerns the secretary-general of SINTRAFUNDARTE, the Government indicates that he had indeed been transferred for reasons of service, from one administration to another, within the principal headquarters of FUNDARTE, Bldg. Tajamar, Pent House, Central Park, which according to the FUNDARTE legal adviser in no way worsened his working conditions.
.Finally, with respect to trade union dues, the Government states that they are no longer withheld from pay given that the administration of the internal affairs of FUNDARTE, through its personnel department, had not received any notification concerning the percentage which should be withheld, nor did it receive the necessary signed authorization from the members of SINTRAFUNDARTE in order to carry out the check-off referred to, but at no moment, as indicated by FUNDARTE, had the employer refused to discuss with the executive committee of the union.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant alleges that following its registration by the Labour Inspectorate, its members suffered a campaign of anti-union discrimination by the management of the Federal District Foundation for Culture and the Arts (FUNDARTE). Specifically, the complainant alleges: () dismissal of  union members --  in October  who had trade union immunity, and  in February  -- and delays on the part of the administrative authority in resolving both a petition for the reinstatement of the  workers with trade union immunity and a subsequent suspension of the said reinstatement ordered by the administrative authority as a consequence of legal action by the employer; () alteration of payment procedures and reduction of the wages of the members of the SINTRAFUNDARTE executive committee, the transfer of the SINTRAFUNDARTE secretary-general, and delays in the administrative processes launched as a result of those acts of anti-union discrimination; () failure to deduct trade union dues from SINTRAFUNDARTE members' pay; () refusal on the part of the employer to hold discussions with the SINTRAFUNDARTE executive committee within the context of favouritism towards another trade union, obstructing of written communications between the executive committee and the workers and threats of reprisals against workers communicating with the members of the executive committee.
.In respect of the allegation concerning the dismissal in October  of  union members enjoying trade union immunity and the subsequent suspension of the reintegration ordered by the administrative headquarters as a result of the judicial action undertaken by the employer, the Committee notes that the Government refers to  dismissals (while the complainant only refers to  dismissals) and indicates that: () the dismissals were not due to trade union affiliation but rather to the decisions made by the Directors' Council and Executive Board of FUNDARTE on the basis of Decree No.  of  June  concerning the process of restructuring of the dependent municipal entities; ()  of the dismissed workers voluntarily decided to receive the social benefits in agreement with the administrative decision issued by the Labour Inspectorate of the Federal District dated  May ; () the decision of the judicial authorities concerning the reintegration of and the payment of lost wages to the  workers who pursued their claims is being awaited; and () the judicial appeal against the administrative decision requested as a preventive measure the suspension of the effects of the decision and the decision taken was an autonomous one made by the judge at the party's request and is also a means of safeguarding and defending rights. In this respect, the Committee observes that while the Government indicates that the institution has stated that the alleged dismissals did not occur as a result of the union affiliation of the workers in question but rather in application of a  Decree concerning a process of restructuring, it also notes that these dismissals occurred one day after the registration of the complainant organization and that the administrative authority had ordered the reinstatement of the  dismissed trade unionists. In the circumstances, observing that the judicial authority provisionally suspended, until a decision was reached on the substance of the matter, the decision on reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists and payment of their outstanding salaries, and taking into account the time that had passed since the dismissals (which took place in October ), the Committee deplores the delay in the handling of this case and requests the Government to take steps to ensure the reinstatement in their posts of the  workers with trade union immunity, without loss of pay, at least until the judicial authorities have made a definitive pronouncement on the subject. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in that respect.
.With respect to the allegation concerning delays on the part of the administrative authority in resolving the petition for the reinstatement of the  dismissed workers with trade union immunity (the case allegedly took six months), the Committee notes the Government's declaration that: () on implementation of the procedure provided for under the Organic Labour Act for protection by the administrative authorities of the right to conduct trade union activities, the administrative authority ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and payment of the wages due; and () the six-month delay by the labour inspector in reaching a decision on the reinstatement petition was ""symptomatic of the real time of administrative proceedings in Venezuela, not in itself justifiable, but related to the structural problems of the Venezuelan public administration"".
.In this connection, the Committee observes that the Organic Labour Act provides in the case of dismissal of workers protected by trade union immunity for a procedure which should last no longer than  days (sections ,  and  of the Act). In the circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that any action brought before the administrative authorities relating to workers with trade union immunity is resolved in the period enshrined in the legislation.
.In respect of the allegations concerning the changes to the conditions of payment (by cheque and not as done traditionally by means of deposit in the bank account) and the cut in wages of the members of the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE, the Committee notes the Government's indication that, according to FUNDARTE, no such changes were made and the workers in question received a remuneration in accordance with the post they occupied in the Foundation. The Committee observes the complainant's indication that it petitioned the Labour Inspectorate of the Federal District on this matter in March  and that no decision has yet been rendered. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the administrative authorities will render a decision in this respect in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of this petition.
.As concerns the allegation of the transfer of the secretary-general of SINTRAFUNDARTE (Ivn Polanco), the Committee notes the Government's confirmation that his transfer occurred for service reasons, which according to FUNDARTE did not result in a worsening of his working conditions. The Committee notes the complainant's indication that it petitioned the Labour Inspectorate of the Federal District on this matter in April  and that no decision has yet been rendered. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the administrative authorities will render a decision in this respect in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of this petition.
.As concerns the allegation of the absence of check-off of trade union dues of SINTRAFUNDARTE members, the Committee notes the Government's statement that the dues were not withheld because the administration for internal affairs of FUNDARTE had not yet received any notification concerning the",-1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
280,"percentage to be withheld, nor had it received the necessary signed authorization from SINTRAFUNDARTE members. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that FUNDARTE proceeds with the withholding of the amount corresponding to the trade union dues and transfers it to SINTRAFUNDARTE as soon as it receives the required information in respect of the amount to be withheld, as well as the authorization of its members.
.Concerning the alleged refusal of the employer (FUNDARTE) to discuss with the SINTRAFUNDARTE executive committee within the context of favouritism to another trade union, the Committee notes the Government's indication that, according to FUNDARTE, at no moment did FUNDARTE refuse to discuss with the executive committee. In these circumstances, and noting the contradiction between the complainant's and FUNDARTE's versions, the Committee requests the Government to carry out its own investigation into the matter and to keep the Committee informed in this regard.
.Finally, the Committee urges the Government immediately to communicate its observations concerning the following allegations: () the dismissal of  SINTRAFUNDARTE members in February ; () the obstructing of written communications between the SINTRAFUNDARTE executive committee and the workers; and () the threats of reprisals against workers communicating with the members of the executive committee.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) In respect of the allegations concerning the dismissal in October  of  unionists protected by trade union immunity and the subsequent suspension of their reintegration ordered by the administrative headquarters as a result of the judicial action taken by the employer, the Committee deplores the delay in the handling of this case and requests the Government to take steps to ensure the reinstatement in their posts of these  workers without loss of pay at least until the judicial authorities have made a definitive pronouncement on the subject. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in that respect.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that any action brought before the administrative authorities relating to workers with trade union immunity is resolved in the period enshrined in the legislation (sections ,  and  of the Organic Labour Act).(c) In respect of the allegations concerning the changes to the conditions of payment (by cheque and not as done traditionally by means of deposit in the bank account) and the cut in wages of the members of the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE, the Committee expresses the hope that the petition made by the complainant to the administrative authorities in this respect will be resolved in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of this petition.(d) As concerns the allegations of the transfer of the secretary-general of SINTRAFUNDARTE (Ivn Polanco), the Committee expresses the hope that the petition made by the complainant before the administrative authorities in this respect will be resolved in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of this petition.(e) As concerns the allegation of the absence of check-off of trade union dues of SINTRAFUNDARTE members, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that FUNDARTE proceeds with the withholding of the amount corresponding to the trade union dues and transfers it to SINTRAFUNDARTE as soon as it receives the required information in respect of the amount to withhold as well as the authorization of its members.(f) The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations concerning the refusal of FUNDARTE to discuss with the executive board of SINTRAFUNDARTE within the context of favouritism towards another trade union and to keep the Committee informed in this regard.(g) The Committee urges the Government immediately to communicate its observations concerning the following allegations: () the dismissal of  SINTRAFUNDARTE members in February ; () the obstructing of written communications between the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE and the workers; and () the threats of reprisals against workers communicating with the members of the executive committee of SINTRAFUNDARTE.",1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
281,".At its March  meeting, the Committee recalled that firefighters (even if they are considered civil servants) must enjoy the guarantees provided for in Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Venezuela, and requested the Government to take measures to this end and, more generally, to conduct negotiations with the complainants to find a solution to the problems posed in various localities [see rd Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that the National Trade Union Association of Professional Firefighters, Auxiliaries and Related Workers of Venezuela (ASINBOMPROVEN) has presented a draft collective agreement which will be discussed with the Mayor s office. The Government also provides a copy of the ruling given by the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court of Justice which upheld the claim of invalidity lodged by representatives of the trade union regarding article (d), in fine, of the Decree concerning the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade. The Constitutional Division annulled actions that had been taken on the basis of the provision in question, which prevented members of the Eastern Joint Fire Brigade from being considered in the assessment process (to select employees on the basis of their qualifications and merits for entry into the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade) if they had previously been excluded from other fire brigades for disciplinary reasons.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting when it made the following requests [see st Report, paras. -]:Dismissals of unionized firefighters' The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the decision of the judicial authority on the question of the reinstatement of trade unionists Rubn Gutirrez and Juan Bautista Medina and payment of unpaid wages.Anti-union campaign to prevent the right of free association of firefightersin the Eastern Joint Fire Brigade, the Guacara, San Joaqun and MariaraFire Brigade Foundation, and the Valencia Fire Brigade AutonomousMunicipal Institute' The Committee requests the Government to have the labour inspectorate undertake an investigation into obstacles to free association in the bodies mentioned by the complainant and to inform it thereof.Harassment and vilification campaign against the Yaracuy FireBrigade Foundation and the promulgation of the law of  December which excludes firefighters from the rights of free association andcollective bargaining' The Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the law in question and to have the labour inspectorate undertake an investigation into the alleged harassment and vilification campaign.New allegations' As regards the allegations of SINPROBOM ( May ) and ASINBOMPROVEN (September ), the Committee notes that the Government confirms the allegations and attributes anti-union conduct to different local authorities, while the local authorities deny that they have an anti-union attitude and offer a different version of the facts. The Committee notes the Government s wish to continue with investigations and requests it to have the labour administrative authority (labour inspectorate) carry out an exhaustive investigation and inform it thereof. The Committee further requests that the investigation should also cover the allegations of ASINBOMPROVEN of  February  (according to this organization, the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade does not apply the rights contained in the collective agreement signed before the merger of the fire brigades in the case of  firefighters. Administrative proceedings were commenced against the president of the trade union for having invited the media to an interview in the trade union premises. In addition, for informing members of the date of an assembly, disciplinary action was taken against Martn Rodrguez, the trade union s secretary for international affairs and relations). The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure full respect for trade union rights in the fire-fighting sector.
.In its communication of  August , the National Trade Union Association of Professional Firefighters, Auxiliaries and Related Workers of Venezuela (ASINBOMPROVEN) refers to the allegations already made and states that the Chairperson of the National Executive Committee of ASINBOMPROVEN, Toms Arencibia, was dismissed following irregular disciplinary proceedings conducted by the Human Resources Director of the Metropolitan District of Caracas and the Commander-in-Chief of the Fire Brigade. The complainant adds that judicial proceedings were initiated regarding this dismissal and other violations of trade union rights, but these were declared unfounded.
.As regards the alleged discrimination against transferred workers who had previously worked at the Eastern Joint Fire Brigade (by revoking the labour rights obtained through collective bargaining), in its communication of  October , the Government states that as regards the acquired rights of the fire-fighting officers, the Caracas metropolitan mayor s office endeavoured to apply the collective agreement concluded between the former Eastern Joint Fire Brigade and its firefighters provided the provisions did not contravene legislation. This has not affected the position of transferred officers, given that, coincidentally, the benefits established in the aforementioned agreement are the same as those provided for in the arrangements enjoyed by Caracas Metropolitan District staff. Furthermore, the Government states that on no occasion did the Caracas metropolitan mayor s office prevent officers at the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade from establishing trade unions.
.Regarding the allegation that the authorities of the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade raided the office occupied by the trade union and illegally vacated the premises, without the presence of an official from the Attorney-General s Office, and wrongfully appropriated property belonging to the trade union, the Government states that according to information provided by the Commander-in-Chief of the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade, the ownership of the facilities that have been made available to the Fire Brigade, which are located in the Municipalities of Baruta, Chacao and Sucre, has not been transferred over to the Metropolitan District of Caracas and, in principle, the use of these facilities was made possible through documents handing them over on a right of use or loan for use basis. As regards the fire station at El Cafetal, where the premises occupied by the aforementioned trade union are located, to date, this station has not been officially handed over to the Metropolitan District of Caracas, given that it consists of two buildings, one of which is in the final stages of construction. The Government adds that neither Venezuelan legislation nor ILO decisions and resolutions have qualified the failure of employers to provide premises for trade unions as a violation of freedom of association.
.With reference to the launch of an administrative inquiry into the conduct of the president of the complainant organization, Second Sergeant (Sargento Segundo) Toms Arencibia, the Government states that on  October , the Commander-in-Chief of Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade requested the Human Resources Director of the metropolitan mayor s office of Caracas to open a disciplinary inquiry in accordance with the provisions of section , paragraph , of the Civil Service Statute Act, given that unsuccessful attempts had been made to: () try to reconcile the officer in question to his rights and duties within the organization; and () offer guidance on the regulations applicable to him and explain the action taken in view of his conduct by his direct superiors, who ordered him to perform his professional duties. Therefore, through the document dated  November , the Human Resources Director ordered the launch of a disciplinary inquiry into the conduct of the officer in question so as to verify the alleged misconduct involving dereliction of duty, failure to obey orders and instructions given by his direct supervisor, lack of respect and lack of probity towards his superiors. Through Memorandum No. D.C.J.  of  January , the Office of the Legal Counsel of the Caracas metropolitan mayor s office, came to a decision regarding this case and considered that  Mr. Toms Arencibia Ramrez disobeyed orders issued by his hierarchical superiors within the scope of their responsibilities, was guilty of insubordination on repeated occasions and failed to turn up for work'  and that  the disciplinary measures taken by the Human Resources Office were fair'  The Government considers that the dismissal of Mr. Toms Arencibia from his position as Second Sergeant of the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade does not constitute a violation of the right to freedom of association or its guarantees, such as trade union immunity, given that his dismissal resulted from the outcome of disciplinary proceedings, conducted with due process, which confirmed that the officer in question was guilty of serious misconduct when performing his duties.
.On the other hand, as regards the acts of aggression against members of the National Executive Committee, the Government states that according to the facts, events that were reported as an assault against Second Sergeant Toms Arencibia committed by some officials, following the direct orders issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the Fire Brigade, are incorrect, given that it has been established in this case that there was a physical confrontation between the official in question and Major Eleazar Corro, who acted in legitimate defence in response to the acts of aggression committed by Second Sergeant Toms Arencibia, who had provoked the physical confrontation. In any case, the",-1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
282,"Government states that there are no forensic reports to support the alleged serious injuries as reported by ASINBOMPROVEN suffered by Second Sergeant Toms Arencibia, and there is even less evidence that these injuries were the result of an order given by the Commander-in-Chief of the Fire Brigade.
.As regards the transfer of National Executive Committee members and the alleged suspension of trade union leave, granted through the collective agreement and regulations under the Administrative Service Act, the Government states that in the specific case of the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade, which serves approximately  million inhabitants, it would be irresponsible of high-ranking and commanding officers not to anticipate how many staff members they will have at any given time, which staff members have been granted leave, and for how long. It would be even more irresponsible of the firefighters and workers of this brigade to fail to turn up for work without notice or prior explanations. Unfortunately, ASINBOMPROVEN representatives misunderstood the nature of trade union leave by trying to take leave without following the necessary procedures beforehand and without any form of justification, using the excuse that they had the right to take leave to perform trade union activities. To date, the ASINBOMPROVEN representation has not obtained an administrative or judicial decision declaring the legitimacy of any leave required to fulfil trade union duties. On the contrary, with regard to Second Sergeant Toms Arencibia, the records on this case show that he received warnings for absence from the workplace and insubordinate conduct.
.The Government adds that as a result of integrating staff from the Eastern Joint Fire Brigade into the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade, it was necessary to make organizational changes. The Act on Fire Brigades and Civilian Crisis Management Entities, section , provides for the extension of activities by stating that:  fire brigades and civilian crisis management entities can extend their activities to any area within the region provided that their collaboration is requested by the commanding officer responsible for the area in question, and that the necessary coordination has been carried out between the competent authorities of the brigades involved'  Thus, according to the above, transfers are legitimate and within the authority of commanding officers, provided that such transfers are made to meet a request for collaboration made by the commanding officer responsible for the area in question. Therefore, the Government indicates that commanding officers can make transfers, if they so wish, and highlights that the transfer of officers that occurred at the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade did not affect in any way the rights and legitimate, personal and direct interests of the officer in question, given that this modification did not lead to any deterioration in working conditions.
.Lastly, with reference to the alleged anti-union conduct by the Mayor of Caracas and the Commander-in-Chief of the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade, the Government states that the authorities of the aforementioned Fire Brigade and the Mayor of Caracas expressed their opposition to the presence of a firefighters' trade union at this fire brigade in order to prevent certain groups and individuals from disrupting the establishment through their lack of discipline and failure to respect legislation and regulations. The position adopted by these authorities is not one of failing to recognize or rejecting collective bodies established to protect and demand the labour rights of workers and firefighters, rather one of maintaining the institutional system that must prevail within organizations, such as fire brigades responsible for the safety of citizens.
.The Committee notes this information and points out the contradiction between the version of events provided by the complainant and that given by the Government concerning the allegations. The Committee notes that the Government highlights that there were no acts of anti-union discrimination by the authorities of the Caracas metropolitan mayor s office and the fire brigade of this district. However, the Committee observes that when examining this case at its June  meeting, the Government confirmed some allegations of anti?union discrimination and attributed acts of anti-union conduct to various local authorities (it also stated that it would conduct investigations, the results of which have not been sent). In any case, the Committee recalls that firefighters (even if they are considered civil servants) must enjoy the guarantees provided for in Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Venezuela. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to this end and, more generally, to conduct negotiations with the complainants to find a solution to the problems posed in various localities and to keep it informed in this respect.
.At its meeting of March , the Committee formulated the following recommendations on the outstanding questions [see th Report, paras. -]:' The Committee deplores the fact that, according to the Government s indication, the officers and members of SINPROBOM have not yet obtained the lost wages corresponding to the period when they were dismissed (since ). The Committee notes with concern that the employer has appealed against the reinstatement of the trade union officers and the payment of their wages. The Committee insists that the Government ensure that these wages are paid and that the employment relationship of these officers and members affiliated to SINPROBOM [Glcido Gutirrez, Rubn Gutirrez, Toms Arancibia and Juan Bautista Medina] continues. It requests the Government to keep it informed of all court judgements in this respect.' The Committee notes the Government s statement concerning the draft decrees on the exercise of the function of firefighters' brigades and, more specifically, that it will ensure that the drafts are drawn up in a manner not to restrict freedom of association. The Committee would nevertheless point out with deep concern that the draft transmitted by the complainant provides for the dissolution of the firefighters' trade union and the creation of an association controlled by the employers' representatives. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls its previous recommendation requesting the Government to take the necessary measures to guarantee in law and in practice the right of firefighters to organize and to bargain collectively [see th Report, Case No. , para. ]. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed of the evolution of the situation.' The Committee further requests the Government to reply in detail to the following allegations:n the anti-union campaign to hinder the right of the firefighters of the Eastern Fire Brigade, the Fire Brigade of Guacara, San Joaqun and Mariara, and the Municipal Autonomous Fire Brigade Institute of Valencia to join the workers' organization of their own free choice;n the dismissal of a member of the executive committee of the union of the Fire Brigade of Valencia (Emerson Ochoa) and the regular transfer of trade union leaders for anti-union motives; andn the campaign of harassment and vilification in respect of the Fire Brigade of Yaracuy and the promulgation of the Act of December  which excludes firefighters from the right to organize and to bargain collectively.
.In a communication of  May , the Trade Union Association of Professional Firefighters, Auxiliaries and Others of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SINPROBOM) and in a communication of September , the National Trade Union Association of Professional Firefighters, Auxiliaries and Related Workers of Venezuela (ASINBOMPROVEN), a new organization resulting from the merger of various organizations including SINPROBOM, provide new information of which the following should be highlighted:' signatures were collected by the employer s legal representatives with the object of forcing officers belonging to the Caracas Fire Brigade to reject the trade union organization. The signatures were formally handed to the metropolitan mayor of Caracas by the Commander-in-Chief of the Fire Brigade;'  black lists' are being drawn up to identify trade union leaders and prevent them from freely acting as trade union representatives, as well as to harass them and prevent them from entering the various places of work;' trade union leave, granted through collective bargaining, as well as by the current regulations under the Administrative Service Act is being suspended, thus allowing members of the trade union s national executive committee to be transferred; as a result, this situation hinders the free exercise of trade union activities;' there are requests to vacate trade union premises, and prohibitions on holding meetings of any kind with members, with the object of preventing the distribution of information on the implementation of trade union strategies and plans;' after being notified of the registration of the new trade union organization (ASINBOMPROVEN), the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade ordered the transfer of the trade union official, Luis Rodrguez Herrera, the union s culture and training secretary. Subsequently, the authorities forced this official to take compulsory retirement;' there is a breach of collective agreements and the acquired rights of all firefighters and, especially, reduction in wages of the administrative personnel of the former Eastern Fire Brigade;' in addition, the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade refuses to allow firefighters to exercise the rights to submit collective petitions and propose voluntary collective bargaining of conditions of work, the employer threatening to impose disciplinary sanctions",-1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
283,"and dismissals in cases where collective disputes arise.
.In its communication of  February , ASINBOMPROVEN sends new information which was transmitted to the Government for its observations. According to this organization, the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade does not apply the rights contained in the collective agreement signed before the merger of the capital s fire brigades in the case of  firefighters. Administrative proceedings were commenced against the president of the trade union for having invited the media to an interview in the trade union premises. In addition, for informing members of the date of an assembly, disciplinary action was taken against Martn Rodrguez, the trade union s secretary for international affairs and relations.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that the fire brigades have been decentralized and that the Constitution of the Republic recognizes their civilian character. The Ministry of Labour has achieved a series of steps forward in the face of attempts by the employers (some governors and mayors) to challenge the registration or inscription of trade unions in this sector (such as the new organization ASINBOMPROVEN which merges several unions) and has recognized the corresponding trade union rights (including collective bargaining) seeking by all means to remedy anti-union conduct and acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The most striking cases of anti-union discrimination have been those suffered by the officials and members of the Trade Union Association of Professional Firefighters, Auxiliaries and Others of the Federal District and the State of Miranda, as well as the Firefighters Trade Union of the Municipalities of Guacara, San Joaqun and Mariana in the State of Carabobo. Indeed, the obduracy and deliberate refusal by the employers to voluntarily comply with the reinstatement orders issued by the labour administration, assisted by the suborning, connivance and complicity of the labour courts, forced the National Legislative Commission, mandated by the National Constituent Assembly, to pass a resolution of  June  which emphatically ratified the obligation to reinstate and compensate the workers affected by the anti-union discrimination. The Government sends a copy of this Commission s resolution.
.As regards the judicial guarantees of compliance with these obligations, as pointed out, the story is contradictory and at times disappointing given the subordination and the situation described above which, some noteworthy exceptions apart, have occurred in the past and persist now. In this respect, there is a situation of impunity which makes it impossible to reinstate quickly the officials and members of SINPROBOM and SINTRABOM. However, the reinstatement order in respect of Emerson Ochoa, under the procedure of constitutional amparo or legal protection was recently obeyed. According to documentation from local authorities, Toms Arancibia has been reinstated and received his wage arrears.
.The Government adds that the national executive, through the Ministry of Labour, recognizes the firefighters' right freely and voluntarily to negotiate their conditions of work with their respective employers. Certainly this right has been limited by the exercise of command by the authorities within institutions which state that such a right is not possible given the application of a  paramilitary' or  uasi military' discipline. Nevertheless, in , SINPROBOM discussed with its employer, the Eastern Joint Fire Brigade, the first collective agreement for this category of workers in the country. This contractual instrument was formally deposited with the respective Inspectorate of Labour and was subsequently revised and amended, although not without disputes, the last of which involved a hunger strike in front of the town hall in the autonomous municipality of Chacao in the State of Miranda, aimed at forcing compliance with the universal principle of equal pay for equal work. Likewise, after years of trade union persecution, the trade union officials of the Fire Brigade Foundation of the municipalities of Guaraca, San Joaqun and Mariara in the State of Carabobo are engaged in a process of voluntary collective bargaining with the employer concerned.
.The most significant express and positive recognition of the right of voluntary collective bargaining for this sector can be found in article  of the Decree of  May  creating the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade. It is expressly laid down there that it must imperatively be respected and obeyed and its provisions remain in force.
.In the authoritarian and militaristic view of those who rule the Caracas metropolitan mayor s office, and a group of officers and commanders of the capital s fire brigade, the creation of the new body was a good opportunity to eliminate the country s principal firefighters' trade union. It should not be forgotten that those who make up and preside over the National College of Firefighters are, at the same time, the employers' representatives at national level. It is thus a case of an association presided over by the Commanders of the Caracas Fire Brigades who at the same time claim to discuss their economic and professional interests. In the face of this a priori anti-union position, the future of the Eastern Joint Fire Brigade (which no longer exists) was the perfect alibi for the elimination of SINPROBOM. To such an extent that, despite the efforts of the metropolitan mayor to prevent the transfer and merger of the fire services, thereby avoiding recognition of the trade union, the metropolitan council, the legislative organ of the city of Caracas, adopted the Decree creating the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade. The opposition of the metropolitan mayor of Caracas was so manifest that he even refused to sign the new Decree as required by the Municipal Government Organic Act and it had to be published under the signature of the vice-president of the metropolitan council.
.This explains a series of acts by the representatives of the city council and the representatives of the new Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade, regarding which the national executive continues to be watchful to prevent further human rights violation such as: (a) discrimination in prompt and correct payment of wages and other remuneration to trade union officials and activists; (b) unilateral compulsory retirement of trade union officials; (c) raids on trade union offices; (d) failure to respect trade union permits and leave; (e) the deliberate public campaign by commanders of the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade to collect enforced signatures rejecting the trade union, supporting public statements by the Caracas metropolitan mayor; and (f) the physical assaults and aggression against trade union officials. Conduct which violates and fundamentally threatens human rights and the international obligations assumed by the Republic has thus worsened. This situation, clearly, will ensure that the metropolitan mayor and authorities of the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade act in a way which respects their firefighters' human rights, including freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.In the allegations in the present case, the Government goes on to say, various acts and different individual situations have been mentioned involving state and municipal authorities. The majority of these authorities form part of the ultra-right opposition block which facilitated and contributed to the coup d at last  April , in particular, the metropolitan mayor, the governor of the State of Yaracuy, the mayors of the autonomous municipalities of Chacao and Baruta in the State of Miranda and the governor of the State of Miranda. These people, with their authoritarian and fascist baggage, are behind the persecution suffered for years and still suffered by officials and activists of SINPROBOM, now ASINBOMPROVEN. They are the ones who refused to discuss conditions of work voluntarily, who refuse registration of trade unions, who do not accept the consequences of the Decree creating the Caracas Metropolitan District Fire Brigade, who refuse leave and permissions for trade union activities and who are promoting a campaign of repression and vilification within the fire brigades, thus engaging in various forms of discrimination.
.The position of the national executive has been to call on these authorities to reflect on their actions, fall into line with the framework of the law and the Constitution, and acknowledge that the enjoyment of freedom of association does not conspire against the exercise of government, since unionized firefighters have demonstrated an excellent level of public service as well as formulating proposals to the Government on cost savings and optimizing service to the public.
.The national executive, through the Ministry of Labour, will continue to conduct investigations to verify compliance with the obligations contained in Conventions Nos.  and  of the International Labour Organization.
.Finally, the Government sends the replies of the mayors and institutions mentioned in the complaints, which are summarized as follows:' The wage arrears of officers belonging to the Eastern Joint Fire Brigade and transferred in  to the metropolitan district were paid and the delay was due to causes beyond the town hall s control. These workers include the trade union official Toms Arancibia. The wages of Glcido Gutirrez were also paid.' The collection of signatures in the Metropolitan District Fire Brigade did not come from the brigade s commander but was an initiative by a group of senior officers and other ranks, in particular concerning the promotion of a supposed trade union unknown to them, who had",-1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
284,"not participated in its formation and in the absence of an electoral process. The trade union did not represent the brigade s collective interests, although it had the support of groups of staff of other brigades in the country.' No blacklists were drawn up. Thirteen officers refused to work in the assigned places and were absent from duty claiming trade union business when they did not have any kind of trade union leave.' The supposed complainant union did not request any leave from the employer nor can it enforce a collective agreement with a former fire brigade (which no longer exists).' As to the alleged requests to vacate trade union premises or banning of meetings, the premises were occupied by members of the presumed trade union without authorization. A period of notice was given to move out but they were not evicted.' As regards the transfer of the trade union official, Luis Rodrguez Herrera and his subsequent compulsory retirement, the trade union s registration was not known and the transfer (without demotion) of the workplace is quite normal due to the needs of the service. Retirement is not a punishment but a benefit which may not be waived.' As to the violation of collective bargaining, the trade union which was party to the collective agreement (which did not apply to the metropolitan district) no longer exists. No petition was presented in the metropolitan district. No disciplinary sanctions were imposed and there were no threats.' In November , the wages of the Eastern Joint Fire Brigade were aligned with those of the metropolitan firefighters, including administrative personnel. For this reason, the metropolitan mayor simply considered it unnecessary to mention parity in the Decree to which the complainant refers (moreover the mayor s proposal was not accepted by the metropolitan council). The benefits enjoyed by the employees of the Joint Brigade (including those achieved through collective bargaining) are in essence the same as those enjoyed by officers of the Metropolitan District Fire Brigade. Thus, their hierarchy, seniority and acquired rights were respected.Dismissals of unionized firefighters
.The Committee observes that, according to the Government, the labour administration ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed officers but the attitude of the employers with the suborning, connivance and complicity of the labour courts (from which they sought reinstatement) resulted in the National Legislative Commission passing the resolution of  June  ratifying the obligation to reinstate and compensate the workers concerned.
.The Committee notes that the Government reports that Emerson Ochoa has been reinstated as the result of a judicial measure of  amparo' and that according to the local authorities, Toms Arancibia has been reinstated and has received his wage arrears. Trade union official Glcido Gutirrez has also received his wages. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the decision of the judicial authority on the question of the reinstatement of trade unionists Rubn Gutirrez and Juan Bautista Medina and payment of unpaid wages.Draft decree restricting firefighters' trade union rights
.The Committee understands that by the Decree of  May  the abovementioned draft decrees mentioned by the complainants were dropped and observes that, as the Government states, article  of that Decree recognizes the right of collective bargaining (this Decree was agreed with the trade unions, according to the local authorities) and that collective bargaining is in progress in the municipalities of Guacara, San Joaqun and Mariana. The Committee notes that the Government states that the Constitution of the Republic recognizes the civilian character of the fire brigades and that the Government recognizes the trade union rights of such workers and points out that a new organization, ASINBOMPROVEN, has been formed which merges several existing trade unions. The Committee finds that the abovementioned Decree does not provide for the dissolution of trade unions or the constitution of an association controlled by the employers unlike, according to the complainant, the previous draft decrees which were dropped. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee the exercise of trade union rights in the fire-fighting sector.Anti-union campaign to prevent the right of free association of firefighters in the Eastern Joint Fire Brigade, the Guacara, San Joaqun and Mariara Fire Brigade Foundation, and the Valencia Fire Brigade Autonomous Municipal Institute
.The Committee requests the Government to have the labour inspectorate undertake an investigation into obstacles to free association in the bodies mentioned by the complainant and to inform it thereof.Harassment and vilification campaign against the YaracuyFire Brigade Foundation and the promulgation of the law of  December  which excludes firefighters from the rights of free association and collective bargaining
.The Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the law in question and to have the labour inspectorate undertake an investigation into the alleged harassment and vilification campaign.New allegations
.As regards the allegations of SINPROBOM ( May ) and ASINBOMPROVEN (September ), the Committee notes that the Government confirms the allegations and attributes anti-union conduct to different local authorities, while the local authorities deny that they have an anti-union attitude and offer a different version of the facts. The Committee notes the Government s wish to continue with investigations and requests it to have the labour administrative authority (labour inspectorate) carry out an exhaustive investigation and inform it thereof. The Committee further requests that the investigation should also cover the allegations of ASINBOMPROVEN of  February . The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure full respect for trade union rights in the fire-fighting sector.
.In its last examination of this case in November , the Committee noted that the Government had not sent any information relating to the matter of the effective payment of the wage arrears of the firefighters (officers and members of SINPROBOM of the Eastern Fire Brigade) corresponding to the period during which they were dismissed and requested the Government to provide information in this respect [see rd Report, para. ]. These persons had been reinstated in their jobs.
.In its communications dated  and  August and  September , SINPROBOM alleges that the Government attempted to adopt a decree with the scope and force of law on the exercise of the function of firefighters' brigades (a copy of the draft was transmitted with their communications). This decree aims at eliminating trade union rights by linking this brigade with the defence and security of the nation and provides for the dissolution of firefighters' trade unions within  days. Moreover, the complainant alleges that an anti-union campaign has begun with a view towards restricting the rights of the firefighters of the Eastern Fire Brigade, the Fire Brigade of Guacara, San Joaqun and Mariara, and the Municipal Autonomous Fire Brigade Institute of Valencia to join the workers' organization of their own choosing. The complainant further alleges the dismissal of a member of the executive committee of the Fire Brigade Union of Valencia (Emerson Ochoa) brigade in which the employer opposes collective bargaining and in which regular transfers of union officers occur with anti-union motives. The complainant also alleges that the state of Yaracuy maintains a campaign of hostility and disparagement in respect of the Fire Brigade Foundation of this state and, by means of a new law of  December , has excluded firefighters from the right to organize and to bargain collectively.
.In its communication of  October , in reply to the Committee s request for information, the Government refers to steps taken for the rehiring of Tomas Arencebia, Juan Bautista Medina, Rubn Gutirrez, Ignacio Daz and Plcido Gutirrez, unjustifiably dismissed from the Eastern Fire Brigade, while they were protected by trade union immunity and should have been untransferrable. The Government also refers to the employer s request to annul the administrative order for reinstatement and payment of loss of wages, as well as the summons given on  and  August  by the local prefecture, under warning of imprisonment. On these specifics, the Government indicates that the new Venezuelan Constitution provides a new basic labour standard process, with the aim of confirming the reinstatement orders. The Government adds that the Supreme Court rendered a judgement on  August  according to which the administrative courts will be responsible for reviewing the abovementioned causes as well as the recourse for judicial protection (amparo) in the case of non-compliance with the reinstatement order, all with the aim of ensuring that the administrative decision for reinstatement does not become illusory. The Government indicates that it will give the necessary follow-up to these matters and keep the Committee informed.
.As concerns the collective rights of the fire-fighting personnel of the Eastern Fire Brigade, the Government indicates that, on  and  August , SINPROBOM denounced some government conduct which it considered to be in the context of measures of anti-union discrimination (they refer to the mayors' offices which cover the communities of Eastern Caracas: Chacao, Baruta and Sucre), as well as artificial situations in respect of the supposed deficit which hinders a concession on the benefits requested in the draft collective agreement and attacks",1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
285,"from the mayors' offices aimed at weakening trade union association. The Government underlines, on the other hand, that the complainant recognizes the good offices of the Minister of Labour and the Public Defender, while the eastern labour inspectorate recognized trade union rights, protection against anti-union discrimination and collective bargaining.
.The Government considers the complainant s request to the Committee to condemn the State for violation of Convention No.  out of context and disproportionate, given that the State itself, through the Minister of Labour, is trying to ensure that the collective rights violated in this case may be fully exercised.
.Finally, as concerns the draft decrees with force of law, the Government states that, by means of a highly responsible examination of the concrete national reality, a series of measures and drafts have been put in place aimed at raising the concept of citizen security, the living standard of the population and the protection of the national interest, without forgetting collective labour rights and even envisaging their improvement. In this respect, the Government will ensure that these texts are drafted with special attention to these rights. It reiterates its firm intention to count on the Committee s collaboration and assistance in the aspects concerning freedom of association and their appropriate application.
.The Committee deplores the fact that, according to the Government s indication, the officers and members of SINPROBOM have not yet obtained the lost wages corresponding to the period when they were dismissed (since ). The Committee notes with concern that the employer has appealed against the reinstatement of the trade union officers and the payment of their wages. The Committee insists that the Government ensure that these wages are paid and that the employment relationship of these officers and members affiliated to SINPROBOM continues. It requests the Government to keep it informed of all court judgements in this respect.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement concerning the draft decrees on the exercise of the function of firefighters' brigades and, more specifically, that it will ensure that the drafts are drawn up in a manner not to restrict freedom of association. The Committee would nevertheless point out with deep concern that the draft transmitted by the complainant provides for the dissolution of the firefighters' trade union and the creation of an association controlled by the employers' representatives. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls its previous recommendation requesting the Government to take the necessary measures to guarantee in law and in practice the right of firefighters to organize and to bargain collectively [see th Report, Case No. , para. ]. The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed of the evolution of the situation.
.The Committee further requests the Government to reply in detail to the following allegations:(a) the anti-union campaign to hinder the right of the firefighters of the Eastern Fire Brigade, the Fire Brigade of Guacara, San Joaqun and Mariara, and the Municipal Autonomous Fire Brigade Institute of Valencia to join the workers' organization of their own free choice;(b) the dismissal of a member of the executive committee of the union of the Fire Brigade of Valencia (Emerson Ochoa) and the regular transfer of trade union leaders for anti-union motives; and(c) the campaign of harassment and disparagement in respect of the Fire Brigade of Yaracuy and the promulgation of the Act of December  which excludes firefighters from the right to organize and to bargain collectively.
.In its previous examination of the case in November , the Committee requested the Government to inform it about the discussions that were taking place on the payment of wage arrears to trade union officials and members of SINPROBOM who had been dismissed (and subsequently reinstated) as a result of collective action [see th Report, para. ].
.In communications dated  and  October and  December , SINPROBOM states that the recognition of the promotions due to the firemen who are trade union officials and members of the abovementioned organization has yet to be resolved as only six promotions have taken place. SINPROBOM understands that the resources are being arranged to repay the wage arrears of its trade union officials but it requests the Committee to remain vigilant and call for information from the Government.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government sent a copy of general orders Nos. - and - signed by the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Fire Brigade, concerning the promotions of the firemen belonging to SINPROBOM, including the members of the executive committee of SINPROBOM. The total number of promotions is .
.The Committee notes the Government's information that  firemen have been promoted. Nevertheless, the Committee observes that the Government has not sent information relating to the matter of the effective payment of the wage arrears of the firemen corresponding to the period during which they were dismissed and asks it to provide some information in this respect.
.At its last examination of the case in March  (see th Report, paras. -), the Committee: () again requested the Government to ensure the reinstatement in their posts of the union officials and members who had been dismissed or transferred (Glcido Gutirrez, Rubn Gutirrez, Toms Arencibia, Juan Bautista and Ignacio Daz, and a considerable number of union members), and to keep it informed of any decision or ruling that might be handed down; and () as regards the allegations concerning the summoning of Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez to appear before a prefecture and the request for a police presence by the Eastern Fire Brigade Association when the union officials in question were at the Association's headquarters, the Committee requested the Government to carry out an investigation into these allegations and, if acts of intimidation or anti-union discrimination were found to have taken place, to take the necessary measures to prevent any recurrence and punish those responsible.
.In a communication dated  October , the Government states that on  October  a meeting took place at the headquarters of the Ministry of Internal Relations involving representatives of: the municipal authorities of Baruta, Chacao and Sucre; the Eastern Fire Brigade Association; the Governor of the State of Miranda; the trade union SINPROBOM; and the National Constituent Assembly, with a view to reaching an agreement to stop the hunger strike; an agreement was duly signed providing for the allocation of funds to pay the claims of SINPROBOM members and officials who had been reinstated, including back arrears of wages. The Government indicates that Mr. Toms Arencibia and Mr. Glcido Gutirrez enjoy complete physical freedom within the premises of the Eastern Fire Brigade Association, where there is no police presence, and have the use of their own area for union activities, as was evident from the meeting previously referred to at the fire brigade premises between SINPROBOM and Ministry of Labourrepresentatives.
.The Committee takes note of this information, from which it infers that the trade union officials and members of the complainant organization who were dismissed in  have been reinstated in their posts and that discussions are taking place on payment of wage arrears. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. Lastly, given that the Government has not replied to the allegation concerning the summoning of the trade union officials Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez to appear before a prefecture, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to prevent acts which could be interpreted as intimidation of trade union officials.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in May-June  and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session in June ).
.Subsequently, the Trade Union of Professional Fire-Fighters and Allied Workers of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SINPROBOM) sent new allegations in a communication of  October . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the previous examination of the case, the following allegations presented by the complainant remained pending: () the dismissal of several trade union officials of their organization (in the fire-fighting sector), namely Glcido Gutirrez, Rubn Gutirrez, Toms Arencibia and Juan Bautista Medina, and of a significant number of union members, as well as the transfer of another union official (Ignacio Daz); and () the summoning of Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez to appear before two prefectures under penalty of imprisonment.
.The Committee, having examined the Government's observations, made the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):(a) The Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee the maintenance in law and in practice of the right to organize and to bargain collectively of fire-fighters.(b) The Committee requests the Government to guarantee the legal status of the complainant organization as a trade union organization.(c) The Committee requests the Government to guarantee the reinstatement in their posts of the trade union officials belonging to",1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
286,"the complainant organization who were dismissed or transferred, at least until the judicial authority has handed down its decision in this matter.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the alleged arbitrary dismissal of various members of the complainant organization.(e) The Committee requests the Government to respond to the allegation that, on  and  August , the trade union executives Messrs. Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez were summoned to appear before the Prefecture of the Paz Castillo Municipality of the State of Miranda and the Prefecture of the Libertador Municipality of the Federal District under penalty of imprisonment.
.In its communication of  October , the Trade Union of Professional Fire-Fighters and Allied Workers of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SINPROBOM) states that the acts of anti-union discrimination against trade union officials which had been alleged (and which dated back to July ) have not been remedied, since as a result of inactivity and procedural delays the Ninth Labour Court of First Instance of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas has given no definitive ruling in the matter (confining itself instead to provisionally suspending the order of the administrative authorities to reinstate the union officials in their posts), although the Supreme Court recently stated in a similar case that the ordinary labour regulations, and therefore also trade union freedoms and guarantees in accordance with the Organic Labour Law, apply to the workers of the Eastern Fire Brigade Association, and despite the fact that the Permanent Commission on Social Affairs of the Chamber of Deputies issued a report in July  in which it correctly interpreted the scope and significance of the decision of the Committee on Freedom of Association in the present case.
.As regards the dismissals of SINPROBOM members, the proceedings initiated before the Ministry of Labour (reinstatement and payment of salaries) have not been finally settled by the labour inspector, although they have been in progress for more than  months; according to legislation, a decision should have been given within  working days, and what now exists is a situation of denial of justice.
.At the same time, the complainant alleges that on  October , the Chief of Operations of the Eastern Fire Brigade Association called in police when union officials Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez were present, in order to prevent them from doing their work.
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that it bears no responsibility for the alleged violations, since they involve the actions of other branches of state authority (the judiciary and the municipal and regional executive authorities) which are autonomous and, under Venezuelan law, not liable to interference from the Government. Nevertheless, the Government confirms that to date, it, through the Ministry of Labour, has recognized the legal status of the trade union SINPROBOM and the trade union rights claimed by it, through the administrative proceedings recognized by the complainant. It is striking that SINPROBOM has persisted in pursuing its claims and sought -- successfully -- to win recognition of those claims at the administrative level, knowing the constraints imposed by legislation on the actions of the administration. On the other hand, although a number of effective and legally recognized means are available for bringing an action before the courts (for example, action to obtain constitutional protection), the organization in question has confined itself to presenting a complaint of violations of trade union rights to the ILO.
.With regard to the suspension of the effect of the administrative precautionary measure adopted by the labour inspector, who ordered the reinstatement of the union officials, the Government states that the labour court judge in the case acted on a request from representatives of the Eastern Fire Brigade Association who believed that their rights had been infringed by the labour inspector's decision. Judicial review of the labour inspector's decision is recognized by law, inasmuch as that decision is an administrative act and as such can be overruled by decision of a court. This provides a safeguard against arbitrary or unlawful action by the administrative authority. This safeguard provided by the law cannot automatically give way to provisions which exist to protect freedom of association; both deserve appropriate protection.
.The Government adds that the suspension of the effects of the labour inspector's administrative decision is a precautionary measure requested by one of the parties and adopted by the judge to avert the risks related to a final ruling finding that the administrative decision was without foundation. It is assumed that in the present case, the judge, acting in an autonomous capacity (in which the national executive may not interfere without encroaching on the competence of a different branch of the public authority), was obliged to assess the legality of the preventive measure before agreeing to it and accordingly suspended the effect of the administrative decision. All this is recognized by law, and, whatever the Government's opinion in the matter, such a judicial ruling must be respected and cannot be contravened on the pretext of ensuring the reinstatement of SINPROBOM executives as ordered by an administrative department of the executive branch. The case will be finally settled by the courts.
.On the other hand, the Government indicates that, in the face of the alleged arbitrary dismissals of some workers belonging to the union, the workers concerned can make use of various administrative or legal remedies in order to re-establish the legal situation which had been infringed, if they are responding to anti-union discrimination. The Ministry of Labour will be attentive to any petition that might be received and will take action within the limits of its procedures and competence. As regards the alleged delays caused by a number of labour officials with regard to the dismissals of union members, the necessary instructions have been given to clarify the facts and, where necessary, to take appropriate corrective measures.
.As regards the allegations concerning the summoning of Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez under penalty of imprisonment, the Government states that, in the absence of any detailed information from the complainant concerning the circumstances, it can only say that the law provides sufficient safeguards to ensure that no citizen can be arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty. The Government will be attentive to this situation, although no such violation -- deprivation of liberty of the officials referred to -- has occurred.
.The Committee notes that the pending allegations refer to: () the dismissal of various trade union officials from their organization (in the fire-fighting sector), namely Glcido Gutirrez, Rubn Gutirrez, Toms Arencibia and Juan Bautista Medina, and of a significant number of union members, as well as the transfer of another union official (Ignacio Daz); () the summoning of Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez to appear before the two prefectures under penalty of imprisonment; and () the request for the presence of police by officials of the Eastern Fire Brigade Association at a time when SINPROBOM officials were present at the Association's headquarters. The Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that it has recognized the unions's legal status and the trade union rights to which it lays claim.
.As regards the dismissals and acts of discrimination against officials of the union SINPROBOM, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that the judicial authority is autonomous and the Government therefore cannot interfere in its activities, that the judicial authority in question temporarily suspended the order issued by the administrative authority to reinstate the trade union officials, and that the case will be resolved by the judicial authority. As regards the dismissals of SINPROBOM members, the Committee notes that the Government states that the workers concerned can make use of a number of administrative and legal remedies and that the delays which some labour officials are alleged to have caused have given rise to instructions to clarify the facts and, if necessary, to take corrective measures.
.As regards the Government's statement that the judiciary branch is autonomous and its decisions cannot be interfered with by the executive branch without encroaching upon the mandate of another public authority, the Committee considers that it is certainly important that a judicial authority be able to judge cases concerning dismissals and the question of their illegality. It considers however that it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure the application of international labour Conventions concerning freedom of association which have been freely ratified and which must be respected by all state authorities, including the judicial authorities.
.In the light of this information, and taking into account the fact that the measures taken against trade unionists are based on an interpretation of the law that excludes fire-fighters from the right to organize and collective bargaining (see th Report, paras.  and ), the Committee can only repeat its previous conclusions to the effect that the trade union officials who were dismissed or transferred in July  should be reinstated in their former posts (see th Report, para. ), and regret that the judicial authority has still not given a ruling on the",-1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
287,"matter and has provisionally suspended the administrative decision to reinstate the officials in question. The Committee also regrets that the Ministry of Labour has still not given a decision on the alleged anti-union dismissal of members of SINPROBOM, although these date back to . Under these circumstances, the Committee once again requests the Government, as it did during its previous examination of the case, to take the necessary measures and initiatives to ensure the reinstatement of the union officials of the complainant organization who were dismissed or transferred, and that of the union members who were dismissed, and to keep it informed of any decision or ruling that may be handed down in the matter. The Committee recalls that ""cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.  should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really effective. An excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination, and in particular a lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by the enterprise, constitute a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th (revised) edition, , para. ).
.Lastly, as regards the allegations concerning the summoning of Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez to appear before a prefecture and the request for a police presence by the Eastern Fire Brigade Association at a time when the union officials in question were present at the Association's headquarters, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that the complainant has not described the precise circumstances in which the two union officials were summoned and that they were not in any case deprived of their liberty. The Committee also notes that the Government has not referred to the presence of police requested by the Eastern Fire Brigade Association when the two officials in question were present at the Association's headquarters. In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into these allegations and, if acts of intimidation or anti-union measures are found to have taken place, to take the necessary measures to prevent any recurrence of such practices and punish those responsible.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure the reinstatement in their posts of the union officials and members of the complainant organization who were dismissed or transferred, and to keep it informed of any decision or ruling that may be handed down in the matter. Taking into account the fact that such measures date back to , the Committee recalls the principle according to which ""cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.  should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really effective. An excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination, and in particular a lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by the enterprise, constitute a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned"".(b) As regards the allegations concerning the summoning of Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez to appear before a prefecture and the request for a police presence by the Eastern Fire Brigade Association when the union officials in question were at the Association's headquarters, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into these allegations and, if acts of intimidation or anti-union measures are found to have taken place, to take the necessary measures to prevent any recurrence of such practices and punish those responsible.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Professional Fire-Fighters and Allied Workers of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SINPROBOM) dated  February . The complainant submitted new allegations in a communication dated  April .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Trade Union of Professional Fire-Fighters and Allied Workers of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SINPROBOM) alleges in its communications dated  February and  April  that on  July  the Eastern Fire Brigade Association arbitrarily dismissed Messrs. Glcido Gutirrez, Rubn Gutirrez, Toms Arencibia and Juan Bautista Medina (four of the seven members of its executive board) and that a further member of the executive board (Mr. Ignacio Daz) was subsequently transferred, resulting in a reduction of remuneration and a decline in working conditions. In addition, a considerable number of workers (all members of the complainant organization) were also dismissed arbitrarily and unjustly. The complainant explains that on  February  it had submitted a list of demands which were still under negotiation, meaning that the trade unionists were invested with immunity from dismissal and therefore any measure to be taken against them required prior notification to the labour inspector who had to give a reasoned opinion on the matter, under penalty of the invalidation of the prejudicial measures.
.The complainant adds that in the appeals it submitted the employers' representatives stated that the workers in question were public officials who were excluded from the protection of the Organic Labour Law and that in addition there was the ""paramilitary"" nature of the service provided by the fire-fighters which was qualified as a ""security"" service, meaning that the individuals in question were excluded from trade union rights. Almost eight months after the dismissals and transfers, on  March , the Ministry of Labour ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed and transferred trade unionists and, bearing in mind a previous decision of the Committee on Freedom of Association, recognized that the fire-fighters have the right to establish and join organizations and to conclude collective agreements, and that they are not public service employees, and therefore come under the Organic Labour Law. However, in the actual reinstatement order issued by the Ministry of Labour it is stated that fire-fighters provide services for the armed forces, which paradoxically would exclude them from the Organic Labour Law, as provided in section  of the Law.
.In spite of the Ministry of Labour's decision, the Eastern Fire Brigade Association maintained the dismissals and transfers of the officials of the complainant trade union. Representatives of the Association submitted an application to annul the order for reinstatement issued by the Ministry of Labour to the Ninth Labour and Labour Stability Court of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas and, in addition, requested the cancellation of the registration of SINPROBOM, issued by the Ministry of Labour on  April . This request was based on the following:-- the trade union officials of SINPROBOM are public service employees and, therefore, the labour inspectorate, as part of the Ministry of Labour, cannot make an application for protection against the acts of anti-union discrimination to which they were subjected, and-- the fire-fighters provide services to ""State security forces"" which are of a ""paramilitary"" nature and they are part of the ""armed forces"", not being eligible for the protection of freedom of association, collective bargaining and protection against anti-union acts provided in the Organic Labour Law.
.The complainant indicates that unexpectedly and suddenly, on  April , which was the working day following the receipt of the application for nullity from the Eastern Fire Brigade Association, the court ordered the provisional suspension of the implementation of the decision taken by the Ministry of Labour until such a time as a decision was handed down on the merits of the case, which could take as long as a year or more given the procedural delays in Venezuela's judicial system. In other words, the trade union officials who had been dismissed, transferred and demoted will go on suffering from anti-union discrimination until a final decision has been handed down in the case in question, rendering the Ministry of Labour's decision entirely ineffective. In practice this means allowing the elimination of SINPROBOM, since the dismissal of the trade union officials is only one of a number of means that have been used to eliminate this trade union organization.
.Furthermore, the complainant recalls that on  and  August , the trade union executives Messrs. Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez were summoned to appear before the Prefecture of the Paz Castillo Municipality of the State of Miranda and the Prefecture of the Libertador Municipality of the Federal District, under penalty of imprisonment. These bodies control the regional police forces and their involvement in the dispute was aimed at frightening the trade union officials into not pursuing their efforts to defend workers.
.According to the complainant, these events are part of a plan by the regional and local authorities to eliminate the organization. In this connection, in the minutes of the meeting dated  February  of the Municipal Council of Chacao in the State of",1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
288,"Miranda, the Governor of the State indicates that: ""the Fire-fighters' Act approved by the Congress of the Republic does not permit the existence of a trade union. We are waiting for a legal opinion in this respect, as this is a State security body ..."". This statement has the support of the Governor himself, as well as the department board members and town councillors attending the session. Likewise, in the document submitted by the members of the management board of the Eastern Fire Brigade Association dated June  (one month before the dismissals of the trade union officials) it is stated that SINPROBOM ""has no place vis--vis the Fire Brigade, given that this is an institution for the security and defence of the State"". Likewise, it recommends ""that the trade union that operates within the body be eliminated"".
.In its communication dated  April , the Government states that by way of the administrative decision handed down by the labour inspectorate for the eastern district of the metropolitan area of Caracas, the requests for reinstatement and the payment of unpaid wages, filed on  and  July  by Messrs. Glcido Gutirrez, Juan Bautista Medina, Toms Arencibia, Ruben Gutirrez and Ignacio Daz, against the Eastern Fire Brigade Association were admitted, and therefore the institution was ordered to immediately proceed to reinstate these individuals in the duties they occupied before their dismissal and in the same conditions in which they worked previously, as well as to immediately pay them the wages that had been stopped, calculated from the date of the dismissals and the demotion, that is from  July , up to the date of their definitive reinstatement in their posts. This decision is in accordance with sections , ,  and  of the Organic Labour Law currently in force and there is no possibility of an administrative appeal, as stated in section ; however, an application for nullity can be brought against it before the competent courts within a time-limit of six months from the date of notification. The Government attaches a copy of the administrative decision.
.The administrative decision provides as follows (extracts):... in respect of the Eastern Fire Brigade there are no special regulations relating to collective labour relations or in particular to measures for the protection of freedom of association. This being the case: (a) since the exercise of trade union activities is not in any way incompatible with the services provided by fire-fighters and, in fact, as the Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Labour Organization stated recently, ""all necessary measures"" must be taken ""to guarantee the maintenance in law and in practice of the right to organize and to bargain collectively, it being understood that the right to strike can be prohibited for these workers ...""; (b) bearing in mind that there is no express regulation that governs this matter for such workers; and (c) given that in this specific case there is no other form of special protection such as so-called trade union immunity, which this administrative labour office should apply in accordance with the Organic Labour Law (Title VII, Chapter II, section ); it is therefore declared that the workers of the Eastern Fire Brigade shall benefit from the protection of trade union immunity, in the terms provided in the Organic Labour Law. (...)These official communications confirm the fact that the persons bringing this action had stopped ""providing their services for the permanent operation of this institution"", and that even the members of the executive board of the savings bank which operates within this association had been made aware of the decision. It was fully confirmed that, given the fact that on  August  all the petitioners were members of the executive board, and given the applicability of irremovability as provided in section  of the Organic Labour Law, the employer was obliged to request this labour inspectorate to assess any error, act or omission committed by said workers which could constitute any of the grounds stipulated in section , eiusdem generis the ground invoked by the employer to justify the termination of the employment relationship of the trade union officials given the public interest of the functions performed by these workers, necessarily has to have the prior appraisal and pronouncement of the labour inspector of the respective jurisdiction, in accordance with the provisions of section , eiusdem generis. Those workers invested with immunity from dismissal are in a similar situation, as in the case governed by section , eiusdem generris. (...)By reason of the above and given that both the employment relationship as well as the immunity from dismissal and the dismissal have been fully proven, the labour inspectorate for the eastern part of the metropolitan area of Caracas, in accordance with its legal authority, declares granted the applications for reinstatement and the payment of unpaid wages made on  and  July  by Messrs. Glcido Gutirrez, Juan Bautista Medina, Toms Arencibia, Rubn Gutirrez and Ignacio Daz, against the Eastern Fire Brigade Association, and initially contained in files Nos. - and -. Therefore, the Eastern Fire Brigade Association is ordered to proceed with the immediate reinstatement of the above-mentioned individuals in the posts they occupied before their dismissal and with the same conditions of employment. Likewise, the Eastern Fire Brigade Association is ordered to immediately pay the salaries that said individuals had stopped receiving, calculated from the date of the dismissals and the demotion, that is  July , up until the date of their final reinstatement in their posts. This is decided in accordance with sections , ,  and  of the prevailing Organic Labour Law.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant has alleged: (i) the dismissal of several trade union officials of their organization (in the fire-fighting sector), namely Messrs. Glcido Gutirrez, Rubn Gutirrez, Toms Arencibia and Juan Bautista Medina, and also of a significant number of union members, as well as the transfer of another trade union official (Mr. Ignacio Daz); () that a summons was served on Messrs. Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez to appear before two prefectures under penalty of imprisonment; (c) the existence of a plan by the local and regional authorities to eliminate the complainant trade union and to withdraw its registration.
.The Committee notes the Government's observations, in particular the fact that the Ministry of Labour, through the labour inspectorate, has recognized the trade union rights of the complainant (the right to organize and belong to trade unions, the right to collectively bargain and the right of trade union officials to protection against acts of anti-union discrimination) and has declared invalid the dismissals and transfers of trade union officials belonging to the complainant organization (although, as the complainant points out, the administrative decision handed down by the labour inspectorate has been appealed against before the judicial authority by the employers -- the municipal and provincial authorities of the State of Miranda in this case -- which consider that the fire-fighters are public service employees and work in an institution providing state security and defence which is why, in their view, they should not enjoy trade union rights). The Committee observes that this judicial appeal has had the effect of suspending temporarily the implementation of the order handed down by the labour inspectorate declaring the dismissals and transfers of the trade union officials of the complainant organization invalid.
.In this context, the Committee wishes to refer to the conclusions that it adopted at its November  meeting in a previous case submitted by the same complainant organization when examining allegations relating to restrictions to the union rights of fire-fighters' trade unions that had been adopted on the ground that they were part of a service linked to national defence and security (see th Report, Case No. , paras. -):... the Committee would nevertheless point out that the complainant has expressed its fear that the Act of  respecting the exercise of the occupation of fire-fighter will be interpreted in a way which would deprive fire-fighters of their right to organize and to bargain collectively, rights which they currently enjoy, at least in practice.The Committee points out that it is not for it to determine which labour legislation applies to the different categories of workers and public servants or, more specifically, whether or not certain categories of workers should be governed by special regulations or statutes. Whatever the solution chosen, it is, however, for the Committee to ensure that the workers covered by Conventions Nos.  and  enjoy the rights laid down in these Conventions.The Committee accordingly recalls that under the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ""all public service employees (with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police, as indicated in Article  of Convention No. ), should, like workers in the private sector, be able to establish organizations of their own choosing to further and defend the interests of their members"" (see Digest of decisions and",-1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
289,"principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). More precisely as concerns fire-fighters, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has considered that the functions exercised by this category of public servants should not justify their exclusion from the right to organize (see Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, , para. ).As concerns the right to bargain collectively, the Committee points out that ""all public service workers other than those engaged in the administration of the State should enjoy collective bargaining rights, and priority should be given to collective bargaining as the means to settle disputes arising in connection with the determination of terms and conditions of employment in the public service"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).On the other hand, it is clear to the Committee that fire-fighters constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term and therefore the right to strike can be prohibited for these workers. In the present case, the workers deprived of the right to strike should benefit from appropriate guarantees designed to safeguard their interests. For example, prohibition of the right of lock-out, provision of joint conciliation procedures, and only where conciliation fails, the provision of joint arbitration machinery. (See Digest, op. cit., para .)Taking into account all of these elements, the Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee the maintenance in law and in practice of the recognition of the right to organize and to bargain collectively of fire-fighters, it being understood that the right to strike can be prohibited for these workers. The Committee therefore firmly hopes that no trade union of fire-fighters will be dissolved.
.In these circumstances, the Committee reiterates the conclusions it formulated at its November  meeting recognizing the right of fire-fighters to organize and to bargain collectively, and in accordance with the administrative decision handed down by the labour inspectorate in this matter considers that the dismissed or transferred trade union officials should be reinstated in their former posts. Consequently, the Committee regrets that the judicial authority has provisionally suspended the decision to reinstate the union leaders until the case has been determined on its merits, particularly bearing in mind that this decision was taken immediately after the judicial appeal was instituted, that the dismissals and transfers date back to July  and that, according to the complainant, the judicial proceedings can take a year or more. The Committee therefore requests the Government -- pending the handing down by the judicial authority of its decision -- to guarantee the reinstatement in their posts of the trade union officials of the complainant organization who were dismissed or transferred. Likewise the Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the allegation of arbitrary dismissal of other members of the complainant organization. Furthermore, with reference to the documentation sent by the complainant which states that the local and provincial authorities of the State of Miranda are seeking to eliminate the complainant union, the Committee requests the Government to guarantee the complainant its legal status as a trade union organization.
.The Committee requests the Government to respond to the allegation that, on  and  August , the trade union executives, Messrs. Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez were summoned to appear before the Prefecture of the Paz Castillo Municipality of the State of Miranda and the Prefecture of the Libertador Municipality of the Federal District, under penalty of imprisonment.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a. The Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee the maintenance in law and in practice of the right to organize and to bargain collectively of fire-fighters.b. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee the legal status of the complainant organization as a trade union organization.c. The Committee requests the Government to guarantee the reinstatement in their posts of the trade union officials belonging to the complainant organization who were dismissed or transferred, at least until the judicial authority has handed down its decision in this matter.d. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the alleged arbitrary dismissal of various members of the complainant organization.e. The Committee requests the Government to respond to the allegation that, on  and  August , the trade union executives Messrs. Toms Arencibia and Glcido Gutirrez were summoned to appear before the Prefecture of the Paz Castillo Municipality of the State of Miranda and the Prefecture of the Libertador Municipality of the Federal District under penalty of imprisonment.",1,1998,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
290,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the Trade Union of Professional Fire-Fighters and Allied Workers of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SINPROBOM) dated  September . The organization sent additional information in a communication dated  january .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  September  and  January , the Trade Union of Professional Fire-Fighters and Allied Workers of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SINPROBOM) alleged that in the last two years the Venezuelan authorities have enacted a series of legislative provisions that have the effect of denying fire-fighters the right to organize:- Decree No.  of May  of the Governor of the State of Miranda, which applies to fire-fighters in the service of the local Government of Miranda and which treats them as security personnel who are excluded from the scope of the Organic Labour Act; this was a unilateral act on the part of the regional government and is unconstitutional because the latter is not competent in the matter;- Decree No.  of March  of the President of the Republic, which applies to airborne fire-fighting crews and defines them as a state security body;- the Act of May  respecting the exercise of the occupation of fire-fighter, which provides that ""fire brigades are security bodies"". In his comments to the Congress of the Republic, the President of the Republic stated that ""the Act that has been approved classifies fire brigades as security bodies in the exclusive service of the national interest, as provided in section . The consequence of this classification as security bodies should be that fire-fighters are excluded from the right to organize, since these security bodies are by their very nature subject to special regulations governing their relations with the public administration. This and other opinions might result in acts that are prejudicial to fire-fighters' freedom of association.""
.The complainant adds that on  September  the Sectoral Director-General of the Ministry of Labour sent a circular to all the labour inspectors concerning the legalization of trade unions of public servants, which stated that: ""Inspectors must declare themselves incompetent to legalize trade unions of fire brigades pursuant to section  of the Act respecting the exercise of the occupation of fire-fighter, in conformity with section  of the Organic Labour Act, in as much as since members of the armed forces and national defence and security forces shall not be included in the scope of the Organic Labour Act"" (section  of the latter Act provides that its provisions shall not cover members of services ""responsible for the defence and security of the nation and for the maintenance of public order""). According to the complainant, the intention of this circular is to oblige labour inspectors throughout the country to adopt its official interpretation of the right of fire-fighters to organize, deliberately refusing to issue the certificates of registration of the organizations that the workers in this category choose to form.
.The complainant alleges further that the Autonomous Municipality of Chacao requested the Office of the Legal Adviser of the Ministry of Labour to issue an opinion on fire-fighters' right to freedom of association; the request classifies the occupation of fire-fighter as a security and defence service and considers that they are excluded from the scope of the Organic Labour Act, citing section  of the Act. The complainant points out that according to the request for an opinion, in December  the Ministry of Labour recognized the trade union of the Eastern Fire Brigade Association. However, according to the request, pursuant to the new legislation (the Act respecting the exercise of the occupation of fire-fighter), the legality of the above-mentioned trade union should be clarified and steps taken, if appropriate, to cancel its registration with the Ministry of Labour. This is evidence of the Autonomous Municipality of Chacao's firm intention to initiate a legal procedure aimed at dissolving SINPROBOM by administrative authority. Following this request, the Autonomous Municipality of Chacao requested the labour inspectorate of the eastern district of the metropolitan area to suspend conciliation meetings on a list of demands presented by SINPROBOM in June . The complainant points out that this runs counter to Article  of Convention No. .
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states, with regard to the allegations concerning Decree No.  of the Governor of the State of Miranda that it was true that while the Constitution of the Republic provides that certain rights and guarantees shall be regulated through legislative activity, no other authority may adopt lower ranking legal provisions which encroach on or limit the exercise of constitutional rights. As pointed out by the SINPROBOM, the Governor of the State of Miranda acted unilaterally and hence without the involvement of the national Government; moreover, it had acted unconstitutionally, any person concerned in possession of the rights and right of action conferred on him or her by the internal legal system may request the Supreme Court of Justice to declare the above-mentioned Decree null and void. For this reason, the Government considers that if the complainant's arguments are well founded, there are sufficient legal guarantees laid down to redress the alleged violation committed by the Governor of the State of Miranda by initiating proceedings to declare it null and void on grounds of unconstitutionality. For the same reasons, in their prima facie examination of constitutionality, the labour courts may rule that the above-mentioned Decree does not apply in a given case (known as the ""control difuso"" system of supervision of constitutionality).
.With regard to Decree No.  of the President of the Republic, in reply to the allegations the Government states that the alleged violation of freedom of association is only apparent, since the exclusion of only airborne fire-fighters could affect only one part of the exercise of the fire-fighting occupation which involves the performance of a vital service (tasks relating to air traffic control), not the occupation as a whole. In other words, since air traffic control is a service affecting the life and safety of the population, restriction of the exercise of the right to organize in the aviation sector could not be interpreted as a violation of the SINPROBOM's right to freedom of association, since its members do not even work in the airborne service.
.As regard the allegations concerning the Act respecting the exercise of the occupation of fire-fighter, the Government recalls that based on the provisions of the Act, which classifies fire brigades as security bodies, and in conformity with section  of the Organic Labour Act, the Venezuelan public authorities allegedly argued that fire-fighters should be excluded from the scope of the Organic Labour Act and therefore should not enjoy the right to freedom of association; according to the complainant, these opinions might result in specific acts of this category of workers or public servants which would be prejudicial to fire-fighters' right of freedom of association.
.In this respect, the Government points out that the complainant uses the term ""might"", which implies something that could potentially occur in the future, and until now the labour administration has recognized SINPROBOM's freedom of association, since this organization exists legally (it has been formally registered by the Ministry of Labour); its capacity to negotiate collective agreements (registered with the Ministry of Labour) and to handle lists of demands has been recognized; the protection afforded by law in the form of what is known as trade union immunity has been recognized (the Ministry of Labour has instituted proceedings for reinstatement and payment of unpaid wages), etc. None the less, the Government explains that at the initiative of the fire-fighters' union itself a Bill was submitted to the Congress of the Republic which, once it had been approved by both houses of the legislature and entered into force ( May ), provided that fire brigades are considered as security bodies, which introduced the possibility of interpreting the law as meaning that fire brigades are excluded from the scope of the Organic Labour Act (section ).
.As regards the allegations concerning the Autonomous Municipality of Chacao, the Government states that the complainant has merely expressed opinions and value judgements that do not correspond to reality. Specifically, the request to cancel the trade union registration of SINPROBOM was rejected by the office of the Ministry of Labour from which it was requested, since it would mean the administrative dissolution of the trade union, which is prohibited by Convention No. .
.The Government concludes by pointing out that notwithstanding the above, the Ministry of Labour has begun talks with the officers of SINPROBOM with a view to clarifying the content of their arguments and seeking a concerted solution to the problem that has arisen.
.The Committee notes that, in this case, the complainant alleges that, in",0,1996,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
291,"considering fire-fighters as members of security staff, the legislation excludes this category of public workers from the scope of application of the Organic Labour Act and thus from the right to organize and to bargain collectively. More precisely, the complainant alleges that the municipality of Chacao requested the Labour Minister to clarify the legal nature of the fire-fighters' union. For the complainant, this proves that the municipality in question has the intention of requesting the union's dissolution.
.The Committee notes that the Government in its reply states that up to the present time, the organization enjoys legal personality and has had its capacity to carry out collective bargaining recognized. Moreover, the Government indicated that the authorities have refused to annul the union registration of the complainant.
.While noting these indications, the Committee would nevertheless point out that the complainant has expressed its fear that the Act of  respecting the exercise of the occupation of fire-fighter will be interpreted in a way which would deprive fire-fighters of their right to organize and to bargain collectively, rights which they currently enjoy, at least in practice.
.The Committee points out that it is not for it to determine which labour legislation applies to the different categories of workers and public servants or, more specifically, whether or not certain categories of workers should be governed by special regulations or statues. Whatever the solution chosen, it is, however, for the Committee to ensure that the workers covered by Conventions Nos.  and  enjoy the rights laid down in these Conventions.
.The Committee accordingly recalls that under the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ""all public service employees (with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police, as indicated in Article  of Convention No. ), should, like workers in the private sector, be able to establish organizations of their own choosing to further and defend the interests of their members"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee of the Governing Body of the ILO, th edition, , para. ). More precisely as concerns fire-fighters, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has considered that the functions exercised by this category of public servants should not justify their exclusion from the right to organize (see Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, , para. ).
.As concerns the right to bargain collectively, the Committee points out that ""all public service workers other than those engaged in the administration of the State should enjoy collective bargaining rights, and priority should be given to collective bargaining as the means to settle disputes arising in connection with the determination of terms and conditions of employment in the public service"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.On the other hand, it is clear to the Committee that fire-fighters constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term and therefore the right to strike can be prohibited for these workers. In the present case, the workers deprived of the right to strike should benefit from appropriate guarantees designed to safeguard their interests. For example, prohibition of the right of lock-out, provision of joint conciliation procedures, and only where conciliation fails, the provision of joint arbitration machinery. (See Digest, op. cit., para. .)
.Taking into account all of these elements, the Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee the maintenance in law and in practice of the recognition of the right to organize and to bargain collectively of fire-fighters, it being understood that the right to strike can be prohibited for these workers. The Committee therefore firmly hopes that no trade union of fire-fighters will be dissolved.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee the maintenance in law and in practice of the right to organize and to bargain collectively of fire-fighters, it being understood that the right to strike can be prohibited for these workers. In this case, the workers deprived of the right to strike should benefit from appropriate guarantees designed to safeguard their interests.(b) The Committee expresses the firm hope that no trade union of fire-fighters will be dissolved.(c) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this case.",-1,1996,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
292,".At its meetings in June  and March  (see th Report, para. , and th Report, para. ), when it examined allegations concerning the arbitrary detention of Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco, President of the Single Grass-Roots Union of Workers of the Department of Education (SUBATRA), the Committee noted that the judicial authorities had decided to release Mr. Pacheco while an investigation continued concerning falsification of documents which he was alleged to have committed (the case remaining open until such time as responsibility for the offence could be determined, given that there is evidence that a criminal act was committed, although the identity of the culprit has not yet been established). The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the results of these judicial proceedings.
.In a communication of  October , the Government attaches for the Committee's attention a communication from the President and the Secretary of SUBATRA. It requests the Committee to close the case, since Mr. Pacheco, the former President, was expelled from the union by the general assembly of municipal education workers. The Government considers that, in the light of this letter, the case lacks any elements which would justify continued examination.
.The Committee takes note of this information. However, bearing in mind that the issue pending in this case concerns proceedings against a trade union official for alleged falsification of documents and that it is not clear that these proceedings are related to the official's subsequent expulsion from the union, the Committee reiterates its demand that the Government should inform it of the results of the proceedings against the former union leader Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Single Grass-roots Union of Workers of the Department of Education (SUBATRA), dated  July . The Government replied in a communication dated  September .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  July , the Single Grass-roots Union of Workers of the Department of Education (SUBATRA) alleges the arbitrary detention of Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco, President of SUBATRA, on  July , and his being placed in the custody of the Technical Corps of the Judicial Police for having allegedly provided or issued irregular documentation (academic reports or certificates) with alteration of signatures to an individual who had applied to enter the police force of Sucre Municipality, the same individual who attributed these acts (falsification of documents) to the President of SUBATRA. The Technical Corps of the Judicial Police carried out an investigation in this connection, summoned the President of SUBATRA, detained him, and transmitted the corresponding legal case to the legal authorities on  July .
.The complainant explains that the police force of Sucre Municipality is hierarchically subordinate to the Mayor of the said municipality, from whom it receives direct instructions, and that it is precisely this police corps that played a decisive role in the submission and investigation of the ""evidence"" which seeks to implicate the President of SUBATRA as responsible for the falsification of documents. The complainant adds that the Mayor of Sucre Municipality is also the employer of the teachers, and that there are serious grounds for conjecturing that his intervention was decisive in the detention of the President of SUBATRA. In this connection, the organization refers to the anti-union attitude and to conflicts between the Mayor's Office of Sucre Municipality and SUBATRA from  until the date of the detention of the President of this organization, which included strikes, demonstrations and public meetings.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that in this case there does not appear to be a violation of the exercise of freedom of association - or of any of its essential tenets - through a supposedly arbitrary detention. Firstly, the acts noted by the complainant assume the complicity and arbitrary approach of three discrete and independent bodies which discharged certain duties in the prosecution of a person suspected of having committed criminal acts (local preventive police, investigative police attached to the criminal justice service, and the criminal justice courts).
.Specifically, the Government states that even according to the complainant union (SUBATRA), Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco was detained by the local police of Sucre Municipality (police force with authority limited to the district of Sucre in the State of Miranda) and placed in the custody of the Technical Corps of the Judicial Police, this latter being the investigative police body with national authority, appointed to the Ministry of Justice. Likewise, his case was sent to the criminal justice courts, since there was evidence which implicated him in offences related to forging or falsification of documents (all of the above happened between  and  July , according to SUBATRA).
.As can be seen, both the police investigative body and the entity with jurisdiction for criminal prosecution act under the auspices of the national public power, the first within the national executive and the second within the judiciary; while the Mayor's Office of Sucre Municipality, and its police force, act only at the municipal level. Thus, in the national political system, it is sought, through the ""constitutional separation of powers"" (legislative, judicial and executive) and their ""territorial levels of organization"" (national, state and municipal), to guarantee the independence and autonomy of the separate branches which make up the State. This situation affects all the bodies, including those which, as in the case at hand, act in a situation where there is the suspicion of a violation of national legislation through the commission of a punishable act.
.The Government points out that according to legislation in force in the country, the procedure to follow in such cases - as SUBATRA pointed out - consists in carrying out the preventive detention of the implicated suspect, according to section (H) of the Institution of Criminal Proceedings Code, in order that, in a previously determined time period - eight days - the court appointed to the case can pronounce on the detention order (judicial order for detention), or the release of the suspect if it is considered that there is not sufficient evidence to justify the continued detention of the individual. It is worth saying that Venezuelan legislation is very closely linked to the principles of the guarantee of due process and of the rights to defence, since the individual can only be held in preventive detention for eight days (a period which it is deemed reasonable to consider as not constituting any kind of infringement prejudicial to personal freedom), to be subsequently remanded to the custody of the body with the appropriate jurisdiction, which will determine the existence of the legal grounds for the institution of legal proceedings against the suspect implicated in a punishable act.
.On the other hand, the Government clarifies that any citizen has adequate guarantees established by domestic legislation to bring into play the machinery of the bodies for protection with jurisdiction in cases where arbitrary acts could be committed, guarantees on which Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco, like any other inhabitant of the country, can count. To this effect, since constitutional rights are in question: personal freedom (article  of the Constitution of the Republic of Venezuela) and freedom of association (article ), the appropriate thing to do would be the exercise of a common appeal, which is granted by the Institution of Criminal Proceedings Code, or the quicker and more efficient means of a suit for habeas corpus, provided for in the constitutional appeal law on constitutional rights and guarantees, with the aim of immediately re-establishing the legal situation which has been infringed.
.In the case in question, the above-mentioned police forces limited themselves solely to acting on the basis of the legal framework which confers their authority; for this reason it is difficult to sustain the view that the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , or any other norm in force in the Republic, has been transgressed in any way. The exercise of trade union activities can never imply that a person cannot be prosecuted when found accused of an act which may be punishable. Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco was detained because another citizen indicated him as the person who had provided him with a forged or falsified public document in exchange for money. The Technical Corps of the Judicial Police, having been acquainted with this indication, and once the tests had been carried out which determined the falsity of the document which originated from the administrative section in which Mr. Pacheco worked, proceeded with his detention in order to immediately put him in the custody of the criminal justice courts. The correctness of the procedure which was followed is thus evident; nevertheless, if Mr. Pacheco had not committed any offence, there would have been no grounds for continuing his criminal prosecution, and like any individual he would have been immediately released, a responsibility which devolves to the judiciary. To this effect, the information",1,1996,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
293,"which is available on this case indicates that Mr. Pacheco was released - in this way the exercise of his union functions was not impaired - and that a judicial investigation stage is still under way, since there is evidence that an offence was committed.
.The Committee observes that the complainant teaching organization alleges the arbitrary detention of Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco, President of SUBATRA, and points out that the police corps which played a decisive role in the submission and investigation of the ""evidence"" for presumed falsification of academic documents by Mr. Pacheco, is hierarchically subordinate to the Mayor of Sucre Municipality, employer of the teachers. According to the allegations, the said detention constituted a reprisal for the union activities of the President of SUBATRA. The Committee observes that the Government has emphasized the legality and correctness of the procedures and the methods adopted in connection with Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco and pointed out that this union officer was released, that the exercise of his union functions was not impaired, and that the case is in the investigation stage since evidence does exist that an offence was committed (forging or falsification of documents). The Committee takes note that the Government denies the alleged complicity between separate bodies against Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco and points out in this connection that such bodies act in separate spheres (national, state and municipal) precisely in order to guarantee their independence and autonomy.
.In these circumstances, in order to be able to make a definitive pronouncement on this issue, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the criminal proceedings against the union officer Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco for suspected falsification of documents.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the criminal proceedings against the union officer Mr. Jos Ramn Pacheco for suspected falsification of documents.",1,1996,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
294,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Federation of Professional Pilots Trade Unions of Venezuela (FESPAVEN) dated  April . FESPAVEN sent additional information in a communication dated  May .
.The Government forwarded its observations concerning the allegations in a communication dated  May .
.At its June  meeting, the Committee decided to ask the complainant for additional information so as to be able to pronounce itself on the admissibility of the complaint. However, no information has been received in this respect from the complainant.
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  April  and  May , the Federation of Professional Pilots Trade Unions of Venezuela (FESPAVEN) alleges that the legal regulation of labour relations in aviation enterprises such as Avensa, which employ pilots and flight attendants, is in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Organization Act. Individual contracts of employment are concluded between the staff and the airline, the latter also benefiting from collective labour agreements, made possible by trade unions which group together the various categories of workers. It states that Avensa set up an enterprise -- with the same shareholders and the same chairman as itself -- called Servivensa, as a type of subsidiary cunningly intended to sidestep labour rights. It is important to note that it was set up with a capital of Bs.,, which is unusual for an aviation enterprise; and even stranger still is the fact that it has no flight crews. To enable Servivensa to fly its planes, it always has to go via three commercial enterprises to have access to aviation workers.
.The complainant explains that Servivensa (the enterprise set up by Avensa) obtains its flight crews from a company which supplies ""manpower"" called SAJG.SA; but SAJG.SA does not have any flight crews either, just a list of service providers (pilots and flight attendants). The aviation service providers are not aviation workers either; they are companies made up of pilots and flight attendants who are either shareholders or workers. This last point is key to understanding what is really happening: a pilot or flight attendant wanting to work with Servivensa (or to fly with this company's planes) must set up a company of his own. Thus, when the worker goes on board, he is being sent by a company -- his own -- to SAJG.SA, which in turn is sending him to Servivensa.
.The complainant points out the consequences of this procedure. Servivensa claims that no employment relationship exists between itself and its flight personnel. Therefore it does not pay the benefits established by law nor are its staff affiliated to the Compulsory Social Security scheme, nor are there any restrictions on their hours of work. The workers are not considered to be workers but rather commercial enterprises, and in that capacity they can neither form unions nor bargain collectively. They must pay for their own uniforms and overnight stays, they have no insurance, etc. Their remuneration is on a piece-work basis. Thus, the prevailing collective agreement is replaced by individual commercial contracts and the Trade Union Association of Avensa Pilots (ASPA) and the Association of Unionized Flight Attendants of Avensa (ADAS) are eliminated.
.In addition, considerable pressure has been brought to bear by Avensa representatives to set up an entity to replace the executive committee of ASPA and ADAS by persons of trust from Avensa, who will oversee the transition towards individual contracts. In this connection, a joint meeting was held on  February  by ASPA and ADAS in the city of Caracas which was attended by the head of security of Avensa, together with a group of pilots, flight attendants and trusted staff, all transported in vehicles belonging to the employer. The employer's representative blatantly told everyone present that the enterprise would not negotiate on any point with the legitimately established executive committees of the unions and that it demanded the resignation of both committees. He then immediately left the meeting, forcing a group of union members to do likewise, threatening them with dismissal and discrimination if they supported the union.
.According to the complainant, this anti-labour policy has already managed to neutralize the trade union movement through the support of an ASPA executive committee. It can now do whatever it likes without the authorities blinking an eye. ASPA's trade union executives have become employers by setting up an organization called ASPA Rent Crew, which shamelessly offers the services of a number of pilots, who they say will work without making any labour demands and outside the sphere of the unions and the protection of collective bargaining. In this case the trade union leaders are positioning themselves outside the scope of the Labour Organization Act. This type of management favours the employer.
.The complainant describes the telling case of Captains Vicente Grisanti and Herrman Alexandre. Their flying hours have been reduced and they currently earn a monthly basic wage without the wage increments associated with actual flying as they have not agreed to the enterprise's approach and they oppose the deterioration in collective rights. Since the second fortnight in December  to date, these pilots have not been able to exercise their trade union activity owing to the irregular situation prevailing in Avensa, and less still have been able to represent the ASPA, as the conditions are entirely inappropriate to do so. These pilots are members of FESPAVEN and they have insisted on the applicability of labour legislation and have refused to become limited companies.
.Lastly, the complainant encloses a report from a special committee of the Chamber of Deputies, dated February , relating to these issues where it is indicated in particular that in order to avoid the application of prevailing collective agreements, the Avensa-Servivensa Group has substituted the contracting of its workers by an employment relationship which consists of obliging the crews of an airline (Servivensa) to set up commercial companies. According to this report, the labour scheme applied at Servivensa is a step backwards in workers' conditions of employment, given that it substitutes collective contracting by individual agreements between the employer and the worker.
.In a communication of  May , the Government sent a report from the legal adviser to the Ministry of Labour concerning the legal status of the individual employment contracts of the pilots and flight attendants of Servivensa. The report indicates that a practice exists of concluding contracts (civil or commercial) instead of contracts of employment or obliging workers to establish their own enterprises as a sham aimed at avoiding the application of the labour and social security laws. The labour law has effective mechanisms to eliminate such practices. The fact that Servivensa did not force the pilots and flight attendants to conclude the commercial contracts does not alter these conclusions. According to the report, the establishment of Servivensa -- a subsidiary of Avensa -- with the objective of undertaking the same activities as Servivensa, with the same routes and offering technical assistance on the flights, and the conclusion of sham commercial labour contracts, is an effective anti-union practice. In addition, the shareholders of Avensa, acting through Servivensa, guarantee the execution of the air transport of persons and goods, these activities not being covered by the labour and social security legislation. This procedure, as well as impeding the exercise of trade union activities in the enterprise, undermines effective collective bargaining and ignores the existence of the trade union within Avensa.
.The Government states that an employers' representative, having been granted the right to speak, with the consent of ASPA and ADAS, was present at the trade union meeting referred to by FESPAVEN. In these circumstances, it could not be considered a question of employer interference, even if in the course of speaking he had made anti-union statements. In such a case, the union representatives could have, if they deemed it appropriate, refuted these comments.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant has alleged: () that the employment contracts of pilots and flight crews of Avensa and the collective agreement have been replaced by individual contracts of a commercial nature, eliminating collective bargaining and the trade unions ASPA and ADAS; () that Avensa representatives interfered in trade union meetings to put pressure on union members to favour individual commercial contracts and a trade union executive committee in support of Avensa's goals; () that two pilots have suffered discrimination for not accepting individual contracts. The Committee notes the response of the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the Trade Union Association of Avensa Pilots (ASPA) and the Association of Unionized Flight Attendants of Avensa (ADAS), members of the complainant (FESPAVEN), had presented the complaint in conjunction with FESPAVEN, but had subsequently withdrawn it as indicated in communications dated  February and  January , respectively. This being the case, before deciding whether to examine the substance of the case, the Committee had considered that it was necessary to determine whether FESPAVEN still had",0,1995,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
295,"a direct interest in the issues it had submitted to the Committee (see Procedure for the examination of complaints alleging violations of freedom of association, para. ), now that its member organizations had withdrawn themselves from the proceeding, taking into account above all that FESPAVEN states that ASPA's executives ""have become employers by setting up an organization called ASPA Rent Crew"". The Committee observes that the Office had asked FESPAVEN in a communication dated  June  to indicate whether ASPA and ADAS still belonged to it and to specify all the other trade union organizations which also belonged to it as well as the number of pilots and flight attendants it represented. The Committee also notes that the complainant still has not furnished this information after having been asked to do so nine months ago.
.In these conditions, and although the Government in its reply recognizes the existence of anti-union practices and other practices contrary to collective bargaining, the Committee considers that since it has not received the additional information requested from the complainant so as to decide on the admissibility of the complaint, it is not in a position to examine this case further.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that it is not in a position to examine this case further.",-1,1995,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
296,".The complaints are contained in communications from the Federation of Aeronautical Trade Unions of Venezuela (FGAV) dated  and  April . The FGAV sent additional information in communications dated  June and  July . The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) endorsed the FGAV's complaint in a communication dated  June .
.Due to the lack of information from the Government on the allegations, the Committee had to postpone consideration of this case on three occasions. At its March  meeting, the Committee drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, it would submit a report on the substance of the matter at its next meeting, even if the information and observations awaited from the Government had not been received in due time (see nd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ), para. ). The Government's observations have still not been received.
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  and  April,  June and  July , the Federation of Aeronautical Trade Unions of Venezuela (FGAV) explains that since February , the following trade unions of public officials attached to the Ministry of Transport and Communications have been involved in a dispute: air traffic controllers, aeronautical telecommunications operators, radiocommunications technicians, aeronautical fire-fighters, flight dispatchers, rescue workers, aviation mechanics inspectors, aeronautical information technicians and airport managers (all of these activities come under the Air Navigation Control Services). At the heart of the dispute is the Government's failure to respect standards and agreements on working conditions and air safety, technical conditions relating to the proper exercise of the functions of air traffic controllers, failure to pay a standard allowance to officials in the Central Administration and to adhere to the scales of remuneration and social benefits (established in Decrees Nos. , and , of  December ), in respect of sums due for the termination of employment relationships (social security benefits), retirement and survivors' pensions.
.The complainant adds that on  April , the FGAV and the other unions affected submitted a list of demands to the Ministry of Labour which was left pending for nine months. The Ministry merely suggested that the parties should accept voluntary arbitration, thus failing to respect its obligation to initiate the bargaining process.
.The complainant points out that the failure to respect agreements entered into, as reflected in the failure to maintain and update systems and equipment, thereby jeopardizing safety conditions and measures, forced the unions, following certain strictly technical abnormalities and with a view to protecting the life and safety of users of the aeronautical services, to apply the Manual of General Procedures, No.  (PG. ), which corresponds exactly to document No.  of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which is applicable to Venezuela. Several days before the provisions of the manual were applied, the authorities and the public were notified through the media. The consequences of its application were explained as was the fact that there would inevitably be delays. However, it was also stated that the provisions of the manual had to be applied since in the event of an accident, ultimate responsibility would fall to the controllers and aeronautical staff. In other words, although the situation prior to the application of the Manual of General Procedures, No.  seemed ""normal"", there is no doubt that there were and are irregularities compromising the responsibility of air traffic controllers. It is therefore not true that the aeronautical unions, and the air traffic controllers in particular, called a go-slow (which is how the Executive described the protest) which deliberately disrupted flight schedules. Any delays in take-offs and landings are due to the application of an internationally recognized manual of procedures to which recourse was made in an effort to minimize danger to the lives of crew members and passengers and the risk of technical failure. It must be pointed out that at no time was the dispute intended to disrupt air traffic, nor was the latter paralysed.
.The complainant adds that the labour dispute met with systematic anti-union repression, including:- the occupation of workplaces by the military and the police who used force to remove the workers ( February ), the military take-over of  national airports, and the subsequent order for the workers' return;- the suspension of wages of aeronautical staff ( March ), a punitive measure to force the protesters to work according to the orders and command of military officials and the air force;- the temporary detention by the authorities of  workers involved in the dispute (the names are provided by the complainant);- the transformation of air traffic control and navigation services into a state security force, under the control of the Ministry of Defence; the services involved include air traffic controllers, aeronautical radiocommunications technicians, aeronautical telecommunications operators, aeronautical fire-fighters, aeronautical information technicians, aviation mechanics inspectors, rescue workers, aeronautical operations technicians and the pilots of rescue planes, attached to the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications (Decree No.  of  March ). This Decree undermines the right to collective bargaining, to submit list of demands and the search for a peaceful solution to labour disputes.
.The complainant points out that the background to the dispute is the Suspension of Constitutional Guarantees, i.e. the state of emergency that has been in force since  June . Since constitutional guarantees have been suspended, in an attempt to tackle the economic and financial crisis caused by banking fraud and its social consequences, controls have also been imposed on the world of work which, irrespective of the fact that there is no legal foundation, have been used to limit the exercise of the right to strike in both the private sector and the public administration. The complainant refers to an administrative practice which ignores the right to strike on the part of labour inspectors contrary to the Constitution and the law.
.The complainant refers to various legal measures taken with regard to the issues raised in this case, in particular to overturn the decision to suspend public officials' wages and salaries and to have Ministerial Decree No.  declared null and void. In respect of this Decree, the complainant organization refers to the conclusions of the Office of Investigation and Legal Consultancy of the Congress of the Republic which state that:
.""Decree No.  has no ... valid legal foundation. It has no legal standing since its enactment is shrouded in total incompetence, and insofar as it relates to matters that should be dealt with solely by the law, it has invalidated the competence of another state power: the Legislature"".
.""Decree No.  is invalid in that it constitutes a misuse of power, since the administration is endeavouring to use its powers for purposes that were not intended and acting on considerations that have nothing to do with the interests of the service"".
.""Decree No.  is unlawful since its contents violate the provisions of sections ,  and  of the Civil Aviation Act which grants civilian status to the aeronautical services"".
.""The Decree is furthermore unconstitutional in that it violates the principle of legal reserve, since the status of a state security body must be conferred by legislation, with account being taken of the nature of the body. Such legal status cannot be imposed or granted by a decree of the National Executive and even less by an open-ended article which leaves it to the discretion of two Ministries to determine the criteria to be adopted"".
.""The Decree in question also violates the provisions of article  () of the Constitution in that it amends a public service on the basis of a Decree without the authorization of the delegated Commission or a specific Act"".
.""In the view of this Office this instrument is ... seriously flawed and totally null and void, and therefore, may be overturned in the courts"".
.The complainant organization also states that public officials involved in the conflict have been threatened with dismissal. In this respect, the Ministry of Transport and Communications has pointed out that  per cent of the controllers will not be reinstated in their posts and has now suggested that workers should be reinstated gradually, but that union leaders should not be returned to their posts. This position clearly shows that the National Executive has compiled ""blacklists"" as a measure of reprisal. The Ministry has also publicly announced the opening of courses to train new applicants to the posts of air traffic controllers, aeronautical telecommunications operators and aeronautical telecommunications technicians, which shows that the Government intends to carry on replacing the workers involved in the dispute.
.First of all, the Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not sent the observations or information requested on the allegations that remained outstanding, despite the time that has elapsed since the complaint was made and",0,1995,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
297,"despite the fact that it was invited to make comments and observations on several occasions, including in an urgent appeal.
.In these circumstances, and in accordance with the relevant rule of procedure (see para.  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee is obliged to submit a report on the substance of the case even though it is unable to take account of the information it was hoping to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward (see st Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee notes that in this case, the complainant organization has alleged that the Government has taken reprisals against trade unions as a result of a labour dispute in February  and of the trade union actions taken in the air traffic control sector. The complainant organization specifically objects to, amongst others, the military take-over of national airports, the suspension of wages and the temporary detention of a number of  workers (whose names were provided by the complainant), threats of dismissal made against employees who took part in the dispute, to replace workers involved in the dispute, including union leaders, the transformation of the air navigation services into a state security service under the Ministry of Defence pursuant to Ministerial Decree No.  of March .
.The Committee notes that the alleged reprisals which occurred following the application by the staff of the air navigation control services of the Manual of General Procedures No.  resulted in practice in delays in the arrival and departure of flights. The Committee notes that the complainant denies that a ""go-slow"" was ordered and points out that the application of the above-mentioned manual was due to safety reasons.
.Taking into account all the elements and in particular the fact that the application of the manual occurred during the course of a labour dispute, the Committee concludes that the trade unions concerned had recourse in practice to an atypical form of strike which, depending on the point of view adopted, could be described as a work-to-rule or go-slow. The Committee also notes that the Organic Labour Law does not exclude the right to strike to staff responsible for air navigation control; however, the complainant mentioned an administrative practice by the labour inspectors which is contrary to the right to strike, the Constitution and the law, and emphasizes the suspension of constitutional guarantees from June .
.In these circumstances, the Committee believes that the measures adopted by the authorities when the trade unions applied the Manual of General Procedures No.  (military occupation of airports, suspension of wages, temporary arrests, threat of dismissals, transformation of the air navigation services into a state security body, etc.) were excessive. The Committee recalls that at all events any sanction imposed in respect of activities related to strikes should be proportional to the offence committed and that the authorities should exclude recourse to detention measures against persons organizing or participating in a peaceful strike.
.The Committee calls on the Government to resume collective bargaining with a view to finding a negotiated solution to the dispute in the air navigation control sector, which guarantees the respect of trade union rights to staff in the sector - including the right to the collective bargaining of their conditions of employment - and to ensure that Decree No. , which transforms the staff in question to a state security body, lapses as soon as possible.",1,1995,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
298,".During its last examination of this case by the Committee in June  (see th Report, paras. -), an allegation remained pending concerning the closure of the Editores El Nuevo Pais CA for a false financial crisis and returning to publish the newspaper El Nuevo Pais one month later with a different staff, in the absence of any trade union or collective agreement. The Committee made the following recommendation: ""The Committee considers that the closure of Editores El Nuevo Pais CA may have been for anti-union reasons and calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry in this regard and, if such intentions are proven, to take measures, through legal proceedings, to compensate the National Press Trade Union and its former members in the enterprise concerned for the prejudice sustained, including by reinstating them in their jobs if they so wish. The Committee requests to be kept informed in this regard.""
.In a communication dated  June , the Government stated that as soon as the discussions concerning the draft collective labour agreement between the National Press Trade Union (SNTP) and Editores El Nuevo Pais, which lasted six months, arrived at an impasse, the union requested that the conciliation discussions be turned into dispute proceedings against the company. In the meantime, the company was closed for reasons of a financial nature. During the negotiations within the dispute proceedings, once the Conciliation Board was named, the workers put an end to their relationship with the company, reaching a compromise settlement (with final legal effect), in conformity with the Basic Labour Act. As a result, these workers were dismissed with compensation, as the settlement had been approved by the Labour Inspectorate (a copy of the labour settlement was attached).
.The Committee takes note of this information. Nevertheless, the Committee insists on the importance of carrying out investigations into complaints of discriminatory practice in order to redress any wrongs if their anti-union nature is proven and to apply the sanctions provided in the legislation.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Press Trade Union dated  February .
.Given the Government's failure to reply to the allegations, the Committee has had to postpone the examination of this case on four occasions. At its meeting in March  the Committee drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th meeting (November ), it would present a report on the substance of this case at its next meeting, even if the observations or information requested from the Government had not been received in due time (see nd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ), para. ). To date, no observations have been received from the Government.
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the National Press Trade Union (SNTP) alleges that on  November  it submitted a draft collective agreement to the labour inspectorate to be discussed, in a conciliatory way, with the enterprise ""Editores El Nuevo Pas C.A."" (publishing house for the daily newspaper El Nuevo Pas). Negotiations took place, with many ups and downs, for six months without resulting in an agreement, because of the refusal on the employer's side to meet the workers' basic demands. Given these circumstances, on  May  the SNTP requested the labour inspectorate, in accordance with sections  et seq. of the Labour Code, to deal with the demands made in the draft collective agreement as if there were a dispute. In reply to this request, the labour inspectorate handed down a decision on the same date which, instead of setting in motion the corresponding legal proceedings, ordered the opening of ""a round of conciliatory discussions between the parties, of a preliminary nature"", thus preventing the start of the period of  hours required by the Venezuelan labour legislation before a strike may be declared. From that time onwards, a new, protracted and complicated compulsory ""conciliation"" procedure was initiated, during which the employer, when he attended the meetings, used the same arguments he had put forward during the previous months. All the requests made by the SNTP to initiate proceedings to be able to declare a strike were refused, on the grounds that ""the conditions within the country were not propitious for strikes"". According to the complainant organization, the employer meanwhile had enough time to draw up a plan allowing him to make adjustments to the bookkeeping to feign a financial crisis and resort to a closure as a means of preventing his workers from exercising their trade union rights. Indeed, on  November , the SNTP received a communication signed by the employer's legal representative, informing it that the enterprise's activities would cease from  December  onwards and that the workers would be laid off or dismissed. The complainant organization adds that only when it had received a similar communication did the Ministry of Labour order the labour inspector (the official who was originally in charge of the case) ""to admit"" the dispute nature of the list of claims and to initiate the corresponding proceedings - this was on  December, two days before the closure of the enterprise and seven months since the list of claims was first submitted to set in motion proceedings for a collective dispute; the legal proceedings were therefore only set in motion once the strike had lost any meaning.
.The complainant organization also alleges that, as was to be expected, the employer did not take any notice of such proceedings and, on the date mentioned above, closed the gates of the enterprise, compelling the workers to apply on the following days for the compensation to which, according to the employer, they were entitled. One month after the fraudulent closure, work in the enterprise was resumed and the newspaper El Nuevo Pas was published once more - obviously with a different staff (the employment relationships of  journalists and photographers were terminated), in the absence of any trade union or collective agreement. Finally, the complainant organization stresses that the legislation imposes a long and intolerable conciliation process which prevents the exercise of the right to strike.
.First of all, the Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not communicated the observations or information requested on the allegations pending, in spite of the time which has elapsed since the complaint was submitted and the fact that it was requested to submit observations or information on a number of occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal.
.In these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable procedural rules (see para.  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee finds itself obliged to submit a report on the substance of this case without being able to take account of the information it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade unions in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, these must for their part recognize the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward (see First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that the legal proceedings for conciliation between the parties during collective bargaining is protracted and intolerable and prevents the exercise of the right to strike; it also alleges the closure by the enterprise ""Editores El Nuevo Pas C.A."" (false financial crisis) - after the statutory period of conciliation had been extended under a decision handed down by the administrative authority - which published the newspaper El Nuevo Pas one month later with a different staff, in the absence of any trade union or collective agreement.
.Regarding the complainant's allegation that the conciliation procedure is too long, the Committee notes that section  of the Labour Code stipulates that a trade union's right to submit a list of demands when it deems it appropriate shall in no event be curtailed during the collective bargaining process and that section  concerning the conciliation procedure states that the workers concerned shall not suspend their collective labour for at least  hours from the time they submit their list of demands. The Committee considers that these provisions are not incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee nevertheless wishes to draw attention to the complainant's claim that, although a list of demands was submitted on  May , the Labour Inspectorate suspended the count of the  hours prior to which a strike may not be called, initiated conciliatory discussions and rejected the union's various petitions to call a strike; it",-1,1995,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
299,"only ""recognized"" the conflictual nature of the list of demands on  December . On this point, the Committee wishes to observe that the requirements for calling a strike in a non-essential service must be reasonable and that an excessively protracted conciliation procedure does restrict trade union action and may even render a legal strike impossible in practice. The Committee recalls that conciliation procedures for facilitating collective bargaining or dispute settlement should be speedy and impartial and leave open the possibility of resorting to strike action after a reasonable period of time; such was not the case in this instance between May and November , despite the fact that ""Editores El Nuevo Pas C.A."" is not an essential service. The Committee calls on the Government to ensure that in future the duration of the conciliation procedure preceding the calling of a strike complies strictly with the provisions of the law, i.e. the  hour-period stipulated in section  of the Labour Code which should not be extended unilaterally.
.Regarding the alleged closure of ""Editores El Nuevo Pas C.A."" on the pretext of a financial crisis, the Committee notes that according to the complainant publication of the newspaper El Nuevo Pas was resumed with a different staff, in the absence of any trade union (since the employment relationship of the former workers had been terminated) or collective agreement. The Committee emphasizes that, in these circumstances and in the absence of any reply from the Government, the revival one month later with a new staff of an enterprise that had been closed can hardly be seen as a coincidence unrelated to trade union activities. Consequently, the Committee considers that the closure of ""Editores El Nuevo Pas C.A."" may have been for anti-union reasons and calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry in this respect and if such intentions are proven to take measures to compensate, through legal proceedings, the National Press Trade Union and its former members in the enterprise concerned for the prejudice sustained, including by reinstating them in their jobs if they so wish. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee calls on the Government to ensure that in future the duration of the conciliation procedure preceding the calling of a strike complies strictly with the provisions of the law, i.e. the  hour-period stipulated in section  of the Labour Code which should not be extended unilaterally.(b) The Committee considers that the closure of ""Editores El Nuevo Pas C.A."" may have been for anti-union reasons and calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry in this regard and, if such intentions are proven, to take measures, through legal proceedings, to compensate the National Press Trade Union and its former members in the enterprise concerned for the prejudice sustained, including by reinstating them in their jobs if they so wish. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",-1,1995,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
300,".In its last examination of the case in March  (see th Report, paras. -), when it considered allegations concerning interference by an employer in the establishment of a trade union, the Committee requested the Government to carry out an investigation into the alleged presence of representatives of the company CORAVEN-RCTV at the constituent meeting of the trade union SINATRAINCORACTEL and alleged threats to dismiss workers who refused to join the new union, and to keep it informed of developments as soon as possible; and, considering it necessary to have the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice on the matter that had given rise to the complaint, the Committee requested the Government to send it a text of this ruling.
.In communications dated  and  October , the Government indicates that the legal representative of the trade union SRTVA sent a communication stating that the organization did indeed initiate proceedings before the Supreme Court of Justice to have the act of registration of the National Trade Union of Workers at CORAVEN-RCTV annulled, but the application was never actually lodged and the act of registration therefore remained in force. In the light of this, the legal representative considers that the complaint brought by the SRTVA before the Committee should be set aside. Given this information from the legal representative of the SRTVA, the Government considers that, since the necessary legal steps were not taken, the case is devoid of the elements necessary for its continued examination.
.The Committee takes note of this information from the Government, but emphasizes that it contradicts its earlier information according to which the appeal lodged by the SRTVA was ruled to be admissible by the Supreme Court on  May  (see th Report, para. ). The Committee regrets that the Government has not acted on its recommendations in which it requested an investigation into the alleged presence of representatives of the company CORAVEN-RCTV at the constituent meeting of the trade union SINATRAINCORACTEL and the alleged threats to dismiss workers who refused to join the new union. The Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, by ratifying Convention No. , the Government undertook to respect the principle that organizations of workers and employers must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference from one another, be it direct or through its agents or members, in their establishment, operations or administration. The Committee hopes that in future the Government will ensure that cases of interference and discrimination will be dealt with severely and that appropriate legal sanctions will be applied.
.The Committee examined this case at its meetings in March , July  and March  and submitted the following interim reports to the Governing Body (see nd Report, paras.  to ; th Report, paras.  to ; and th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ), th Session (June ) and st Session (March )).
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  November .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the Government in its reply neither confirms nor denies the presence of representatives of the company CORAVEN-RCTV at the constituent meeting of the new trade union SINATRAINCORACTEL, nor does it confirm or deny the alleged threat to dismiss workers who did not join the new union. Instead, it confines itself to stating that there are mechanisms and remedies available to the other union (SRTVA). The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into these allegations and to keep it informed as soon as possible of the outcome thereof.
.Taking into account the foregoing considerations, and given that the Government in its successive replies has maintained that the present case concerns an internal dispute in a trade union which gave rise to the establishment of another union with a membership of  workers, the Committee considers it necessary to have the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice on this matter. It requests the Government to send it the text of the decision handed down in this regard.
.In view of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation on the allegations concerning the presence of representatives of the company CORAVEN-RCTV at the constituent meeting of the new trade union SINATRAINCORACTEL, and the alleged threat to dismiss workers who did not join the new union, and to keep it informed as soon as possible of the outcome thereof.(b) Considering it necessary to have the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice on the matter that has given rise to the present complaint, the Committee requests the Government to send it a text of this ruling.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  and July  meetings and presented interim reports to the Governing Body (see nd Report, paras.  to , and th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ) and its th Session (June )).
.The Government sent further observations in communications dated  May  and  January .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective
.In the previous examination of the case carried out in June  (see th Report, paras.  to ) the allegations remained pending that the management of the CORAVEN-RCTV broadcasting company had encouraged the establishment of a new trade union (SINATRAINCORATEL) -- approved very quickly by the authorities in  days -- by means of a number of anti-union activities (presence of representatives of the enterprise at the constituent meeting of the new trade union, threats of dismissal against workers who did not join the new union, negotiation of a collective agreement with the trade union when an earlier agreement was still in force -- the complainant organization says that the previous collective agreement was unilaterally cancelled by the enterprise -- etc.) and that the administrative authorities committed certain irregularities in the registration of the new trade union (there was no constituent meeting as such and members of the management belonged to the former union). The already existing trade union (Occupational Trade Union of Radio, Theatre, Cinema, Television and Allied Workers of the Federal District and State of Miranda -- SRTVA) lodged various appeals against the acts mentioned.
.In its communication of  May  the Government stated that the Ministry of Labour rejected two appeals from the SRTVA to have the registration of SINATRAINCORATEL cancelled and that it could institute legal proceedings within a period of six months after the last decision ( January ). The Government indicates that it is not competent to cancel the registration of an organization since it would amount to a dissolution by administrative authority, which is in violation of Convention No. . Since SINATRAINCORATEL was created with employer interference, the parties concerned should appeal to the competent judicial organ.
.The Committee asked the Government to indicate whether the SRTVA has instituted legal proceedings concerning the allegations of interference by the management of CORAVEN-RCTV in the creation as well as in the activities of the union SINATRAINCORATEL and, if this is the case, to inform it of the decision in question. The Committee also highlighted the extremely long period of time (from March  to January ) taken by the Ministry of Labour to rule on SRTVA's appeal to have the registration of the new trade union (SINATRAINCORATEL), created with the interference of the employer, cancelled, and hopes that the judicial authority will be able to deliver a decision shortly.
.In its communications of  May  and  January  the Government sent a copy of the various appeals by SRTVA since February  to the administrative authorities to have the registration of SINATRAINCORATEL cancelled, which were rejected, and indicates that the Ministry of Labour is not competent to cancel the registration of a union organization such as SINATRAINCORATEL, as requested by the complainant, as this would amount to a dissolution by administrative authority of a union organization which is in violation of Convention No.  and national legislation.
.The Government adds that on  July  the Occupational Trade Union of Radio, Theatre, Cinema, Television and Allied Workers of the Federal District and State of Miranda (SRTVA) instituted legal proceedings before the Supreme Court with an appeal for protection of its constitutional rights, as well as an appeal for annulment for reasons of unconstitutionality of the Administrative Act passed by the Directorate of the National Labour Inspection Services and Collective Labour Affairs of the Ministry of Labour on  January  under which the National Union of Workers in the Radio and Television Industry CORAVEN-RCTV (SINATRAINCORATEL) is registered. The political and administrative chamber of the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on this",1,1994,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
301,"matter. The Government, however, emphasizes that the Supreme Court is not competent in this matter and that those involved should have appealed to the jurisdiction of the administrative court.
.The Government states that it cannot be claimed that the registration of SINATRAINCORATEL is contestable. In this case the dispute arises among members of the same union organization which is involved in its own break-up and subsequent creation of a parallel union, which is legally permitted within the precepts of freedom of association. To deny this would indeed constitute interference in exercising this right by those very workers who refused to accept the existence of another union in their sphere of labour. In this respect, the National Constitution lays down generically that unions, whether they be workers' or employers' unions, will only be subjected to the requirements that the law establishes for their existence and functioning. Only the legislator is capable of establishing the requisites for the constitution and functioning of union organizations and legislation is limited to establishing formal requisites that union organizations and the administration in charge of this subject must follow. In this respect it is not true that registration of the union took place outside the legal framework, as is evident in the report since the union organization fulfilled all legal requisites for its constitution according to the criteria of the Directorate of the National Labour Inspection Services and Collective Labour Affairs, whereby it was registered. According to the decision on an administrative appeal, the constituent meeting took place on  December  and a meeting to elect a management committee took place on  December  and was attended by  workers. Although this took place in premises belonging to the employers this does not mean that people were not acting of their own free will in forming a union.
.The Government explains that the constitution of a number of unions in the same sphere of labour activity often attests to freedom in carrying out union activity and demonstrates the principle of union pluralism, which implies a legal prohibition against any interference in such exercise, establishing that not only the employer and the State are susceptible to involvement in conduct which might infringe this right but that, more frequently than one might think, it is the workers' union organizations themselves that become involved in such anti-union behaviour as just described.
.As regards the ""complacency"" which the complainants allege was committed by the Directorate of the National Labour Inspection Services and Collective Labour Affairs in registering the union in ""record time"", the Government indicates that registration took place within the  days stipulated by the Organic Labour Act (section ). This administrative diligence cannot be considered against the law as other unions were registered in the same legal time-limit.
.As regards the fact that several of those people promoting the new union were part of the enterprise committee for the complainant, and according to its statutes were not able to form another union, it should be stated that the complainant should report them to the disciplinary tribunal and sanction them according to their statutes as this is an internal problem for the union itself and not one falling within the purview of the administrative office.
.As regards the argument concerning the negotiation of a collective agreement for the new union, the authority that resolved the first administrative appeal indicates, with reference to the existence of collective provisions in force, that it is up to the Directorate of the National Labour Inspection Services to ensure that the principle of intangibility of the collective agreement be maintained. The Government indicates that, while it is correct that documentation for the new union omitted the address of affiliated workers, it did state that this was not serious and was easily corrected or able to be validated.
.The Committee observes that this complaint concerns the registration of a union (SINATRAINCORATEL) -- approved very quickly by the authorities in spite of various anomalies -- which took place even though there already was a union in the radio and television enterprise CORAVEN-RCTV (this union was the SRTVA); and that the enterprise supported the constitution of a new union through various anti-union activities (presence of representatives of the enterprise at the constituent meeting of the new trade union, threats of dismissal against workers who did not join a new union, negotiation of a collective agreement with the new trade union when an earlier agreement was still in force, etc.). According to the complainant there was no constituent meeting as such and members of the executive belonged to the former union.
.The Committee notes that the Government declares that: () once the new union was established a further meeting --  days later -- was held to elect the executive committee and  workers attended this meeting; () in this case, freedom of association gave rise to a parallel union which is constitutionally acceptable in legislation; () the new union fulfilled all legal criteria; () the new union was not registered in record time but rather within the time-limit laid down by legislation; () the fact that the new union had leaders from the union committee already in existence is irrelevant; () as regards the existence of collective conditions already in force, it is the responsibility of the Directorate of the National Labour Inspection Services to oversee the principle of intangibility of collective agreements; () this situation concerns a dispute among members of a union which gave rise to the establishment of a new union.
.The Committee notes that the Government's declarations and the allegations are contradictory with regard to the legality of the registration of the new union. The Committee notes also that the Government's reply does not deal with the alleged presence of representatives of the enterprise at the constituent meeting for the new union, neither does it deal with the alleged threat of dismissal against workers who did not join the new union. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to send its comments concerning these allegations so that it may examine this complaint in full knowledge of the facts.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see nd Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations, and notes that it is not clear whether the union SRTVA has submitted an appeal to the judicial authority or not. In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the SRTVA has instituted legal proceedings concerning the allegations of interference by the management of CORAVEN-RCTV in the creation as well as in the activities of the union SINATRAINCORATEL and, if this is the case, to inform it of the decision in question.
.Just as in its previous examination of the case, the Committee once again highlights the extremely long period of time (from March  to January ) taken by the Ministry of Labour to rule on SRTVA's appeal to have the registration of the new trade union (SINATRAINCORATEL), created with the interference of the employer, cancelled, and hopes that the judicial authority will be able to deliver a decision shortly.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:- The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the union SRTVA has instituted legal proceedings concerning the alleged interference of the management of CORAVEN-RCTV in the establishment and functioning of SINATRAINCORATEL and, if this is the case, to inform it of the decision in question.
.This complaint is contained in a communication from the International Secretariat of Arts, Communications and Maintenance Trade Unions/International Federation of Audiovisual Workers (ISETU/FISTAV) dated  October . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  December  and  February .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October  the ISETU/FISTAV states that the CORAVEN Broadcasting Company has some , employees throughout the country and that since the founding of Radio Caracas in  the recognized trade union has been the Occupational Trade Union of Radio, Theatre, Cinema, Television and Allied Workers of the Federal District and State of Miranda (SRTVA). The complainant organization adds that SRTVA has about , members,  of whom work for CORAVEN, that SRTVA had a collective agreement with CORAVEN up to  June , and that elections were held in October .
.The complainant organization states that in January , to the trade union's great surprise, the management of CORAVEN and the Ministry of Labour announced that a new trade union under the name of National Union of Workers",1,1994,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
302,"in the Radio and Television Industry (SINATRAINCORATEL) had been recognized. Despite its name, which would suggest that it covers all workers in the sector throughout the country, this trade union only claims representation in the CORAVEN company. The management added that they had negotiated and signed a collective agreement with the new union in record time, some of whose terms were in some respects less advantageous for the workers than those of the earlier agreement. The complainant organization also mentions that the leaders of the new union used to be members of SRTVA or, more exactly, of a faction that lost the October  elections.
.The complainant organization alleges that no proper workers' meeting was ever held as the regulations for establishing a trade union require, but that, without explaining why, a kind of staff meeting was called which was attended by  workers and representatives of the enterprise who were then told that if they did not join the new union they might lose their jobs. The complainant organization states that about  workers signed the proposal to establish a new union.
.The complainant organization alleges that the creation of the new union SINATRAINCORATEL, and its rapid approval by the Ministry of Labour are in violation of the ILO's Conventions on freedom of association and of a number of national laws. It draws attention to the following anomalies in the approval procedure followed by the Ministry of Labour: the Ministry did not investigate charges that the workers had been intimidated by the management in order to force them to support the new officers of the trade union; several of the formal requirements of the request for approval were not observed (headquarters and purpose of the new trade union), nor were the necessary by-laws submitted until after approval had been given; the Ministry officials failed to point out that all the officers of the new trade union were also registered as members of the existing union, which is not allowed under Venezuelan law; and the extensive period of time normally needed by the Ministry was disregarded in this case and approval granted within a mere two weeks.
.The complainant organization points out that the new collective agreement was approved not only much more quickly than usual but completely contrary to normal procedure. It says that it is not clear who negotiated the second agreement but that the law prohibits an employer from negotiating a new agreement so long as an earlier agreement is in force and provides that, if this provision is infringed, only negotiated conditions that are more favourable for the employee may enter into force - which was not what happened this time since the employer opted to recognize the less-favourable new convention. The complainant organization further points out that the law stipulates that, if an employer unilaterally cancels an agreement, the Ministry of Labour must oblige him or her to pay the workers' compensation up to the value of the losses they incur over the remaining period during which the agreement would have been in force; this too was not done in this case.
.Finally, the complainant organization states that, in the light of the foregoing, SRTVA requested the Ministry of Labour to cancel its recognition of the parallel trade union organization and of the collective agreement it had negotiated, but that on  February  the Ministry issued a communiqu asserting that it found nothing illegal in the way the new trade union and the negotiated agreement had been recognized. SRTVA and the National Federation of Radio, Theatre, Cinema and Television Workers (FEDERATEL) have lodged an appeal with the judicial authorities and the case is currently before the Supreme Court.
.In its communication of  December  the Government states that the allegations of the complainant organization concern a dispute between CORAVEN-RCTV and its workers, in which the Ministry of Labour has been required to arbitrate. The dispute arose during the period of office of the government that preceded that which took office in February . Moreover, the legal proceedings that have been initiated against the enterprise, on the grounds that it encouraged the creation of a parallel trade union, are still under way, since the appeal is before the Higher Labour Tribunal which has not yet handed down its judgement. Finally, the Government says that the new authorities within the Ministry of Labour, whose officials guarantee full compliance with the laws and regulations in force, must be given time to act.
.In its communication of  February  the Government states that on  January  the Directorate of the National Labour Inspection Services and Collective Labour Affairs of the Ministry of Labour officially registered SINATRAINCORATEL, and that on  February  SRTVA lodged an appeal with the Directorate to reconsider this administrative decision. The Directorate ruled on  February  that the appeal was inadmissible. On  March  SRTVA appealed to a higher authority to have the  February administrative decision declared null and void. This further appeal was declared inadmissible by the Office of the Ministry of Labour on  January . Finally, the Government observes that SRTVA has six months to lodge an appeal against this decision with the Political and Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges that the management of CORAVEN-RCTV encouraged the establishment of a new trade union by means of a number of anti-union activities (presence of representatives of the enterprise at the constituent meeting of the new trade union, threats of dismissal against workers who did not join the new union, negotiation of a collective agreement with the new trade union when an earlier agreement was still in force, etc.) and that the administrative authorities committed certain irregularities in the registration of the new trade union.
.The Committee notes that, in response to these allegations, the Government states: () that they concern a dispute between CORAVEN-RCTV and its workers in which the Ministry of Labour is acting as arbitrator, and that the dispute arose during the term of office of the previous government; () that the legal proceedings against the enterprise are still under way because the appeal is before the Higher Labour Tribunal which has not yet handed down its judgement; () that on  January  the Directorate of the National Labour Inspection Services and Collective Labour Affairs of the Ministry of Labour officially registered SINATRAINCORATEL; () that SRTVA appealed to the Directorate to reconsider its decision to register the new trade union and that the appeal was declared inadmissible on  February ; () that SRTVA lodged an appeal with a higher authority on  March  requesting that the administrative decision rejecting its appeal be declared null and void; () that on  January  the Office of the Ministry of Labour ruled that this second appeal was inadmissible; and () that SRTVA has six months to lodge an appeal against this decision with the Political and Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice within six months.
.The Committee understands that the appeal lodged by SRTVA with the Higher Labour Tribunal is directed against the employer for interfering in the establishment of the new trade union. Parallel with this appeal, SRTVA appealed to the administrative authorities to have the registration of the new trade union cancelled. This administrative appeal was rejected and the trade union can now lodge an appeal against this decision with the Political and Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice.
.In the first place, the Committee observes with concern the extremely long period of time that the Ministry of Labour authorities have taken to rule on SRTVA's appeal to have the registration of the new trade union cancelled (from March  to January ). On this point, the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that administrative or court proceedings relating to matters of employer interference in violation of Convention No.  should be examined quickly, and that an excessive delay in processing such cases is tantamount to a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned. Moreover, the Committee observes that the Government merely lists the various appeals that have been lodged by SRTVA without providing the text of or reasons for the corresponding administrative rulings, and without denying the alleged anti-union interference by the management of the enterprise in the establishment of the new trade union.
.In these circumstances, while observing that an appeal has been lodged with the Higher Labour Tribunal by SRTVA concerning the alleged interference by the management of CORAVEN-RCTV, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial proceedings and to send it the text of the judgement handed down and of the previous administrative decisions that the Government refers to in its reply.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the outcome of the appeal lodged",1,1994,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) criticized a bill on safeguarding the exercise of democratic procedures within trade unions and workers' federations and confederations, pointing out that, if this bill were passed, it would seriously interfere with the internal functioning of trade unions, in violation of Article  of Convention No. . Specifically, the complainant organization objects to the following provisions of the bill:- section , which requires a direct vote of trade unionists in elections at every level, including the level of the confederation;- section , which requires that the composition of electoral committees be pluralistic so that all candidates or groups of candidates are represented on them. Vast powers are also granted to labour courts in order to maintain a balanced and fair electoral process;- sections  and , which limit federation and confederation officials to a three-year term of office while prohibiting officials from being re-elected more than once to the same position and from serving on an executive committee for more than ten years;- section , which requires that trade unions submit decisions for approval by its members concerning provisional collective agreements, the termination of collective agreements and declarations of labour disputes, or their settlement, including at the level of the confederation. Furthermore, this article allows a court to convene a general assembly upon request from at least  per cent of the members of a trade union in order to vote on ending the term of office of an executive committee;- sections  and , which require the electoral system applicable to trade unions, federations and confederations to utilize an open-slate system with proportional representation of minorities;- section , whereby any provisions of trade union regulations or statutes that contradict the provisions of the bill will be inapplicable;- section , whereby all trade union officials who have not been elected by universal, direct and secret vote will be discharged from their positions, with new elections required within six months;- section , whereby trade unions may not withdraw anyone's voting right for having failed to pay union dues.
.In its communications of  and  January , the Government states that the bill criticized by the complainant organization was examined by legal advisors at the Ministry of Labour, which rules that it appears that this bill might violate trade unions' right to organize freely and to formulate their programmes of action as recognized by Convention No. . Specifically, the ruling by the legal advisors criticized various provisions of the bill, with the following observations:- section  - which requires that trade union elections be held under conditions of universal, direct and secret vote of trade unionists, including those who, because of their trade union affiliation, belong to federations and confederations - regulates matters that should be left solely to the discretion of trade unions;- section  - which states that trade union executive committees cannot intervene in collective bargaining and labour disputes - violates the aforementioned freedom of trade unions to draw up their own rules and could seriously impair freedom of association;- section  - which requires that elections of federation or confederation executive committees be held at least every three years - violates trade unions' freedom to draw up their own rules;- section  - which states that no member of a trade union executive committee can be re-elected more than once for the same position nor serve on the executive committee for more than ten years - violates the provisions of Convention No. ;- section  - which submits certain trade union activities, namely collective bargaining and disputes, to a compulsory referendum - could prove highly inconvenient, e.g. for workers who are widely dispersed;- sections  to  - which regulate the convening of trade union elections - permit extensive intervention by the judiciary in the electoral process;- section  - which requires trade unions to utilize an open-slate system with proportional representation of minorities for the election of their officials - violates trade union independence inasmuch as trade unions themselves should be allowed to decide on the system best suited to their interests;- section  - whereby statutes of trade unions, federations and confederations that contradict the law are repealed - is an infringement of trade unions' freedom to draw up their own rules;- section  - whereby all trade union executive committee members who have not been elected by universal, direct and secret vote of workers are to be discharged from their position - ignores the principle that laws are not retroactive and violates the right of trade unions to elect officials as they see fit;- section  - whereby no one may be denied the right to vote by reason of having failed to pay trade union dues - violates the right of trade unions to enact their own statutes freely.
.Lastly, the Government adds that the Ministry of Labour has submitted its observations on the bill to the Congress of the Republic and that it will communicate all information in this respect in due course.
.The Committee notes that the allegations presented in this case concern a bill before the National Congress relative to the protection of the right of trade unions, workers' federations and confederations to exercise internal democratic procedures. Specifically, the complainant organization criticizes numerous provisions of the bill as regards the method of electing trade union officials, limiting the tenure of trade union positions, prohibiting re-election, discharging trade union leaders from their positions, and so forth.
.When the Committee has had to deal with precise and detailed allegations regarding draft legislation, it has taken the view that the fact that such allegations relate to a text that does not have the force of law should not in itself prevent the Committee from expressing its opinion on the merits of the allegations made. The Committee has considered it desirable that, in such cases, the Government and the complainant should be made aware of the Committee's point of view with regard to the proposed bill before it is enacted, since it is open to the Government, on whose initiative such a matter depends, to make any amendments thereto (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.In this case the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that the Ministry of Labour has examined the bill in question and ruled that it ""appears that this bill might violate trade unions' right to exercise freely the right to organize and to formulate their programmes of action"". The ruling has been communicated to the Congress of the Republic. The Committee agrees with the Ministry's ruling. The Committee notes that, from the allegations of the complainant organization and the Government's reply, it may be deduced that many provisions of the bill in question clearly violate the right of workers' organizations to elect their representatives freely, and to organize their administration and activities. In these circumstances, the Committee suggests that the Government take the necessary measures to withdraw the bill which contains certain provisions not in conformity with freedom of association and which is now before the Congress of the Republic.
.If the Government considers it necessary to submit a new bill, the Committee invites it to ensure that the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and  be fully respected, in particular the principle whereby ""the regulation of procedures and methods for the election of trade union officials is primarily to be governed by the trade unions' rules themselves"". The fundamental idea of Article  of Convention No.  is that ""workers and employers may decide for themselves the rules which should govern the administration of their organizations and the elections which are held therein"" (see th Report, Case No.  (Uruguay), para. ). Lastly, the Committee recommends that the Government consult representative organizations. The Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the Office is at its disposal if desired.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee suggests that the Government take the necessary measures to withdraw the bill relative to the protection of internal democratic procedures within trade unions, federations and confederations, which contains certain provisions not in conformity with freedom of association.(b) If the Government decides to submit a new bill to Congress, the Committee invites it to ensure that all the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and  be fully respected, and that the Government consult representative organizations.(c) The Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the Office is at its disposal if desired.",0,1994,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) alleges that Mr. Felipe Muoz Key, a worker of the Vargas Hospital and member of the Hospitals and Clinics Trade Union of the Federal District and State of Miranda, of the National Federation of Health Workers (FETRASALUD) and of the United Federation of Workers of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (FUT), was murdered on  August . The complainant organization adds that Mr. Muoz Key's son was injured and a policeman died on the same occasion.
.The complainant organization states that Mr. Muoz Key received threats in the days prior to his murder and had even been abducted for  hours. Finally, the complainant organization points out that Mr. Muoz Key had reported irregularities which took place at the Vargas Hospital and that on the day of his murder his name appeared on a list of candidates which obtained the highest number of votes in trade union elections.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that a judicial investigation is under way to ascertain the reasons behind the murder of Mr. Felipe Muoz Key and to determine who is responsible, but that since this case is now in the indictment phase it is not possible to provide any specific information concerning the investigation. Furthermore, the Government reports that after requesting information from the National Federation of Health Workers (FETRASALUD) and the United Federation of Workers of the Federal District and State of Miranda (FUT), it was possible to determine that Mr. Muoz Key was a kitchen worker at the Vargas Hospital of Caracas, that he was not an enterprise trade union delegate and that the list in which he was presented for the trade union elections did not obtain the highest number of votes in trade union elections (it adds that Mr. Muoz Key was the second candidate on the list). Furthermore, the trade union organizations reported that they were not aware of threats made against Mr. Muoz Key or of his subsequent abduction.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the person suspected of murdering Mr. Muoz Key has been arrested. The judicial investigation is continuing in the indictment phase. According to the Government, the murder was carried out by the mob and not as described by the complainant organization.
.The Committee profoundly regrets the murder of Mr. Muoz Key, a trade unionist and member of the Hospitals and Clinics Trade Union of the Federal District and State of Miranda, and the death of a policeman, as well as the injuries sustained by the son of Mr. Muoz Key. The Committee notes that according to the Government a judicial investigation is under way to determine the reasons for the murder of Mr. Muoz Key and that the person suspected of this murder has been arrested. Moreover, the Committee notes that Mr. Muoz Key was not a trade union delegate, although he was a candidate in trade union elections which he did not win. The Committee trusts that the investigation will be concluded without delay so as to establish the facts, determine who is responsible and severely punish the guilty parties. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures in this regard and to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial investigation under way and to ensure that the investigation also covers the injuries sustained by Mr. Muoz Key's son.
.The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that a climate of violence aimed at trade union leaders and their families does not encourage the free exercise of the trade union rights set out in Conventions Nos.  and , and that all States have the duty to guarantee their respect. The Committee urges the Government to take all measures in its power to ensure respect for this principle.

306,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the Union of Workers in the Textile, Clothing and Allied Industries of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (UTIT) dated  November . The complainant organization subsequently presented additional information and new allegations in communications dated  December  and  June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  August  and  November .
.Venezuela has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the Union of Workers in the Textile, Clothing and Allied Industries of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (UTIT) states that in September ,  workers in the textile enterprises Inversiones Montseny and Confecciones Vertier, which belong to the HRH group, voluntarily disaffiliated from the trade union organization of which they were members and joined the UTIT. The complainant organization adds that, in view of the conditions in which the workers had to work, the UTIT presented a list of grievances to the labour inspectorate on  September  demanding that the employers comply with the collective agreement in force for the textile sector. The complainant organization states that the labour inspectorate and the enterprises in question attempted to ignore the workers' wish to organize and that trade union officials were denied access for three days. The refusal of access was later followed by the dismissal of eight trade union officers. In the absence of a reply to their list of grievances the workers in the enterprises declared a strike on  September . On  and  September  the labour inspectorate declared the strike illegal and the list of grievances inadmissible. Lastly, the complainant organization alleges that on  October  more than  workers were dismissed and that a mediation board was set up with a view to attempting conciliation.
.In its communication dated  December , the UTIT states that in November  the enterprises Inversiones Montseny and Confecciones Vertier applied for a court eviction of the striking workers who had occupied the premises and the vicinity of the enterprises on the grounds that they had infringed, inter alia, the right to honour and reputation, the right to free movement and the right to work, etc. The complainant organization adds that as a result of the court decision, the police violently evicted the workers, causing injuries to  of them. The UTIT states further that the same court that ordered the eviction accepted the deposit of the compensation due to the  workers involved in the dispute. The complainant organization also states that the court upheld an appeal for relief presented by the complainant organization and declared null and void the decision of the labour inspectorate declaring the strike illegal and the list of grievances inadmissible, and established that the workers had the right to continue the grievance and conciliation procedure since the labour inspectorate had acted outside its sphere of competence.
.In its communication dated  June , the complainant organization states that under the court decision upholding its appeal for relief it requested the Ministry of Labour to order the reinstatement of the workers dismissed and the referral of the dispute to compulsory arbitration provided for in the legislation, and that despite the fact that the strike was suspended and the grievances withdrawn, the enterprises did not agree to reinstate the workers who had been dismissed.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that the labour relations of the enterprises involved in this case, which belong to the HRH group, are governed by a collective agreement for the branch of industrial activity and that their employees are affiliated to the Trade Union of Clothing, Thread and Textile Industries of the Federal District and the State of Miranda. The Government adds that in September  the labour inspectorate with jurisdiction over eastern Caracas received a list of grievances pertaining to a dispute against the HRH enterprise by a union other than that party to the collective agreement and that none of the  points raised referred to failure to comply with the collective agreement in force, but that they dealt with a wage increase, leave and profits, which may be bargaining topics only once the collective agreement has expired. The Government states that this request should not be made by means of a collective dispute, since under the Organic Labour Act, the latter serves to obtain compliance with the collective agreements in force or working conditions which the employer fails to observe.
.The Government points out that once dispute grievances have been submitted, the workers cannot be dismissed until the labour inspector rules on the admissibility of the grievances but that the workers nevertheless declared a strike before a ruling had been made by the inspector and before the procedural time period for dispute grievance procedures had elapsed, refusing to carry out their usual work. This dispute was the reason for the presence of the fourth municipal judge of Sucre and of the labour inspectors, who noted that approximately  workers were on strike, refusing to work until the enterprise reinstated eight workers who had been dismissed (these eight workers refused to request the labour inspectorate to begin the procedure to establish the nature of the dismissal, which is the remedy available to workers entitled to trade union immunity when their dismissal is considered to be wrongful).
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that on  November  the enterprises Inversiones Montseny and Confecciones Vertier of the HRH group made an ""offer of payment"" before the judicial authorities, depositing the compensation and statutory social benefits of the workers who had been dismissed () and that on  March  they had requested an extension of the offer of payment, depositing the compensation of eight more workers. The Government adds that these eight workers, who were trade union officers, had been dismissed in September  and that they had not petitioned the labour inspectorate for reinstatement within the statutory time-limit and that as a result their compensation had been deposited with the court. Lastly, the Government points out that in July  the workers involved in the dispute accepted the compensation deposited with the judicial authorities by the enterprises (the Government appended a copy of the document to this effect to its reply) and that according to national case-law, the employment relationship between the contracting parties comes to an end at the time at which the workers' legal representative declares itself informed of the genuine offer of payment and acknowledges receipt of the full amount of the workers' benefits.
.The Committee observes that the allegations presented in this case refer: () to refusal of access to the premises of the enterprises Inversiones Montseny and Confecciones Vertier of the HRH group to the officers of the complainant organization; () to the subsequent dismissal of eight of them as a result of their having submitted a list of grievances at a time when the union that had signed the collective agreement in force had lost over  members in a mass disaffiliation when they joined another organization (the complainant organization); () to the subsequent dismissal of a large number of workers (over ) in the same sector, following a strike in protest against the dismissal of eight trade union officers and the failure of the administrative authority to take a decision on the list of grievances submitted; () to the assaults by the police forces on the striking workers, as a result of which  workers were injured; () the non-reinstatement of the striking workers; and () the violation of collective bargaining.
.As regards the dismissal of the trade union officers and a large number of workers, the Committee observes that the complainant organization states that: () the denial of access to the premises of the enterprise and the subsequent dismissal of the eight trade union officers occurred after a list of grievances against the enterprises in question had been submitted to the labour inspectorate, while the trade union that had signed the collective agreement had lost  of its members in a mass disaffiliation, when they joined another organization (the complainant organization); () in the absence of a reply to their list of grievances the workers had declared a strike; () the labour inspectorate had declared the list of grievances inadmissible and the strike illegal; () the enterprises had dismissed over  workers; () the judiciary had upheld an appeal for relief filed by the complainant organization and had declared null and void the labour inspectorate's decision declaring the strike illegal and the list of grievances inadmissible, on grounds that they had no competence to do so, establishing that the workers had the right to continue the grievance and conciliation procedure; () pursuant to the court decision, the trade union had requested the Ministry of Labour to order the reinstatement of the",0,1992,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
307,"workers and referral of the dispute to the compulsory arbitration provided for by law; and () despite the fact that the workers had withdrawn the list of grievances they had submitted and suspended the strike and returned to work, the enterprises in question had not agreed to reinstate the workers who had been dismissed.
.Moreover, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () a trade union other than that which concluded the collective agreement in force and of which most of the workers of the enterprises in question were members had submitted a list of grievances to the labour inspectorate in an incorrect manner, since there already was a collective agreement in force and the grievances did not refer to failure to comply with it (the only subject of grievances in a dispute), but to various matters - in particular, wage issues - which can be topics for new bargaining only once the collective agreement in force has expired; moreover, according to the Government, the workers had declared a strike without adhering to the statutory time periods, since they did so before the labour inspectorate had ruled on the admissibility of the list of grievances; () the trade union officers dismissed had not filed a petition with the labour inspectorate for reinstatement, as provided by law for workers entitled to trade union immunity; () the enterprises Inversiones Montseny and Confecciones Vertier of the HRH group had deposited the compensation of  workers and the eight trade union officers who had been dismissed, all of whom had accepted their dismissal compensation.
.Firstly, the Committee would point out that it is clear from the information and documents provided in this case that the issue is a complicated one which encompasses various court and administrative decisions, and it is therefore necessary to analyse the allegations relating to the dismissals separately.
.As regards the denial of access to the premises of the enterprises in question to trade union officers of the complainant organization because a list of dispute grievances had been presented, the Committee emphasizes that this is a serious violation of the right of organizations to carry out their activities freely, which includes the presentation of grievances even by a trade union other than that which concluded the collective agreement in force, all the more so because in this case the trade union which had signed the agreement had lost members in a mass disaffiliation of workers who had decided to join the complainant organization. In this respect, the Committee emphasizes the importance of respecting the consequences of the workers' right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing (Article  of Convention No. ).
.As regards the dismissal of the eight trade union officers, the Committee notes that they were dismissed following the submission of a list of dispute grievances and that the Government does not deny that such dismissals took place. In this respect, the Committee considers that in no case should it be possible to dismiss a trade union officer merely for having presented a list of dispute grievances and that this constitutes an extremely serious act of discrimination. The Committee therefore deeply deplores these anti-union dismissals and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the dismissal of trade unionists for carrying out legitimate trade union activities violates the principle of freedom association. However, the Committee observes that in this case the trade union officers affected did not request reinstatement from the administrative or judicial authorities and that, according to the Government, they accepted the compensation that had been deposited with the court. In addition, since, according to the Government, the workers' acceptance of payment of compensation marks the end of the dispute and terminates the employment relationship, the Committee understands that it is not possible to request the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union officers. In this respect, the Committee recalls the principle according to which it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, as set out in Convention No. , is accorded by legislation which enables employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination so that it will not be possible to dismiss a trade union officer for carrying out legitimate trade union activities, such as the mere fact of having presented a list of dispute grievances. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the dismissed trade union leaders and members were able to opt individually for reinstatement in their posts.
.As regards the dismissal of more than  workers, although according to the Government the complainant organization did not comply with the applicable legal requirements to declare a strike (a strike was declared without adhering to the statutory time periods as the labour inspectorate was still examining the admissibility of the list of dispute grievances submitted and a collective agreement was still in force), the Committee cannot but observe that these dismissals took place following a strike in protest not only against the absence of a reply to the list of dispute grievances but also against the unlawful dismissal of the eight trade union officers referred to in the previous paragraph. The Committee also observes that the judicial authority had declared null and void the administrative decisions declaring the strike illegal and the list of grievances inadmissible, on the grounds that the labour inspectorate had acted outside its sphere of competence, and had ordered the grievance and conciliation procedure to be continued. In these circumstances, the Committee cannot but deplore the dismissal of these  workers for trade union reasons. Therefore, while the Committee notes that all the workers dismissed accepted the dismissal compensation deposited with the court in July , thus putting an end to the dispute that had began in , it would point out that ""dismissals of strikers on a large scale involve a serious risk of abuse, and place freedom of association in grave jeopardy; the competent authorities should be given appropriate instructions so as to obviate the dangers to freedom of association that such ... dismissals involve"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect of this principle.
.The Committee refers the question of whether the authority granted to the labour inspector by the Organic Labour Act to decide on the admissibility of grievances is in conformity with Article  of the Labour Inspection Convention (No. ) to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.As regards the allegation concerning physical assaults by the police forces on the striking workers of the enterprises Inversiones Montseny and Confecciones Vertier of the HRH group in November  (as a result of which  workers were injured), the Committee observes that the complainant acknowledges that the eviction was carried out under a court order issued after a petition by the enterprises which stated that the striking workers had infringed, inter alia, the right to honour and reputation, the right to freedom of movement, the right to work, etc. The Committee also observes that the Government has not referred specifically to the alleged acts of violence. In these circumstances, the Committee deplores these acts of violence and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to carry out a judicial inquiry in order to ascertain the facts and determine responsibilities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Recalling that the dismissal of workers for their trade union membership or activities violates the principles of freedom of association, the Committee deeply deplores the anti-union dismissals of the trade union officers and members of the Union of Workers in the Textile, Clothing and Allied Industries of the Federal District and the State of Miranda (UTIT) and requests the Government to take measures to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and to indicate whether the dismissed trade union leaders and members were able to opt individually for reinstatement in their posts.(b) The Committee refers the question of whether the authority granted to the labour inspector by the Organic Labour Act to decide on the admissibility of grievances is in conformity with Article  of the Labour Inspection Convention (No. ) to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.(c) With respect to the physical assaults on the striking workers of the enterprises Inversiones Montseny and Confecciones Vertier of the HRH group in November , the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to carry out a judicial inquiry in order to ascertain the facts and determine responsibilities. The Committee requests the",1,1992,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
308,Government to keep it informed in this respect.,1,1992,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
309,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  October . Subsequently, in communications dated  November  and  April , the ICFTU provided additional information. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Venezuela has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  October and  November , the ICFTU alleges that for almost two years the Venezuelan press, with the tacit consent of the authorities, carried out a campaign to discredit and undermine the efficient operation of the most important trade union central organization in the country, the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (CTV) and that during the same period the President of the Confederation, Mr. Antonio Ros, was the victim of systematic slander and unfounded accusations of irresponsible conduct and corruption. This deliberate campaign created a general climate of hostility against Mr. Ros which was at least in part the pretext for the armed attack carried out against him on  September . The complainant points out that the Government did not provide Mr. Ros with the necessary protection even though it was aware of the death threats which he had received. It states that after recovering from the injuries which he had suffered, Mr. Ros was placed under house arrest, which prevented him from attending a session of the ILO Governing Body. He was subsequently transferred to the same detention centre in which the person who had carried out the attack against him is being held, thus putting Mr. Ros in an extremely dangerous situation.
.In its communication of  April , the ICFTU points out that the origin of the anti-trade union campaign can be traced back to the Government's liberalization and structural adjustment policy and the opposition to that policy by the CTV, which in May  organized the first general strike since the restoration of democracy in Venezuela. This campaign to discredit the CTV and its President was designed to undermine the trade union movement which had shown its capacity to mobilize workers in the defence of their interests. The complainant states that in January and March of , as a result of the anti-trade union campaign, Mr. Ros was brought before the courts on the charge of having traded in his influence; in September  he was detained on this charge and following the attempt against his life was once again arrested following additional accusations made to the Superior Court for the Protection of Public Property.
.Finally, the complainant refers to irregularities and acts of discrimination in the judicial proceedings against Mr. Ros and states that he did not have the benefit of a fair and impartial trial. It specifies that in Venezuela there is political interference in the judiciary and that this is even acknowledged by those members of the judiciary who acted against Mr. Ros. The President of the Supreme Court allegedly has admitted that sometimes there are political intentions behind the trial of a high ranking personality. Moreover, the complainant points out that members of the Superior Court for the Protection of Public Property (the judicial body responsible for the trial) allegedly received anonymous death threats in case they ruled in favour of this trade union official.
.More specifically, the complainant describes the irregularities that occurred during the judicial proceedings as the following: the changes on several occasions in the charges brought (the Attorney-General, after having charged Mr. Ros with two different offences, centred his accusations on one of them, then subsequently formulated new accusations); the exceptional nature of the arbitrary detention (Mr. Ros was refused conditional release and thus had to undergo prolonged detention. The Superior Court for the Protection of Public Property ordered his arrest with a view to bringing him to trial, which should have resulted in the conditional release of Mr. Ros until the final verdict. In spite of this, the Attorney-General appealed against this decision and exceptionally, the Criminal Chamber of the Superior Court accepted the appeal and ordered that Mr. Ros remain in detention); the difference in the legal treatment of this case with respect to others (despite the extreme slowness of the judicial procedure in Venezuela, in the case of Mr. Ros, evidence presented against the accused was examined quickly whereas the examination of the evidence presented in his favour was adjourned). In the same way, the effects of the media campaign against Mr. Ros were felt. In these conditions, it was extremely difficult for the judicial bodies to examine this case impartially on the basis of its legal merits.
.As regards the attempted assassination of Mr. Ros, the Government states in its communications of  February and  July  that this attack was condemned by the government authorities and that those responsible for the attack were immediately arrested by the police. The authors of the attack described themselves as members of the Bolivarian Liberation Forces and stated that the attack was part of a ""dignity operation"" directed against persons who had carried out acts of corruption. In the same way, the Government recognizes that there has been a campaign to discredit the image of the trade union official, Mr. Ros, but adds that it did not participate in this campaign and that it suspended television programmes which encouraged the view that corrupt persons should be put to death.
.Furthermore, the Government provides in its communications detailed information on the supposed financial irregularities which, in the view of the Attorney-General of the Nation and a Congress deputy, had allegedly been carried out by Mr. Ros, President of the Corporation of Production and Service Enterprises (CTV), to the detriment of the Bank of Workers of Venezuela, the Crdit Lyonnais, the Paribas Bank and Florida Cristal.
.The Government specifies that in January  a complaint was lodged with the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic by the Special Commission of the Congress of the Republic against the trade union official, Mr. Antonio Ros, following an accusation made by a commercial finance and credit manager of the Bank of Workers of Venezuela. The Attorney-General charged Mr. Antonio Ros, also a deputy from the Congress, with having committed offences against the public interest to the detriment of the said Bank. The Attorney-General believed that the conduct of the accused constituted the offence of trading in influence and requested the lifting of his parliamentary immunity. The Government adds that in May  Mr. Ros appealed to the Supreme Court of Justice against the accusation. Furthermore, the Government adds that on  July  a deputy of the Congress, Mr. Padrn, accused Mr. Ros of not only the offence of trading in influence but also of embezzlement. As a result of the accusations, the Supreme Court ordered the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Mr. Ros with a view to bringing legal proceedings against him in the ordinary courts for the protection of public property.
.The Government points out that in September  the Superior Court for the Protection of Public Property ordered the arrest of the trade union official on the charge of having traded in his influence, but granted him provisional release. The Attorney-General appealed against the conditional release of the accused, arguing that a suspended sentence or release on bail were not applicable in the case of offences against the public interest.
.Finally, contrary to the accusation made by the Attorney-General, the Government says that it does not believe that Mr. Ros committed the offences with which he is charged and that the accusation has been made by a prosecutor who ""sees offences everywhere"".
.The Committee observes that the complainant in this case has alleged an attempt against the life and physical integrity of Mr. Antonio Ros (President of the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela - CTV), his arrest on the charge of having committed different offences of a financial nature (a charge which the Government criticizes but which resulted in legal proceedings) and the waging of a campaign by the Venezuelan press to discredit the CTV.
.As regards the attempt against the life of Mr. Ros, the Committee deeply deplores that this trade union official was injured and expresses the firm hope that such reprehensible acts do not occur again in the future. The Committee notes with interest the Government's observations that those responsible for the attack were arrested by the police. It also notes that they themselves said that they were members of the Bolivarian Liberation Forces and that the attack was part of a ""dignity operation"" directed against persons suspected of corruption. Since the Government recognizes that there has been a campaign against the trade union official, Mr. Ros, including television programmes, although it rejects the allegation that it was implicated in this campaign, the Committee expresses the firm hope that in future any call to carry out acts of violence against trade union officials will be severely punished.

310,"specifically, as regards the judicial proceedings against Mr. Ros on a charge by the Attorney-General that he committed offences of trading in his influence and embezzlement, the Committee notes the observations of the Government that the normal judicial procedure was followed as a result of the accusations. The Committee observes, however, that this statement is in contradiction with the statement of the complainant organization according to which the judicial proceedings against Mr. Ros were exceptional and discriminatory. In this respect, the Committee draws attention to the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference on  June , which defines as rights that are fundamental to the normal exercise of trade union rights, amongst others, the rights to freedom and security of person and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention, and the right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal. The Committee also draws attention to the principle that the absence of guarantees of due process of law may lead to abuses and result in trade union officials being penalized by decisions that are groundless; it may also create a climate of insecurity and fear which may affect the exercise of trade union rights (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). Moreover, the Committee notes that the Government states that it believes that the trade union official, Mr. Antonio Ros, did not commit the offences with which he is charged. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee expresses its deep concern that proceedings should have been taken against the trade union official concerned and that he should have been charged and arrested on the basis of unfounded accusations. The Committee can only conclude that Mr. Ros was subjected to acts of anti-union discrimination.
.In these circumstances and bearing in mind the statements by the Government emphasizing the innocence of Mr. Ros as well as the arbitrary detention without trial to which Mr. Ros has been subjected, the Committee urges that Mr. Ros be released immediately pending the final outcome of the trials. In any event, the Committee regrets that Mr. Ros was not able to participate in some sessions of the ILO Governing Body and believes that, as far as possible and provided there is no obvious danger, it would be desirable, in accordance with the principle that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty, that legal proceedings against members of the ILO Governing Body should not prevent them from attending the sessions of the Governing Body.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the attempt against the life of the trade union official, Mr. Ros. It notes that the persons responsible for the attack have been arrested and are being tried. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the trial of these persons and expresses the firm hope that such reprehensible acts do not reoccur in the future.(b) The Committee urges that Mr. Ros be released immediately pending the final outcome of the trials. It requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of these trials and to send the text of the rulings to be handed down.(c) Observing that the Government is of the view that the judicial procedure followed in the present case was normal, whereas the complainant organization considers that it was exceptional and discriminatory, the Committee draws attention to the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference on  June , which defines as rights that are fundamental to the normal exercise of trade union rights, amongst others, the rights to freedom and security of person and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention, and the right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal.",1,1992,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
311,".The complaint which is the subject of the present case is contained in a communication from the Venezuelan Federation of Professional Airline Pilots' Trade Unions (FESPAVEN) dated  October . Subsequently, in a communication dated  November , FESPAVEN provided additional information. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  October and  November , the complainant organization alleges that the Government has drawn up a draft regulatory decree concerning the right to strike. According to the complainant, contrary to section  of the Labour Code in force (which allows for the exercise of the right to strike without first having recourse to legal proceedings and without the interference of a labour inspector), the decree would grant the labour inspector the authority to accept or reject the list of demands or grievances making legal recourse more of a possibility, which would virtually eliminate the right to strike.
.Similarly, the complainant organization criticizes the following provisions of the draft decree: the ban on the right to strike for workers employed throughout the health services, and those working in the telephone, electricity and water companies, in transport, street cleaning, the underground railway, in the food and fuel industries, and for air traffic controllers; the powers bestowed on the labour inspector which are not provided for by law, such as verifying and deciding on the exercise of the right to strike, and deciding that work should not be interrupted without a list of workers needed to ensure the continuity of the service having been drawn up by the parties; the labour inspector's authority to appoint members of the conciliation board when any of the parties has not appointed a representative.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government says that the draft regulation mentioned in the complaint has not yet been promulgated by the Executive, as agreement had not been reached in the Council of Ministers when the instrument was tabled. Furthermore, the Government states that it has submitted the draft regulation for consultation with the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation (CTV), which made it quite clear that it opposed the promulgation of the instrument.
.The Committee notes that the present complaint relates to the possible promulgation of a regulation amending the Labour Code concerning the exercise of the right to strike. According to the complainant organization, that decree would contravene the principles of freedom of association. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government states that this regulation has not been promulgated, as agreement has not been reached in the Council of Ministers and that the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation clearly expressed its opposition to the promulgation of that instrument.
.In the circumstances, as there is some uncertainty about the current situation of the draft regulation in question, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in the situation and recalls that the ILO is at the Government's disposal to provide any technical assistance it may deem necessary.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in respect of the draft regulation concerning the right to strike and recalls that the ILO is at the Government's disposal to provide any technical assistance it may deem necessary.",0,1992,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
312,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union Federation of Pilots and Professional Aviators of Venezuela (FESPAVEN) dated  March . The Government replied in a communication dated  August .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  March , the Trade Union Federation of Pilots and Professional Aviators of Venezuela (FESPAVEN) alleges that despite the existence of a collective agreement between the Venezuelan airline company (Aerovas Venezolanas S.A. (AVENSA)) and the AVENSA Pilots' Trade Union Association (ASPA) an anomalous situation has arisen which is destroying or at least threatening the right to organise and collective bargaining: the shareholders of AVENSA have formed another undertaking under the name of SERVIVENSA, which operates the same routes as AVENSA, serves as a backup for AVENSA's flights and uses pilots under contract to AVENSA.
.FESPAVEN explains that the new undertaking (SERVIVENSA) contracts individual pilots which leads them to create and register a company which is liable vis--vis third parties. Each pilot is thus considered an undertaking in himself and assumes the obligations incumbent upon employers under the Labour Act and other social and fiscal legislation, with regard to other persons called upon to provide the service.
.FESPAVEN adds that the situation created by the individual contracts between SERVIVENSA and the pilots has resulted in the disappearance of the social and employers' rights provided for in contracts of employment governed by the Labour Act (days off, public holidays, rest time, leave, etc.), in pilots' unlimited civil liability vis--vis third parties, and has meant that the pilot himself must pay transport costs for his food, hotel, uniforms and social security. It also means that there is no legal limit on flying hours, since the pilots are considered to be doing piece-work (although officially this abnormality is ""covered""), that air safety according to the standards of civil aviation legislation is disregarded, as are the standards of the ICAO and ILO. Meanwhile, the pilots working according to this schedule earn US$. per hour, whilst those covered by the collective agreement between AVENSA and ASPA receive a mere US$. per hour.
.Finally, FESPAVEN points out that the XX Congress of the International Pilots' Organisation held in March  adopted a resolution condemning the aforementioned forms of contract which jeopardise the collective agreement between AVENSA and the AVENSA Pilots' Trade Union Association, as well as the existence of the FESPAVEN itself.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government denies any violation of Convention No.  or of national legislation and points out that in accordance with article  of the Constitution of the Republic, which guarantees freedom to work, the AVENSA pilots unilaterally decided to work with the SERVIVENSA company. This new form of employment relationship is fully covered (without undermining the validity of collective bargaining or of the trade union) by the provisions in section  of the Labour Act as set out below (emphasis added):Contractors, defined as natural persons or bodies corporate that contract to perform work or services with their own resources, shall not be deemed to be middlemen and therefore shall not engage the liability of the person on whose account the work is done.This provision shall not apply to contractors whose activity is inherent in or directly associated with that of the person on whose account the work or service is performed.This means that for joint labour responsibility to exist between the contractor and the contracting party, namely SERVIVENSA and the registered company set up and registered by the pilot to negotiate commercial and labour relations with SERVIVENSA, the activity of both companies must be assimilable from the point of view of labour law. If this is so, and in accordance with section () of the Labour Act, the undertaking benefiting from the service, together with the enterprise as constituted by the pilot, shall be responsible for any non-fulfilment or breach of contract by the pilot with regard to the employment relationships of persons who provide services to the undertaking the pilot has registered and given legal status when working for SERVIVENSA. Consequently, the complainant cannot allege before the Committee on Freedom of Association that freedom of association has been violated on grounds of the non-fulfilment of labour obligations, as the status of ""contractor"" is covered by the Labour Act and therefore falls into the realm of public law and is binding.
.The Government considers that the complainant was wrong to have appealed to the Committee on Freedom of Association in relation to this new form of legal relationship between SERVIVENSA and the company constituted by the pilot without first having gone through the usual channels of appeal before the courts so that the courts themselves could decide whether, in this case, it was possible to apply the provisions of section  of the Labour Act, and, if not, whether the status of intermediary also provided for in the Act could be applied, as previously mentioned. So, these workers will continue to have the benefit of the collective agreement in force, on the basis of inherent or directly associated activities.
.Furthermore, the Government states that the Labour Act provides that ""it shall not be lawful to require or compel any person, directly or indirectly to become a member of an occupational association or to refrain from doing so"". Article  of Convention No.  also states that, in exercising the rights provided for in the Convention, trade union organisations, like other persons or organised collectivities, shall respect the law of the land. So, in the Government's opinion, if the pilots belonging to a trade union form undertakings to perform a specific task, they are doing so in accordance with Venezuelan legislation and in a manner which cannot be disputed by the Ministry of Labour since this activity is regulated by the laws of supply and demand and is covered by provisions found in other legislation of the Republic such as the Code of Commerce, freedom to work and freedom to organise. Both the SERVIVENSA undertaking and the pilots are applying provisions found in the Code of Commerce and the Labour Act.
.On the basis of the foregoing, the Government concludes by stating that pilots who form their own company to provide services as contractors, working for SERVIVENSA, have never violated Convention No. , the Constitution of the Republic or the Labour Act.
.In the present case, the complainant organisation objects to the repercussions in terms of trade union membership and collective bargaining of the change in the legal system which takes place when unionised workers (in this case, pilots) of an undertaking (AVENSA), with contracts of employment governed by ordinary legislation, and who are covered by a collective agreement, agree to act as contractors to an undertaking (SERVIVENSA) which is a subsidiary of the one in which they work, and sign a commercial contract to provide services, earning more than before but, according to the complainant, with conditions of employment falling below standards provided for in ordinary legislation and in the collective agreement (flying time, holidays, etc.). The Government, for its part, has stated that freedom to work is guaranteed by the Constitution, that the commercial contracts to provide services are in accordance with the legislation in force, that ""dependent workers"" of the pilots acting as contractors would be protected by labour legislation and the collective agreeement and that the SERVIVENSA undertaking, together with the pilots, are applying the provisions of the Code of Commerce and the Labour Act. The Committee observes, however, that the Government has not denied that a considerable number of conditions of employment applicable to pilots working as contractors fall below the levels provided for in labour legislation and the collective agreement.
.The Committee is aware that this new form of contract proposed to the pilots by the SERVIVENSA company might lead to a drop in the level of unionisation in this sector if a large number of AVENSA pilots belonging to the ASPA Pilots' Trade Union Association became parties, as contractors, to the special contracts for service with SERVIVENSA. That would be a situation which the Committee could not but deplore.
.However, the Committee must note that the complainant makes no mention in its complaint of any pressure placed on the pilots to make them sign the commercial contracts with the SERVIVENSA company. It therefore seems that the choice of the pilots who accepted signature of these commercial contracts was exercised in full freedom. In addition, the Committee notes that these contracts were not proposed by the AVENSA company, who is a signatory with the Pilots' Trade Union Association, but by another company, namely SERVIVENSA, even if SERVIVENSA is an affiliate of the former. The collective agreement therefore remains fully in force for the pilots who have chosen to remain salaried employees of the AVENSA company.
.In these circumstances, as long as the collective agreement in force between AVENSA and the Pilots' Trade Union Association does not have its",0,1992,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
313,"application called into question, the Committee cannot conclude that there has been a violation of the principles of freedom of association.

314,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Union of Press Workers (SNTP) dated  February . This organisation supplied additional information in a communication dated  March . The Government replied in a communication dated  August .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  February and  March , the National Union of Press Workers (SNTP) alleges that on the occasion of the national strike called by press workers to protest against censorship, to support freedom of expression and defend democracy, the Minister of Labour violated freedom of association by threatening media workers and sending in the National Guard to suppress their legitimate protests.
.In particular, the complainant alleges that anti-union sentiments lay behind the dismissals of Mario Villegas, the former Secretary-General of the SNTP and the trade union delegate of El Nacional; Francisco Solrzano, Secretary-General of the National College of Journalists of the Federal District, also an El Nacional trade union delegate; Luis Bazn Garca, Secretary-General of the College of Journalists of the State of Portuguesa and another six leaders from the same State. The complainant further alleges that the Venezuelan Press Corps acted in such a way as to impede trade union leaders' access to undertakings, thus violating clauses of the collective agreement and the rights of trade union organisations.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that on  February  there was an attempted coup d'tat against the duly elected Government, led by soldiers who through their actions violated the Constitution and national legislation. On  February  there was even an attempt on the life of the constitutional President of the Republic.
.The Government adds that it believed it was duty-bound to declare a state of emergency and, in accordance with the Constitution, to suspend constitutional guarantees as a result of the military and civilian insubordination in the principal States of the country. These guarantees included the right to freedom of expression and the right to strike. The Government states that in the circumstances, the complainant - as well as other trade unions - had no right to call a national strike in the graphic arts industry until the Decree suspending constitutional rights had been revoked, a condition which had not been respected by the complainant organisation.
.The Government further states that the trade union leaders and trade unionists who had been dismissed had been reinstated in their posts or had voluntarily accepted due compensation.
.The Committee notes the Government's explanations concerning the suspension of the right to strike (in particular, concerning the prohibition of the national strike called in the graphic arts industry) and the alleged restrictions on the right to freedom of expression. It observes that the Government's decisions had been taken in the context of a state of emergency called in accordance with the National Constitution as a result of an abortive coup d'tat against the Government and an attempt on the life of the President of the Republic.
.In this respect, the Committee has on numerous occasions considered that a general prohibition of strikes can only be justified in the event of an acute national emergency (Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ); the same applies to the restrictions on freedom of expression.
.In these circumstances, given that the restrictions on the right to strike and on freedom of expression were imposed against the backdrop of an attempted coup d'tat against the constitutional Government, the Committee considers that the Government has not violated freedom of association. Furthermore, the Committee notes that the dismissed trade unionists have been reinstated in their posts or have voluntarily accepted due compensation.

.The Committee had before it a representation for violation of Conventions Nos.  and , presented under article  of the ILO Constitution by the Organization of Employers (IOE) and the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers and Associations of Commerce and Production (FEDECAMARAS) (Case No. ).
.The Committee submits a report on this representation for the Governing Body's approval.
.The Committee examined this representation, which alleged the non-observance of Conventions Nos.  and , at its May  Session (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May )), in which it presented interim conclusions. The International Organization of Employers (IOE) submitted additional information in a communication of  September .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the allegations that remained pending refer to the incompatibility of two sections of the Organic Labour Act with Conventions Nos.  and .
.As regards the allegations concerning inequitable treatment favouring various economic chambers and bodies, as well as professional colleges, to the detriment of employers' organizations, concerning which the Government has not yet sent its observations, the Committee notes that section  of the Organic Labour Act provides as follows:Subject to prior registration with the Ministry of Labour, chambers of commerce, industry, agriculture or any other field of production or service, together with their federations and confederations, provided that they possess legal personality, may perform the functions accorded by the present Act to employers' associations. Similarly, subject to prior registration with the Ministry of Labour, legally established professional colleges and their federations and confederations shall enjoy equal rights to perform the functions of workers' trade unions in the representation of their members.
.In this respect the Committee notes that the IOE states that chambers of commerce, industry, agriculture and other legal entities of an associative type are not subject to the same requirements as employers' organizations as regards their constitution and the carrying out of their activities, which discourages the formation of organizations of this type. Among other things, the complainant indicates that - to the detriment of employers' organizations - associations of the type mentioned in section  enjoy the following benefits: () they are not required to have the same minimum number of workers in order to be established; () there are no legal restrictions on their functions and aims; () the procedure for their registration is simplified; () their registration may not be refused; () they do not need to notify the authorities of changes in their statutes or to provide information on their activities or their members; () the procedure for the election of their directors may be by acclamation, and periods of office may be longer; () they have greater powers of decision as regards control of their finances and the use to which these may be put.
.The Committee notes that chambers and other legal entities of an associative type may be formed and may perform the functions proper to employers' organizations, but that the establishment and operation of the latter is subject to requirements and limitations that appear to exceed the legal requirements to which chambers and other legal entities of an associative type are subject. In the view of the Committee this might influence the social partners at the time when they decide on their form of association (chamber or association on the one hand or occupational organization on the other). The Committee cannot exclude the hypothesis that the legislator may have attempted to take account of a de facto situation existing in the country at the time when the provisions of section  were included in the Organic Labour Act; nevertheless, one of the social partners has manifested its disagreement with the provision in question, since it would indirectly promote the formation of chambers or associations and would make it difficult to set up employers' organizations. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that it would be appropriate for the Government, in consultation with the organizations concerned, to take the necessary steps to bring the requirements for the establishment and functioning of ""employers' occupational associations"" into line with those governing chambers and civil associations, so as to ensure that ""employers' occupational associations"" are not restricted by excessively detailed provisions which discourage their establishment, contrary to Article  of Convention No. , which provides that employers, as well as workers, shall have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing without previous authorization.
.As regards section , to which the complainant organization takes exception, the Committee observes that, in submitting the representation, the IOE alleged that the provisions of this Article limit the possibility that two or more trade unions may exist in a single enterprise, and that according to the complainant organization this is contrary to the provisions of Convention No. . Subsequently, in submitting its additional information, the IOE added that the section concerned also violated the provisions of Convention No. , in particular that relating to the voluntary nature of negotiation. The Committee notes that the Government has not communicated its observations on these matters.
.As regards the first point, the Committee notes that the second paragraph of section  stipulates that a collective agreement may be negotiated only by a trade union representing an absolute majority of the workers in an enterprise. The Committee considers that this provision does not violate Convention No. , since it does not exclude the possibility of there being more than one trade union. The Committee nevertheless notes that the impugned provision also refers to the need for an absolute majority for bargaining purposes, and, in this sense, problems may arise with respect to the application of Article  of Convention No.  when no union in an enterprise or bargaining unit represents the absolute majority of workers; this would make it impossible for trade unions to negotiate a collective agreement, either jointly or separately. In these circumstances, and since it does not promote collective bargaining in the sense of Article  of Convention No. , the Committee invites the Government to take steps, in consultation with the organizations concerned, to amend the provision in question, so as to ensure that when no trade union represents the absolute majority of the workers the organizations may jointly negotiate a collective agreement applicable to the enterprise or the bargaining unit, or at least conclude a collective agreement on behalf of their members.
.As regards the second point mentioned by the IOE, respecting the first paragraph of section , the Committee notes that the complainant organization states that: () the provisions of this section allow a labour inspector discretionary powers to initiate a phase of negotiation between an employer and a trade union by the mere fact of taking cognizance of the existence of a collective dispute; () these powers allow inspectors to intervene even at stages when the planning of the conduct of the dispute is being organized; () the State reserves the right to intervene before either party is able to develop its programme of action; () labour inspectors are obliged to attempt to initiate a phase of bargaining regardless of whether the parties are interested in doing so; () these powers affect the impartiality of labour inspectors.
.The Committee observes that the first paragraph of section  provides that, on taking cognizance of the existence of a dispute of a collective nature, or when the matter comes up, the labour inspector shall attempt to initiate a phase of negotiation between the employer(s) and the trade union(s) concerned, and may take part in the discussions in person in an attempt to harmonize their interests and points of view. In this respect the Committee recalls that the Voluntary Conciliation and Arbitration Recommendation,  (No. ), advocates that: ""Voluntary conciliation machinery, appropriate to national conditions, should be made available to assist in the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes between employers and workers. ... Provision should be made to enable the procedure to be set in motion, either on the initiative of any of the parties to the dispute or ex officio by the voluntary conciliation authority."" The Committee concludes that the first paragraph of section  does not appear to exceed the admissible limits of intervention of the labour administration within the framework of voluntary conciliation according to this Recommendation. It is for the Committee of Experts to examine whether this provision exceeds the powers which the Labour Inspection Convention (No. ), , provides for labour inspectors. Nevertheless, the Committee cannot but observe that the first paragraph of section  is drafted in such broad terms as not to exclude",0,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
316,"an extensive interpretation and the concrete possibility that it may be applied to actual situations in which conciliation is neither necessary, appropriate nor desirable. In these circumstances, the Committee invites the Government to ensure that the application of this section by the administrative authorities of the Ministry of Labour does not depart from the principles contained in Recommendation No.  and guarantees the application of Article  of Convention No. , according to which the public authorities must encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary collective bargaining, as well as to proceed towards the creation of machinery for voluntary conciliation.
.Finally, as concerns the recommendations made during the examination of this representation at its May  meeting, the Committee notes the Government's statement that it is beginning a process of discussion and revision of the general regulations of the Organic Labour Act and that it undertakes to comply with the recommendations made by the Committee concerning these regulations. It also notes the decision of the Supreme Court, the highest judicial authority in Venezuela, according to which, in the case of conflict, the Conventions ratified by Venezuela shall prevail over the standards contained in the Organic Labour Act. Furthermore, the Committee notes and welcomes the decision of the Government to undertake discussions with the social partners and to exercise its legislative initiative so that the revision of the regulations takes into consideration the Committee's recommendations concerning the amendment of the following legislative provisions: sections  and  concerning the requirement of a minimum number to form workers' and employers' associations; sections  and  concerning the aims of employers' and workers' organizations; section  concerning the cause or motive for expelling a member of an organization; section  concerning trade union security clauses; sections  and  concerning the extension of collective agreements to workers who are not members of the organization which concluded them and the extension to departments or branches corresponding to distinct jurisdictions; section  concerning negotiation of collective contracts between non-unionized workers' representatives and employers; sections , , (e), , ,  and  concerning the extension of collective agreements; and section  concerning the limitation of the rights of foreign workers. The Committee trusts that the Government will include the provisions examined in its previous paragraphs as concerns sections  and  of the Organic Labour Act among the legislative provisions the Government proposes to examine with the social partners with a view to their amendment. Finally, noting that the Government states that it proposes to fulfil some of the Committee's recommendations by means of a regulation, the Committee wishes to insist upon the necessity of amending the legislation in the sense indicated and that regulatory changes are insufficient.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee considers that it would be appropriate for the Government, in consultation with the organizations concerned, to take the necessary steps to bring the requirements for the establishment and operation of ""employers' occupational associations"" into line with those for chambers and civil associations, so as to ensure that ""employers' occupational associations"" are not restricted by excessively detailed provisions which discourage their establishment, contrary to Article  of Convention No. , which provides that employers, as well as workers, shall have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing without previous authorization.(b) As regards the provision that a collective agreement may be negotiated only by the union which represents an absolute majority of the workers in an enterprise (second paragraph of section  of the Organic Labour Act), the Committee considers that this provision does not promote collective bargaining in the sense of Article  of Convention No. , and requests the Government, in consultation with the organizations concerned, to take steps to amend the provision in question, so as to ensure that, in cases where no trade union represents the majority of workers, the minority organizations may jointly negotiate a collective agreement applicable to the enterprise or bargaining unit, or at least conclude a collective agreement on behalf of their own members.(c) Regarding the labour inspector's powers of initiating a phase of negotiation on taking cognizance of the existence of a dispute of a collective nature, or when the matter comes up (first paragraph of section  of the Organic Labour Act), the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the application of this section by the administrative authorities of the Ministry of Labour guarantees the application of Article  of Convention No. , according to which the public authorities must encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary collective bargaining, as well as to proceed towards the creation of voluntary conciliation machinery.(d) The Committee trusts that the Government will include the provisions examined in its previous paragraphs as concerns sections  and  of the Organic Labour Act among the legislative provisions which the Government proposes to examine with the social partners with a view to their amendment.(e) The Committee draws this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.

Later, in a communication of  March , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS sent additional information. The Government sent its observations in a communication of  January .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  July  and  March  the International Organization of Employers (IOE) and the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers and Associations of Commerce and Production (FEDECAMARAS) allege that the new Organic Labour Act of Venezuela, promulgated at the end of  and in force since  May , contains provisions which are at variance with Conventions Nos.  and .
.As regards Convention No. , the complainant organizations state that Title VII, Chapter I, of the Organic Labour Act contains provisions contrary to the fundamental principles established by this Convention. Specifically, they state that:- section  gives favourable attention to the extension of collective agreements to ""workers not affiliated to the trade unions that have concluded them"" as a prelude to the provisions in Chapter V, Division I, establishing machinery conducive to trade union monopoly, with results which appear to be contrary to the principles of the Convention and to the very provisions contained in section  of the Organic Labour Act;- the note of section  seriously limits the rights conferred upon foreign workers by the Convention. It permits them to serve on the management committee of a trade union and act as its representative only if they have been resident in the country for more than ten years. In addition, all foreigners with ten or more years of residence in the country require the prior authorization of the Ministry of Labour to be able to exercise the rights granted by the Convention;- section  is discriminatory. It establishes inequitable treatment favouring various economic chambers and bodies, as well as professional associations, to the detriment of employers' organizations;- section  requires that all occupational associations be of a permanent nature, and is thus at variance with the right of employers and workers to form organizations of their own choosing and, especially, to draw up their constitutions and rules, organize their activities and formulate their programmes. It prevents employers and workers from establishing organizations on a temporary basis for specific ends;- section  constitutes unnecessary government interference in the exercise of the rights established under the Convention.- section , and especially the provisions contained in subsections (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k), diminishes the guarantees provided for in the Convention. The aims established under subsection (g) of this section may be used to discourage the creation or development of small trade unions. Not all trade unions have the funds",0,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
317,"necessary to create ""industrial or vocational schools, public libraries and sports, recreational or travel clubs"". The same is true for the provisions of section , subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i), as regards the right of employers to establish organizations of their own choosing. Subsection (d) of both sections, for example, obliges both employers' associations and trade unions to represent non-members;- section  places a further restriction on the freedom of association guaranteed by the Convention to employers, especially in view of the fact that this restriction does not apply to the establishment of chambers of commerce, industry, agriculture or any other branch of production or services which acquire legal personality under civil law, these too being organizations which are protected by the guarantees provided for in the Convention;- section  prevents employers' associations and trade unions from organizing at the regional or national level if they do not first comply with the registration requirements of the Labour Inspectorate;- sections  and  regulate in excessive detail the content of occupational associations' constitutions and tend to limit the right of employers and workers freely to formulate their programmes. These provisions do not constitute a minimum set of requirements, but rather impose an organizational model. Subsection (i) of section  imposes a single and ambiguous ""democratic"" ideology on all occupational associations of employers and workers, which may facilitate and permit interference by the labour administration authorities in the creation, organization and operation of occupational associations. Subsection (p) is ambiguous and gives the competent authorities additional discretionary powers. These sections are at variance with the provisions of section , which recognizes the right of employers and workers to establish organizations of their own choosing, ""to draw up their own constitutions and rules, freely to elect the members of their management committees, to plan and organize their own administration and to establish guidelines for their activities"". The detailed regulation established by sections  and  serves to diminish the guarantees provided for by the Convention. Venezuelan civil law does not establish such conditions for the registration and obtaining of legal personality by chambers of commerce, industry, agriculture and other branches of production and services, yet they too are covered by the Convention under Article ;- section  grants the labour inspector excessive discretionary power to reject the registration of occupational associations, especially when determining whether they comply with the requirements of the above-outlined provisions of sections  and ;- subsection (c) of section  grants the labour inspector the discretionary power to decide what constitutes a fault or omission in the constitution, the internal rules or the list of founder members which the occupational association is required to submit in order for the inspector to accept the registration application. Section  imposes, rather than suggests, a strict framework for the contents of associations' constitutions, and the decision as to whether there are faults or omissions will depend on the criteria applied by the inspector or the interpretation given to the instructions received from above;- section  makes provision for ""a definitive refusal"" to register a trade union organization, in clear contradiction of Article , paragraph , of the Convention;- section  allows the labour authorities to prevent workers' and employers' organizations whose constitutions, administrative regulations and organizational arrangements are not in keeping with the legislature's concepts or do not accommodate the point of view or ideas of the labour inspector, from obtaining a legal personality;- section  of Title VII, Chapter II, Division V, ""On the Protection of Freedom of Association"" is contrary to the principle of freedom of association in that it imposes special mandatory trade union dues ""as a token of solidarity"" on workers who are not members of a union but who benefit from a collective agreement, without taking into consideration the question of whether such workers wish to benefit from the collective agreement and without their having participated in the fixing of the amounts of these trade union dues. The contribution established ""as a token of solidarity"" is intended to lead in the short or medium-term to trade union unity.- section  of the same Division amounts to overt interference in the administration of employers' and workers' organizations in that it specifically and exclusively limits the causes or reasons for which an organization may expel one of its members;- section  limits the possibility that two or more trade unions may exist in a single enterprise;- section  of Chapter IV contains provisions which may undermine the right of workers to establish organizations of their own choosing and to join organizations as they see fit.
.As regards Convention No. , the complainant organizations allege that the Organic Labour Act does away with the notion of the collective agreement as a document setting out working conditions between groups of non-unionized workers and an employer or employers, as opposed to collective agreements negotiated by unionized workers and employers, whether they are organized or not. This omission offers non-unionized workers no way of obtaining legal security in their relations with the employers, especially since section , of Title VII, Chapter II, Division II, requires a minimum of  workers to form a trade union. Thus, workers at small and medium-sized enterprises have no alternative to becoming members of industrial, sectorial or professional trade unions, a situation which tends to remove vitality and dynamism from the freedom of action of workers' groups which are isolated from the headquarters of such organizations or are beyond the reach of their activities.
.The complainant organizations further state that:- sections  and  of Title VII, Chapter II, Division V, are clear examples of government interference in the free negotiation of union security clauses, and section  seriously limits the rights of employers' and workers' organizations to negotiate the conditions of work they consider most appropriate to their respective interests;- section , Title VII, Chapter IV, extends to non-unionized workers or members of other trade unions the stipulations of collective agreements, converting them into binding clauses for those workers;- the note of section  empowers the Ministry of Labour ""ex officio"" to convene a standard-setting labour meeting to extend to employers and workers of a given sector of activity the conditions of work agreed upon by trade unions and employers representing a majority of that sector of production or commerce;- section  empowers the Ministry of Labour to ""harmonize working conditions"", by modifying or by cancelling collective agreements concluded by trade unions and employers representing the minority and in force when the standard-setting labour meeting is convened;- section , subsection (e) empowers the Ministry of Labour to suspend the negotiation of collective agreements with minority employers who have been convoked according to a summary procedure;- section  empowers the Ministry to impose on organized employers and workers who leave the meeting or fail to attend ""more than  per cent of its sessions"" the collective agreement concluded at the standard-setting labour meeting;- the note of section  empowers the Ministry of Labour to declare ""ex officio"" as participants in a standard-setting labour meeting one or more employers or employers' organizations ""and one or more trade unions, trade union federations or confederations having voluntarily met with a view to negotiating a collective labour agreement for a given sector of activity ..."";- section  confers upon the government official presiding over the standard-setting labour meeting the legal competence to ""take decisions on all matters which may arise in it, in accordance with the procedures established by the present Act"". However, the Act does not establish such procedures and does not determine whether this competence extends to legal questions;- section  is at variance with the fundamental principles of the Convention in that it establishes that ""when one or more employers, trade unions or federations of trade unions have not been invited to or have not attended a standard-setting labour meeting in their branch of activity, the petitions introduced with respect to them shall be dealt with exclusively in a conciliatory manner, and any agreement reached shall be conditional upon the outcome of the standard-setting labour meeting ..."". The nature of this provision undermines the autonomy of the negotiating parties and is an obstacle to free collective bargaining. It subjects the outcome of voluntary negotiation to the economic or political criteria of the labour administration authority.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that section  of the new Organic Labour Act in no way undermines the guarantees provided for by Convention No. , pointing out that the payment of solidarity trade union dues is not a prerequisite to workers' benefiting from collective agreements, but rather that those workers who do benefit from collective agreements have a special union due deducted from their wages, unless they belong to another trade union. It points out that it is fair for those benefiting from the work of the trade union to contribute to the costs incurred during the negotiation of the agreement.
.The Government adds in its observations concerning the allegations",1,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
318,"of non-observance of Convention No.  that the right to establish trade unions is an aspect of freedom of association established in article  of the National Constitution, and that the Civil Code, the Code of Commerce, the Act on Political Parties and the Act on Cooperatives cover in detail the right of association of Venezuelans, and that none of these legal texts undermine this right, although they stipulate that a number of requirements - in the interests both of the State and of individuals - must be met when these bodies are established. Similarly, the Government states that the requirement for occupational associations to register in order to obtain legal personality is limited to a simple verification that minimum requirements for their operation have been met, and that these requirements are described in detail in the Act and not left to the discretion of the supervisory authority. Finally, it points out that sections  and  set out the minimum requirements for the content of constitutions without in any way limiting the right to add other objectives.
.As regards the non-observance of Convention No. , and more specifically negotiations with a group of workers (non-unionized), the Government states that it is untrue that the practices and the main trend in respect of collective bargaining is for direct negotiations to be held between workers and employers, disregarding occupational organizations (the Government includes statistics to this effect). Experience has shown in Venezuela that workers' groups, owing to their lack of organization, lack sufficient strength to oblige employers to negotiate conditions of work; the few agreements concluded by groups of workers more closely resemble contracts of acceptance than instruments regulating the worker-employer relationship. Moreover, workers' groups have at times been used surreptitiously by employers to instigate anti-union activities. The Government concludes on this point by mentioning that the Organic Labour Act was promulgated with the aim of enabling the development of the trade union movement, and that none of the provisions of Convention No.  deal with workers' groups.
.As regards the allegations concerning the number of workers required to form a trade union, the Government states that section  of the Organic Labour Act stipulates that  or more workers of the same profession, occupation or employment, or who work in enterprises within the same sector of industry or commerce may form a union; this provision stipulates the same number of workers required as did section  of the regulations of the former Labour Act. The Government explains that the difference with the new Act is that it covers the establishment of national or regional trade unions with a minimum of  workers, and the possibility of forming independent trade unions with a minimum of  workers of the same profession. Finally, the Government points out that with the formation of regional and national trade unions by branch of activity, the problem of small enterprises having fewer than  workers may be solved, and that section  of the Organic Labour Act stipulates that  or more workers may form a works union, as did section  of the regulations of the former Labour Act.
.The Committee observes that this case refers to the alleged contradiction of some provisions of the Organic Labour Act, which entered into force in May , with Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded to all the allegations. All the same, because of the time which has elapsed since this representation was presented, the Committee is obliged to examine some of these allegations without having the corresponding observations at its disposal.
.As regards the allegation concerning the restriction of freedom of association by virtue of section , which stipulates that ""ten () or more employers engaged in the same industry or activity, or similar or related industries or activities, may form an employers' association"", the Government has not sent any observations on this point. The Committee considers that a minimum number of ten is extremely high and violates the employers' right to form organizations of their own choosing. In these circumstances, in order to bring the legislation into line with the principles of freedom of association, the minimum number required by law should be reduced, after consultation with the organizations concerned.
.As regards the allegation concerning the considerable increase in the minimum number of workers required to form a trade union, the Committee notes that the Government states that regarding the establishment of trade unions in a given profession, occupation or type of employment, or of workers who work in enterprises within the same sector of industry or commerce, the minimum number of  workers required by section  of the Organic Labour Act is the same as the number in section  of the regulations of the former Labour Act. The Committee observes that this provision has not been criticized by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. The Committee is of the view, however, that given the prevailing circumstances in this case, it would be appropriate to consider with employers' and workers' organizations the possibility of reducing this number.
.As regards the required number of  workers to form a works union (section ), the Government points out that it has not changed the number stipulated under section  of the former regulations. The Committee emphasizes that it has always maintained that: ""The legal requirement that there be a minimum number of  members to form a union does not seem excessive and, therefore, does not in itself constitute an obstacle to the formation of a trade union"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ). The Committee understands that the law, by setting a minimum number of  workers, intended to avoid a high degree of trade union fragmentation and observes that the Committee of Experts also has never criticized this minimum number. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this provision does not violate in itself the principle of freedom of association.
.As regards the allegation concerning the impossibility for occupational organizations to determine freely their objectives (sections  and ), the Committee notes that according to the Government, these sections of the new Act set out the minimum requirements that have to be met by constitutions, while in no way limiting the right to add other objectives. The Committee observes that even if subsection (l) of section  (workers' organizations) and subsection (j) of section  (employers' organizations) stipulate that the organizations may determine their functions and aims in accordance with their statutes or the will of their members in order to further their aims, these two sections impose, in addition, various objectives which have to be met compulsorily. The Committee concludes that the mandatory list of functions and aims that associations must have is excessively extensive and detailed. In these circumstances, given the possibility that such detailed and demanding prescriptions may in practice hinder the establishment and development of the organizations, the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to changing the legislation, in consultation with workers' and employers' organizations, so that it sets out in general terms that the objectives of these organizations may be any which aim at promoting and defending the interests of their members (in a manner similar to that of section  of the Act), leaving to the organizations the task of defining in their constitutions the specific objectives that they would like to pursue.
.As regards the allegation concerning the requirement for all occupational associations to be of a permanent nature (section ), preventing employers and workers from establishing organizations on a temporary basis for specific ends, the Government has not sent observations. The Committee points out that in general the permanent nature of workers' and employers' organizations is beneficial to the promotion and defence of the interests of their members. None the less, the Committee understands that the creation of organizations for temporary aims may be legitimate and useful in certain circumstances.
.As regards the allegation to the effect that sections  and  regulate in excessive detail the content of occupational associations' constitutions and serve to limit the right of employers and workers freely to formulate their programmes, by imposing in subsection (i) of section  a single democratic ideology and giving in subsection (p) of the same section additional discretionary powers to the competent authorities, the Government has not sent observations. After thorough examination of the subsections contested by the complainant organizations, the Committee observes with regard to the allegation concerning the imposition of a single democratic ideology (section , subsection (i)), that the intent of the Act is to ensure the effective participation of members in the life of the association, by requiring the election of their management committees in accordance with democratic principles. On previous occasions, the Committee has criticized legal provisions which establish a set majority for the election of officials, but not those which provide for the respect of democratic principles, as is",-1,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
319,"the case in subsection (i) of section . Moreover, with regard to the alleged discretionary power given to the authorities by subsection (p) of the same section (""any other provision aimed at improving the organization's operation""), the Committee observes that this is an optional provision, which by nature does not limit the rights of associations, since it does not impose the ""other provisions"".
.As regards the allegation concerning the limitation of the rights of foreign workers, by preventing them from acting as representatives or serving on the management committees of their organizations unless they have been resident in the country for more than ten years (section ), the Government has not sent any observations. The Committee reminds the Government that upon examination of the contents of the Organic Labour Act from the point of view of the application of Convention No. , the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at its  meeting sent a direct request to the Government, emphasizing that section  required an excessively long qualifying period for foreigners to serve in occupational associations. The Committee is also of the view that a period of ten years' residency is excessive, and invites the Government to remove this requirement, or at least to modify it as suggested by the Committee of Experts, which considers that this legislation should be made flexible so as to permit the organizations to elect their leaders freely and without hindrance, and to permit foreign workers' access to trade union posts, at least after a reasonable period of residency in the host country.
.As regards the allegation concerning the interference of the authorities in the administration of employers' and workers' organizations, in so far as the Act specifically and exclusively limits the causes or reasons for which an organization may expel one of its members (section ), the Committee considers that the four reasons provided for by the Act to expel members from a trade union organization or deprive them of their rights, which are listed hereunder, are not in themselves at variance with the principles of freedom of association: (a) embezzlement or misappropriation of the organization's funds; (b) refusal to comply with a decision taken by the assembly within the exercise of its legitimate powers, provided the interested party was aware of, or should have been aware of, the said decision; (c) disclosure of deliberations and decisions which the organization has designated confidential; and (d) immoral behaviour clearly contrary to collective interests. None the less, the Committee shares the point of view of the complainant organizations that it would be more appropriate if these or other reasons were regulated by the organizations' constitutions and not by the Act.
.As regards the allegation concerning the mandatory registration of employers' and workers' organizations (section ) and the requirement to obtain that registration in order to have a legal personality (section ), thus limiting the right of association and hindering the formation of organizations, the Committee observes that according to the Government, the requirement for occupational associations to register in order to have a legal personality is a simple verification to ensure that minimum requirements for their operation have been met, and that these requirements are described in detail by the Act and not left to the discretion of the supervisory authority. The Committee observes that section  of the Organic Labour Act stipulates that occupational associations (of workers or employers) wishing to organize at the regional or national level must register with the National Labour Inspectorate, that section  provides that the labour inspector shall receive the registration application from an occupational association and within  days shall order the registration, that section  stipulates that registration may be denied to an organization only in specific cases (if the organizations do not have as objectives the aims provided by law; if the organization has been established without the legal minimum number of members; if there are faults or omissions in the act of constitution, the internal rules and the list of founding members, or if any of these documents are lacking; finally if the association takes the name of an already existing organization), and that section  stipulates that the registration of an organization grants it legal personality.
.On previous occasions, the Committee has noted that ""if the conditions for the granting of registration are tantamount to obtaining prior permission from the public authorities for the establishment or functioning of a trade union this would undeniably constitute an infringement of the Convention. This, however, would not seem to be the case when the registration of trade unions consists solely of a formality and where the conditions are not such as to impair the guarantees laid down by the Convention"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). The sections of the Organic Labour Act would appear to limit the registration procedure to a simple verification that legal requirements have been fulfilled (with the exception of the provision mentioned in paragraph  of these conclusions, concerning the obligations and functions of occupational associations), and that these requirements merely consist of formalities which are not subject to the discretion of the authorities. The Committee nevertheless considers that the decisions of the labour inspector concerning registration should be subject to judicial review before an independent judicial authority.
.As regards the allegation concerning government interference in the free negotiation of union security clauses (section ) and the limitation of the rights of employers' and workers' organizations to negotiate the conditions of work they consider most appropriate to their respective interests, the Government has not sent observations. The Committee observes that section  provides that ""the exercise of freedom of association shall not prevent the most representative trade union in an enterprise or occupation from requesting the employer or employers interested in a collective negotiation to produce trade union forms for the recruitment of workers within the terms of the present Act"". Similarly, the Committee observes that section  stipulates that ""a collective agreement may contain clauses giving the contracting trade union with the largest number of members the right to provide the employer with up to  per cent of the personnel he requires"". As regards section , given that it stipulates that a specific type of clause may be negotiated within the framework of agreements, the Committee concludes that this provision does not violate the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the allegation that under the terms of section  employers, without the prior authorization of workers, are obliged to withhold special trade union dues from workers' wages when they are not unionized in order for them to benefit from a collective agreement, the Committee notes that according to the Government, the payment of a solidarity fee is not required for workers to benefit from collective agreements. A special contribution is deducted from the wages of workers benefiting from collective agreements unless they belong to another trade union, since in all fairness those benefiting from the work of the trade union should contribute to the expenses incurred during the discussion of the agreement. The Committee observes that section  of the Organic Labour Act establishes that:Employers shall deduct from the wages or salaries of trade union members the regular or special contributions fixed by a trade union in accordance with its statutes. Workers who are not members of a union which has concluded a collective agreement from which they benefit, and who are not members of another union, shall have such special contributions deducted from their wages or salaries as a token of solidarity and in recognition of the benefits so obtained. The employer shall hand over the sums collected to the authorized representatives of the trade union as soon as the collection has taken place.
.The Committee must recall that at its November  Session it examined the question of trade union solidarity dues in Venezuela (see th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )) and considered that ""problems related to union security clauses should be resolved at the national level, in conformity with national practice and the industrial relations system in each country"", and that ""both situations where union security clauses are authorized and those where these are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association"". None the less, when legislation admits trade union security clauses such as the withholding of trade union dues from the wages of non-members benefiting from the conclusion of a collective agreement, those clauses should only take effect through collective agreements. In this regard, the Committee observes in the present case that the Act authorizes the trade union to set unilaterally and to receive from non-members the amount of the special contribution set for members, as a token of solidarity and in recognition of the benefits obtained from the collective agreement. The Committee concludes that to bring this in line with the principles of freedom of association, the Act should establish the possibility for both parties",1,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
320,"acting together - and not the trade union unilaterally - to agree in collective agreements to the possibility of collecting such a contribution from non-members for the benefits that they may enjoy. In these circumstances, the Committee invites the Government to take the necessary measures to modify, as suggested above, the provisions of section  on trade union security clauses.
.As regards the allegation concerning the limitation of collective bargaining to unionized workers, the Committee notes that according to the Government, and contrary to the allegations, the practice and the main trend in respect of collective bargaining do not consist in direct negotiations being held between workers and employers with occupational associations being disregarded, and that the new Act stipulates that collective bargaining shall be held with trade union organizations representative of the workers in order to permit the development of the trade union movement. The Committee notes that, as the complainant organizations point out, section  of the Organic Labour Act does not refer to non-unionized workers since it defines the collective labour agreement as ""one concluded between one or more workers' trade unions or federations or confederations on the one hand and one or more employers or employers' associations on the other, with a view to establishing the conditions under which work is to be done together with the rights and obligations accruing to each of the parties"". Since the Organic Labour Act does not provide for the possibility, in the absence of trade union organizations, for representatives of the workers to negotiate with employers, and taking into consideration the concern expressed by the complainant organizations, the Committee requests the Government to study with the social partners the possibility of amending section , taking into account the pertinent provisions of the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ): ""For the purpose of this Recommendation, the term 'collective agreements' means all agreements in writing regarding working conditions and terms of employment concluded between an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more representative workers' organizations, or, in the absence of such organizations, the representatives of the workers duly elected and authorized by them in accordance with national laws and regulations, on the other.""
.The Committee emphasizes that the said Recommendation stresses the role of workers' organizations as one of the parties in collective bargaining. Direct negotiation between the undertaking and its employees, by-passing representative organizations where these exist, might in certain cases be detrimental to the principle that negotiation between employers and organizations of workers should be encouraged and promoted (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). The Committee recalls the importance of the independence of the parties in collective bargaining (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.As regards the allegation concerning the extension of collective agreements to workers not affiliated to the trade unions that have concluded them (section ), by establishing machinery which could lead to trade union monopoly, with results which would appear to be contrary to the principles contained in Convention No.  and section  of the Organic Labour Act, the Government has not sent any observations. The Committee notes that section  provides that ""collective labour agreements shall prevail against all other forms of law, contract or agreement in so far as they are of benefit to employees. Their extension to workers not affiliated to the trade unions that have concluded them shall be given favourable attention"". The Committee would like to emphasize that when the extension of the agreement applies to non-member workers of enterprises covered by the collective agreement, this situation in principle does not contradict freedom of association principles, in so far as under the law, it is the most representative organization that negotiates on behalf of all workers, and the enterprises do not have a number of establishments (a situation which will be examined later). It should, however, be emphasized that the wording of this section is too general and that it would be appropriate for the Act to clarify in what circumstances the extension may apply, and whether it may apply in other cases as well. If this is indeed possible, then the legal guarantees provided for in the ""standard-setting labour meeting"" and mentioned two paragraphs below should be respected.
.As regards the allegations to the effect that the provisions of sections , , (e), , ,  and  are at variance with the principles contained in Convention No. , the Government has not sent any observations. The Committee observes that the question concerning the extension of collective agreements which was dealt with in the preceding paragraph arises again in those allegations, albeit at a higher level. The Committee wishes to point out that the Act deals with a practice current in many countries, which admit it on the condition that it be accompanied by certain guarantees. Under this practice a collective labour agreement with effect for an activity or occupation within a specific geographic area may be applied in other areas for the same activity or occupation. Generally, the extension may not take place from one activity or occupation to another, either within the same geographic area or outside it. Recourse to extension is used to avoid problems relating to economic competition (when in one area, for lack of a collective agreement, less favourable wages or working conditions keep labour costs down), to compensate for the workers' inability to negotiate collectively or organize trade unions. The intended aim is to make up for this shortcoming and reduce its possible effects within the country's economy. In the Committee's opinion, any extension should take place subject to tripartite analysis of the consequences it would bring in the sector to which it is applied. In these circumstances, observing that a representative of the Government and representatives of employers and workers participate in all standard-setting labour meetings (sections  and ), thus providing the possibility for any of them to oppose extension of the agreement (section , paragraph ), the Committee concludes that the provisions in the first section concerning the standard-setting labour meetings are not contrary to the principles of freedom of association. None the less, the Committee considers that this section of the Act should specifically state that, before proceeding to any extension, the social partners should analyse the consequences that it would have on the sector to which it is applied.
.As regards the allegation to the effect that section  contains provisions which may undermine the right of workers to form and join organizations of their own choosing, the Government has not sent any observations. The Committee notes that the text of this section establishes the following: ""Where an enterprise has departments or branches in various jurisdictions, agreements between it and a trade union representing a majority of its employees shall apply to employees in such departments or branches."" In the view of the Committee, it would be appropriate, in conformity with the principle of voluntary and free negotiation, for the Act to be modified so that it is left to the parties to decide on the matter.
.As regards the allegations concerning inequitable treatment favouring various economic chambers and bodies, as well as professional colleges, to the detriment of employers' organizations (section ), and the limitation of the possibility that two or more trade unions may exist in a single enterprise (section ), the Committee requests the complainant organizations and the Government to clarify the problems that exist in a more detailed manner, by explaining in what ways these sections restrict the rights of workers and workers' organizations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the social partners, to take measures with a view to modifying the provisions of the Organic Labour Act which are at variance with the principles of freedom of association, particularly as regards the following points:- as regards the provisions of section  of the Organic Labour Act, the Committee considers that they infringe the right of employers to form organizations of their own choosing and that it would be appropriate to reduce the minimum number required by law after consultation with the organizations concerned;- as regards the allegation concerning section  of the Act, the Committee considers that, given the prevailing circumstances in this case, it would be appropriate, in consultation with workers' and employers' organizations, to examine the possibility of reducing the minimum number of workers necessary to form a trade union;- as regards the allegation concerning the provisions of sections  and  of the Act, the Committee considers that the Government should, in consultation with workers' and employers' organizations, take measures to modify the legislation so that it sets out in general terms the objectives of workers' and employers' organizations and leaves to the organizations to define in their constitutions the specific aims that they wish to pursue;- as regards the allegation concerning the limitation of the rights of foreign workers contained in section ,",1,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
321,"the Committee considers that the requirement of a minimum period of ten years' residency in order for these workers to exercise the functions of trade union representatives or become members of the management committee of their organization is an excessive condition; it asks the Government to remove this requirement or to modify it in the manner suggested by the Committee of Experts;- as regards the allegation concerning the interference of the authorities in the administration of employers' and workers' organizations, in so far as the Act specifically and exclusively limits the causes or reasons for which an organization may expel one of its members (section ), the Committee considers that it would be more appropriate if these or other reasons were regulated by the organizations' constitutions and not by the Act;- as regards the allegation concerning compulsory trade union dues provided for in section  of the Act, the Committee considers that to bring this in line with the principles of freedom of association, the Act should establish the possibility for both parties acting together - and not the trade union unilaterally - to agree in collective agreements to the possibility of collecting such a contribution from non-members for the benefits that they may enjoy. The Committee invites the Government to take the necessary measures to modify, as suggested above, the provisions of section  on trade union security clauses;- as regards the allegation concerning the negotiation of collective agreements between the representatives of non-unionized workers and employers, the Committee requests the Government to study, in consultation with the social partners, how section  should be modified, taking into account the provisions contained in this respect in the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. );- as regards the allegation concerning the extension of collective agreements to workers not affiliated to the trade unions that have concluded them, the Committee considers that the wording of section  is too general and that it would be appropriate for the Act to specify in which conditions such an extension may apply in effect, as suggested in the conclusions;- as regards the allegations concerning the extension of collective agreements as provided for under sections , , (e), , ,  and , the Committee considers that this part of the Act should specifically state that any extension should take place subject to analysis by the social partners of the consequences that it would have on the sector to which it is applied;- as regards the allegation concerning section , the Committee considers that that provision should be amended, so that the parties to collective bargaining make the decision as to whether the collective agreements in undertakings should apply to branches in other locations.(b) As regards the allegations concerning inequitable treatment favouring various economic chambers and bodies, as well as professional colleges, to the detriment of employers' organizations (section ), and the limitation of the possibility that two or more trade unions may exist in a single enterprise (section ), the Committee requests the complainant organizations and the Government to clarify the problems that exist in a more detailed manner by explaining in what ways these sections restrict the rights of employers' and workers' organizations.",1,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
322,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Latin American Federation for Education and Cultural Workers (FLATEC) dated  November . The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) supported the complaint in communications dated  December  and  January  respectively. The Government's reply is contained in a communication dated  August .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisations state that on  March  the Ministry of Education and seven Venezuelan teachers' federations signed the third collective agreement governing the employment relationship between workers in the teaching profession and the Ministry of Education. Clause  of the agreement states:The Ministry of Education undertakes as from the date of the signature and deposit of this collective agreement to continue to deduct uninterruptedly, through the presently operating payment mechanisms, the regular and special contributions of the workers of the educational system members of the signatory workers' organisations and to effect any other deduction in respect of any one of the said signatory workers' organisations. The Ministry of Education may not suspend or withdraw these deductions except in pursuance of a prior interim order or final and express decision by a competent ordinary court. Even in the event of a dispute the amount of such deduction shall be remitted every fortnight to the organisation concerned. Likewise, the Ministry binds itself to withhold and to remit to the signatory workers' organisations, on one single occasion, the total of the monthly pay increase fixed in this contract for each of the workers in the educational system beneficiaries of the contract. The total amount of the deduction in respect of the members of the signatory workers' organisation concerned shall be remitted to that organisation.
.The complainants add that, with the object of weakening the teachers' federations, the Minister of Education, acting in an authoritative manner and interfering in trade union affairs, circulated with the Ministry of Education's pay slip a printed sheet of paper mentioning that it was open to the teacher to waive payment of the special contribution and that, if the teacher signed the paper, the said contribution would not be deducted. The complainants explain that this special contribution corresponds to the one month's pay increase obtained through collective bargaining and that this contribution applies to workers in the education system, whether members or not members of the workers' organisations, and is intended for the workers' federations.
.Lastly, the complainants allege that on  May  the Venezuelan Teachers' Federation formally demanded in writing that the Minister of Education comply with the terms of clause  of the collective agreement referred to above. They state that on  October  this demand was reiterated by the seven federations signatories of the agreement. They state further that by the date of the submission of the complaint by FLATEC to the Committee ( November ) there had been no reply, nor have the special contributions representing the pay increase obtained through collective bargaining been deducted.
.In its communication dated  August  the Government states that, in order to terminate the administrative proceedings instituted in the Inspectorate of Labour of the Federal District, on the grounds of alleged breaches by the Ministry of Education of the terms of clause  of the third collective agreement concluded on  March  between the Ministry and the seven Venezuelan teachers' federations, the parties concerned signed a document of settlement on  February  (one of the signatories being the trade union leader who had signed the complaint submitted to the Committee by FLATEC). According to the settlement, the Ministry undertakes to deduct and to remit to the Venezuelan workers' organisations concerned the regular and special contributions referred to in the third collective agreement concerning workers in the education system, whether members or not members of the said organisations, in conformity with the terms of clause .
.The Government adds that as from  June  the Ministry of Education has been deducting, in respect of every teacher, whether or not a member of the workers' organisations, the regular and special contributions referred to in clause  of the collective agreement, thus complying with the provisions of the said clause and with section  of the Organic Labour Act. The contribution withheld from the teachers' pay amounts to  million bolivares.
.However, the Government goes on to say, the Ministry of Education has deposited this sum in a trust account with the Central Bank of Venezuela. The reason for this was that on  July  the Attorney-General of the Republic applied to the Supreme Court of Justice for a ruling declaring void part of section  of the Organic Labour Act. That section states:Employers shall deduct from the wages or salaries of trade union members the regular or special contributions fixed by a trade union in accordance with its statutes. Workers who are not members of a union which has concluded a collective agreement from which they benefit, and who are not members of another union, shall have such special contributions deducted from their wages or salaries as a token of solidarity and in recognition of the benefits so obtained. The employer shall hand over the sums collected to the authorised representatives of the trade union as soon as the collection has taken place.The Attorney-General considers that it is not only unconstitutional but also unlawful to withhold part of a worker's pay for remittance to the union if the worker is not a member of the union; the Attorney-General also considers that there is no true justice if the worker is obliged, without his permission or against his will, to make a financial contribution to a union of which he is not a member or whose membership he has left, which shows that section  of the Organic Labour Act is in breach of the protection of wages, which is a principle of vital importance for the worker.
.The Government adds that, in this context, the Attorney-General has applied to the Supreme Court for a ruling declaring section  of the Organic Labour Act to be void in part, in the light of the provisions of article  of the Constitution of Venezuela, read in conjunction with section  of the said Act, which state that the wage cannot be waived and the terms of which are reproduced below:Article  of the Constitution:Provision shall be made by legislation for the means conducive to obtaining a fair wage; the legislation shall enact rules for ensuring that every worker receives at least a minimum wage; it shall guarantee equal pay for equal work; it shall fix the share due to the workers in the profits of enterprises and protect the wage and the social benefits by safeguards against seizure, to the extent and in the cases specified, together with the other privileges and guarantees provided by the legislation.Section  of the Organic Labour Act:The right to remuneration is unrenounceable and cannot be ceded either as a whole or in part, whether gratuitously or in exchange for services, except to a worker's spouse or a person living with him as his wife, and to their children. It can only be pledged as security in the cases and within the limits defined by the law.Note: Notwithstanding the foregoing, in enterprises employing more than fifty () employees, an employee may request the employer to deduct from his wages or salary single or periodic payments to the trade union of which he is a member; to charitable associations, benevolent societies, or non-profit-making foundations; to cooperatives; or to cultural, artistic or sporting organisations or any others of social interest. The employer shall comply with such requests provided the beneficiaries have fulfilled the legal requirements. The employee may revoke such authorisation at any time.
.Lastly, the Government invites the Committee on Freedom of Association, in its advisory capacity, to state its opinion on the subject of trade union solidarity, for the purpose of determining whether workers who are not unionised are obliged to pay contributions to the union in cases where they are covered by the collective agreement. The Government adds that the Committee's opinion is to be sent to the Supreme Court of Justice, which will decide on the application made by the Attorney-General of the Republic for a ruling declaring the provision in question partly void.
.The Committee takes note with interest of the agreement reached on  February  between the Ministry of Education and seven federations of the teaching profession, whereby the Ministry undertakes to deduct from the pay of workers covered by the collective agreement signed on  March  the regular and special contributions referred to in clause  of the said collective agreement. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that, once the deductions had been effected, the Ministry of Education had been obliged to deposit the sums withheld in a trust account with the",0,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
323,"Central Bank of Venezuela, since the Attorney-General had applied to the Supreme Court of Justice for a ruling declaring void part of the provisions of section  of the Organic Labour Act which authorises the deduction of solidarity contributions (that is, agency shop contributions by reason of benefits derived from collective bargaining) from the pay of workers not members of the unions signatories of the collective agreement. The ruling was requested because, in the Attorney-General's opinion, it is unjust and contrary to the provisions of the Constitution and of statutes concerning the protection and safeguard from seizure of wages to oblige a worker, without his permission or against his will, to make a financial contribution to a union of which he is not a member. The Committee notes furthermore with interest that the Government is asking it to hand down an opinion on these questions, in order that the opinion may be brought to the attention of the Supreme Court of Justice.
.In the cases concerning questions related to trade union security clauses - including those clauses which imply the payment of dues by workers who are not members of trade union organisations signatory of a collective agreement - the Committee takes inspiration from the debates that took place during the International Labour Conference, when adopting the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.On that occasion, the Committee on International Relations of the Conference, taking into consideration the debate which it had held on the issue of union security clauses finally agreed to express in the report its view that the Convention could in no way be interpreted as authorising or prohibiting union security arrangements, such matters being matters for regulation in accordance with national practice. (See st Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Peru), para. , which cites the Record of Proceedings, International Labour Conference, nd Session, , p. .)
.Taking into consideration this declaration, the Committee considers that problems related to union security clauses should be resolved at the national level, in conformity with national practice and the industrial relations system in each country. In other words, both situations where union security clauses are authorised and those where these are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Basing itself on the debates that took place at the International Labour Conference during the adoption of Convention No. , the Committee considers that both situations where union security clauses are authorised and those where they are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association.",0,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
324,".The General Confederation of Workers (CGT) submitted a complaint alleging the violation of freedom of association in a communication of  April . The Government sent its observations in a communcation of  January .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April , the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) states that on  November  the Ministry of Labour, after verifying that the Single Trade Union of Sales and Distribution Workers of the Cevecera Polar del Lago C.A. enterprise (in Zulia) had complied with statutory requirements, approved the registration of this organisation in the register of trade unions, which was subsequently carried out.
.The complainant organisation adds that the Cervecera Polar del Lago C.A. enterprise filed an appeal against the administrative act which had authorised the registration of the trade union organisation; on  January , without having given the trade union the opportunity to present its arguments against this appeal, the Ministry of Labour (Administrative Appeals Branch) concluded that the workers who made up this organisation and who had requested its registration as a trade union organisation, were not employed within the enterprise, and therefore declared null and void the administrative act of the General Sectoral Labour Directorate (Trade Unions Branch), thereby overturning the ruling of  November , and rescinding the organisation's registration in the Zulia Labour Inspectorate's register of trade unions.
.The complainant organisation concludes by stating that the enterprise has dismissed  workers since the Ministry of Labour revoked the trade union's registration.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the Labour Inspection Service having jurisdiction in the State of Zulia did in fact, on  November , certify the Single Trade Union of Sales and Distribution Workers of the Cervecera Polar del Lago C.A. enterprise, and that the enterprise then filed an appeal before the General Sectoral Labour Directorate, alleging that the promoters of this trade union organisation were not employees of the enterprise, which is an essential requirement for the trade union's legality; this came about because the Labour Inspection Service did not notify the enterprise before making its decision, thereby failing to comply with the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act and the Labour Act. According to the enterprise, whose statements are confirmed by the corresponding official documents, the group of individuals in question had a commercial relationship with the enterprise, as evidenced by the fact that it was duly registered in the government registry of commercial concerns; therefore, their relationship with the enterprise was commercial in nature, and did not involve natural persons or contracts of employment.
.The Government adds that both Venezuelan doctrine and jurisprudence have established the following criteria for determining whether an employment relationship exists: () a service must be rendered; () remuneration must be paid; and () there must be a state of subordination or dependency. The first requirement is subject to orders and instructions given by the employer as regards the performance of tasks inherent in the service rendered, but the workers who promoted the trade union organisation in question do not work in the enterprise, and therefore do not render services. What binds the parties is a concession agreement, whose clauses define obligations which may be performed by a third party; this further contradicts one of the characteristics of employment relationships - intuitu personae. Another fact which supports the absence of an employment relationship between the so-called trade union organisation and the enterprise is that they are merchants; they do not receive wages, but earn profits from the sale of products (beer and malts) which they acquire by means of cash payments. Their earnings depend exclusively on the efforts they devote to placing their merchandise with the clients in the zone or route specified in the concession agreement. There is no subordination or legal dependency between the parties; instead, what binds them is a concession agreement which defines the zone or route which is exclusively reserved to the person signing the agreement; the parties are also bound not to enter into concession agreements with other sales agents or concessionaires, unless otherwise stipulated in the agreement.
.The Government concludes that from this perspective the relationship between the parties is governed by a purchase/sale contract under which one of the parties sells beer and malts to the other, who in turn distributes the product in specified areas, agreeing by means of the concession agreement to purchase the product at a given price. The concessionaire distributes the beer and malt he has purchased, and sells them at his own risk and account, with his own vehicle (truck), using drivers or helpers he has hired; this shows that the concessionaire is not bound to the enterprise by an employment relationship, since he is responsible for his own profits and losses.
.The Government encloses the jurisprudence of labour courts, a copy of a decision taken by the Ministry of Labour which overturns the ruling which legalised the trade union, on the grounds that the persons who make up the Single Trade Union of Sales and Distribution Workers of the Cervecera Polar del Lago C.A. enterprise in the State of Zulia are not employees of the enterprise, as well as a copy of decisions which confirm the decision of the Ministry. The Government concludes that the legal relationship between the company and the concessionaires who make up the Single Trade Union of Sales and Distribution Workers of the Cervecera Polar del Lago C.A. enterprise is commercial in nature; in accordance with Venezuelan labour jurisprudence, it is not possible to legalise trade union organisations of beer and malt distributors since their relationship is purely commercial, as defined in section  of the Code of Commerce, which establishes the obligations and relations between merchants. For these reasons the Government considers that there has been no violation of freedom of association.
.The Committee notes that the allegations presented by the complainant organisation refer, on the one hand, to the Ministry of Labour's decision to annul its earlier registration of the Single Trade Union of Sales and Distribution Workers of the Cervecera Polar del Lago enterprise (in Zulia) at the request of the company, and the subsequent dismissal of  workers from this enterprise.
.As regards the registration of the trade union organisation known as ""Single Trade Union of Sales and Distribution Workers of Cervecera Polar del Lago"", issued by the Ministry of Labour, and the subsequent annulment of this administrative act by the Administrative Appeals Branch of the same Ministry, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Cervecera Polar del Lago C.A. filed review proceedings alleging that the promoters of this trade union organisation were not workers in the enterprise, which is an indispensable requirement for the legal constitution of a trade union, and that these individuals are bound to the enterprise by means of a concession agreement, adding that the nature of the legal relationship between the concessionaires and the enterprise is a commercial one, and that in accordance with labour jurisprudence, it is not possible to recognise the trade union organisation of the distributors in question, owing to the fact that the relationship is purely commercial.
.In this connection the Committee points out that it does not have the competence to express an opinion concerning the legal relationship (labour or commercial) between the distributors and sales agents concerned and the Cervecera Polar del Lago enterprise. It notes that, according to the Government's statements, the absence of an employment relationship implies that these workers are not covered by the provisions of the Labour Act and that they cannot therefore establish a trade union. It therefore requests the Government to supply information on the type of organisations that sales and distribution workers could establish, and to indicate the texts and procedures under which these organisations could be established and the activities that they could undertake.
.In these conditions, the Committee emphasises that Convention No.  permits the exclusion only of the armed forces and the police, and therefore, that persons engaged in the distribution and sale of beer should be able to set up organisations of their choice (Convention No. , Article ).
.As regards the  workers dismissed by the Cervecera del Lago enterprise, the Committee notes that the Government has not replied to these allegations. It therefore requests the Government to make its observations in this respect, indicating which workers were dismissed, their functions in the enterprise and the grounds upon which these measures were taken. The Committee also requests the complainant organisation to make any further comments that it may wish to add on this matter.
.In the light of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the type of organisations that sales and distribution workers could establish, and to indicate the texts and procedures under which these organisations could be established and",0,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
325,"the activities that they could undertake.(b) The Committee requests the Government to indicate the status of the  workers from the Cervecera del Lago C.A. enterprise who were dismissed, their functions in the enterprise and the grounds upon which these measures were taken.(c) The Committee also requests the complainant organisation to make any further comments that it may wish to add on this matter.",1,1991,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
326,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Venezuelan General Confederation of Labour (CGT) dated  April . The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) supported this complaint in a communication dated  April . The Government replied in a communication dated  October .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  April , the Venezuelan General Confederation of Labour (CGT) alleges that on  January , an indefinite strike was called by more than  drivers of heavy vehicles, belonging to the Occupational Trade Union of Drivers of Heavy Vehicles and Related Trades of the State of Bolivar (SUCHOGAND-BOLIVAR). These drivers work for  private haulage companies, which are franchise holders of the Orinoco Iron and Steel Corporation (SIDOR). The CGT adds that the strike called for the restoration of working conditions that had been altered by an illegal alleged collective agreement. This agreement, signed without the consent or the authorisation of the workers by an unlawful executive committee (five of the seven members of that committee had been dubiously replaced in April ), in collusion with the employers, had been declared lawful by the Labour Inspectorate in spite of workers' protests. More specifically, the strike set out to restore the system whereby  per cent of the net transport load was reimbursed to the workers - a system that had been in force for more than  years in the branch of activity under consideration; the above-mentioned collective agreement (the deposit of which had been accepted by the Ministry of Labour) replaced this system by a wage scale.
.The CGT points out that on  December  SUCHOGAND-BOLIVAR appointed a new lawful executive committee and dismissed the previous officials; but the Ministry of Labour and the employers refused to recognise it.
.The CGT adds that the Government's response to the strike launched on  January  was to issue Decree No.  of  March  which, in violation of Conventions Nos.  and , ordered a return to work and subjected the dispute to compulsory arbitration.
.The Government states that the drivers working for the haulage companies of the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana (CVG) and the Orinoco Iron and Steel Corporation (SIDOR) have not been working since  January  and that the Ministry of Labour intervened in this dispute, proposing a compromise, but the parties failed to reach an agreement. As the Venezuelan economy could not tolerate a labour dispute that caused considerable losses to a fundamental state enterprise, with all the obvious harmful repercussions this had on the economic life of the country and its population, the National Executive, under Decree No.  of  March , ordered that work should be resumed under the same conditions existing before it came to a standstill and submitted the dispute to an arbitration board - with the proviso that, if either of the parties failed to appoint representatives within five days of the Decree having been issued, the Ministry of Labour would appoint them ex officio. The Government adds that on  March , the Ministry of Labour, under Order No. , appointed the workers' representative on the arbitration board ex officio, as the workers had submitted two different candidates, thereby creating a conflict of representativity and legitimacy.
.The Government states that on  March , the Occupational Trade Union of Drivers of Heavy Vehicles and Related Trades of the State of Bolivar, the Autonomous National Federation of Drivers' Trade Unions, the Venezuelan Central of Workers and the Venezuelan General Confederation of Labour submitted an application to the Politico-administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, seeking both a writ for amparo (enforcement of constitutional rights), and a judicial review of administrative decisions that had been handed down, namely the Presidential Decree No.  of  March  and the Order No.  issued by the Ministry of Labour on  March . In a decision of  April , the Supreme Court of Justice informed the applicants that, according to section  of the fundamental law of amparo on constitutional rights and guarantees, two items were missing from their file: the name of the union's representative and the authorisation to exercise the corresponding action for amparo. They were asked to repair this oversight within  hours. It could only be inferred from the minutes of  March  that there had in fact been a vote and that one representative (for the workers) had been appointed to the arbitration board, but the list of proposed workers was not attached to these minutes. On  June  the Court declared irreceivable the writ for amparo submitted by Ernesto Rodrguez, who claimed to be Secretary-General of the trade union, and Pedro Len Trujillo, President of the CGT, because the court deduced from the documents on file that there was a legitimacy conflict within the trade union, since two different executives claimed to be representative. The court stipulated that the writ for amparo submitted refers to freedom of association, trade union democracy and the sovereignty of workers; consequently, ""whoever claims such rights have been infringed must, obviously, be the representatives of the wronged trade union organisation"". The Supreme Court of Justice considered that the conflict referred to in the ruling did indeed exist and that, as a result, ""making a pronouncement in this case would imply the recognition of the legitimacy of those submitting a writ for amparo""; ""it would therefore be inacceptable that the request for amparo should, either directly or indirectly, be used to determine who is the holder of a right, because the ruling handed down would be a component of this same right; since it is well known that this type of ruling must only be handed down with caution and merely state that there has been an infringement of constitutional rights and order that amendments be made"".
.The Committee notes that from the allegations and the Government's reply, it appears that the Occupational Trade Union of Drivers of Heavy Vehicles and Related Trades of the State of Bolivar (SUCHOGAND-BOLIVAR) has two executive committees both of which claim that they are lawful and that the executive recognised by the Ministry of Labour - at least as regards the collective agreement - is precisely the one disclaimed by the complainant organisation. According to the latter, the Ministry of Labour authorised a collective agreement that was detrimental to the workers, concluded between the unlawful executive committee and the transport enterprises working for the SIDOR enterprise, and refuses to recognise the lawful executive committee. The complainant organisation considers that Decree No.  of  March , which put an end to the strike declared on  January  by drivers who wanted a restoration of their wages system that had been altered by the illegal collective agreement, infringes the Conventions relating to freedom of association. On the whole, the Committee notes that the alleged events originated in the context of rivalry between sectors of the same trade union. It requests the Government to ensure that disputes within a trade union are resolved by a vote by the workers so that they themselves can elect the representatives of their own choosing.
.As regards Decree No.  of  March  which ordered the drivers of heavy vehicles (on strike since  January ) to return to work and subjected the dispute to compulsory arbitration, the Committee notes that the Government justifies this Decree on the grounds of the losses incurred by the Orinoco Iron and Steel Corporation and the harmful repercussions on the economic life of the country. However, at no time does the Government state that the strike in question failed to comply with the legal requirements or had repercussions on the life, personal safety or health of the population. Furthermore, the Government did not deny that the strike organised by the lawful executive committee (lawful from the standpoint of the complainant organisation) was called for reasons related to work, namely to restore wage conditions that had been in force until the unlawful executive committee (unlawful from the standpoint of the complainant organisation) signed an alleged illegal collective agreement detrimental to the workers (by substituting a wage scale for the system whereby  per cent of the net transport load was reimbursed to workers, a system in force for more than  years).
.In these circumstances, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle it has always upheld, to the effect that: ""the substitution by legislative means of compulsory arbitration for the right to strike as a means of resolving labour disputes can only be justified in respect of essential services in the strict sense of the term (i.e. those services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population); apart from such cases, it would be contrary to the right of workers' organisations to organise their activities",0,1990,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
327,"and formulate their programmes."" (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ; see also th and th Report, Case No.  (Colombia), paras.  and , respectively.) Given that in this case haulage services in the iron and steel sector are not included within the above-mentioned concept of essential services and, furthermore, that the strike only affected some drivers, the Committee must express its regret that the Government adopted Decree No.  to submit the dispute of the drivers of heavy vehicles on strike to compulsory arbitration. It requests the Government to take measures to ensure that, in the future, compulsory arbitration will only be used with respect to essential services in the strict sense of the term.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)The Committee requests the Government to ensure that disputes within a trade union are resolved by a vote by the workers so that they themselves can elect the representatives of their own choosing.(b)The Committee regrets that the Government adopted Decree No.  to submit the dispute of the drivers of heavy vehicles on strike to compulsory arbitration and requests it to take measures to ensure that, in the future, compulsory arbitration will only be used with respect to essential services in the strict sense of the term.",-1,1990,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In this case the allegations concerned anti-trade union reprisals taken against four trade union officials of the National Federation of Workers of the International Bank (FETRABIN) following a two-hour demonstration to protest against the Bank unilaterally imposing continuous working hours. The employer, considering that this demonstration was tantamount to an illegal strike accompanied by acts of violence, asked the Labour Inspectorate to authorise the dismissal of the trade union officials in question. The Committee noted from the vast amount of documentation placed at the Committee's disposal, both by the complainant and by the Government, that it was apparent that, in the beginning, the dismissal of the trade union officials was agreed to by the Labour Inspectorate. Later, after those concerned had lodged an appeal to quash the administrative decision, the courts decided on the temporary suspension of the dismissals and ordered the reinstatement of the trade union officials until such time as the administrative court had handed down its ruling. However, this decision was badly accepted by the employer who, when reinstating the trade union officials in question, subjected them to poor working conditions - which was attested to by an inspection visit (see th Report, para. ).
.The Committee made the following recommendatiions on these allegations (see th Report, para. ):(a) as regards the dismissal of trade union officials following a trade union demonstration, the Committee notes that an appeal has been launched with the administrative court and requests the Government to communicate to it the text of the final ruling of the Court with its reasons adduced when it is handed down;(b) as regards the poor working conditions inflicted by the employer on the reinstated trade union officials which were noted by a labour inspection visit, the Committee recalls that workers, especially trade union officials, should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of discrimination in respect of freedom of association in employment. It requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this situation; and(c) as for the unilateral decision to change the work schedule taken by the International Bank Limited, the Committee recalls the importance it attaches to the right of workers to participate in the determination of their working conditions through collective bargaining. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken or envisaged to ensure that this principle is respected in the present case.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that the administrative court has not yet handed down a ruling on the appeal concerning the dismissal (at present suspended) of the FETRABIN officials. As regards the complaints concerning the poor working conditions inflicted by the employer on the reinstated trade union officials, the Government reports that on the basis of an inspection carried out on  May , it noted that the premises had been changed and air-conditioned to comply with the orders issued by the inspector after an inspection on  August  and that the layout had been altered. Finally, the Government notes that the International Bank has withdrawn its unilateral decision to change the work schedule; consequently, the workers work at present according to the schedule stipulated in their collective agreement.
.The Committee notes with interest that the International Bank has withdrawn its unilateral decision to change the work schedule, with the result that the workers now follow the timetable stipulated in the collective agreement, and that the above-mentioned Bank has complied with the recommendations from the Labour Inspectorate to put an end to the unhealthy conditions inflicted upon FETRABIN officials at their workplace.
.In addition, the Committee notes that the administrative court has not yet handed down a ruling on the appeal concerning the dismissal (at present suspended) of the FETRABIN officials and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this appeal.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) the Committee notes with interest that the problems concerning the unilateral decision to change the work schedule at the International Bank and the unhealthy working conditions inflicted on FETRABIN officials have been resolved; and(b) the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal before the administrative court concerning the dismissal (at present suspended by the Court) of FETRABIN officials.
.The National Federation of Workers of the International Bank Limited (FETRABIN) submitted a complaint of violation of trade union rights against the Government of Venezuela in a communication dated  June . Subsequently, it sent additional documentation on this issue in a communication dated  July . The Government sent its comments and observations in a communication dated  January .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their complaint, the members of the FETRABIN executive denounced trade union reprisals against a number of officials of the Federation and members of its executive. They state that they are speaking on their own behalf and on behalf of the , workers employed by the International Bank they represent and accuse this same bank and the competent authorities of the Ministry of Labour, in this case the Labour Inspectorate in the federal district Municipio Libertador, of having infringed freedom of association.
.The complainant explains that on  November , between . a.m. and . p.m., the Federation, through its executive made up of four duly appointed trade union officials - the President of FETRABIN, Luis Albert Perez, the Secretary-General, Ignacio Abello, the Financial Secretary, Maritza Torrealba, and the Secretary in charge of supervision and discipline, Manuel Capote Avarado - carried out a peaceful protest demonstration together with other trade union representatives in the banking sector, on the grounds that the employer, in a unilateral and illegal way, had imposed continuous working hours on workers in contact with the public, more especially cashiers. However, according to the complainant, matters such as the minimum conditions of pay for these continuous working hours and the meal allowance should have been decided upon in consultation with them because the work schedule in question was not legally authorised by the Labour Inspectorate. The complainant adds that the peaceful protest demonstration was held in front of the gates and outside the International Bank Limited.
.Subsequently, it explains, the International Bank requested the Labour Inspectorate for authorisation to dismiss the trade union officials. It is the only bank to have made this request although similar protest demonstrations were held in front of other banks where the employers did not take any action against the trade union organisations or workers. Furthermore - and this is even more serious - a body under the Ministry of Labour decided to grant authorisation for dismissal, basing its decision on incorrect information on actions attributed to members of the Federation's executive.
.The complainant points out that the demand for authorisation of dismissal was based on section (e), (f) and (h) of the Labour Code, which states that serious breaches of obligations imposed upon workers by the contract of employment, gross lack of respect and consideration due to the employer and abandonment of work constitute grounds for termination of the contract. It encloses, as an annex to its complaint, a copy of the file submitted by the employer to the Labour Inspectorate; as the four trade union officials in question benefited from trade union immunity, as stipulated in section  of the Labour Code, authorisation for their dismissal was required from the Labour Inspector (regulation made under the Labour Code - section ). They also enclose the copy of the defence statement submitted by their own lawyer.
.According to the complainant, the request for authorisation for dismissal was based on erroneous, even serious, grounds, since the employer claimed that ""the doors of the safes had been broken"" and that ""the members of the Federation's executive had offended the two Vice-Presidents of the bank in question in an obscene and crude way"". The complainant adds that witnesses from both the employers' side and the workers' side have stated that the acts attributed to the trade union officials are groundless. Consequently, the request for authorisation for dismissal was not in accordance with the law because it has been proven that the trade union officials in question were not guilty of a serious breach of obligations imposed upon them by the contract of employment, gross lack of respect due to the employer or, even less, of having abandoned their work.
.Indeed, the workers had orally requested authorisation for absence for trade union reasons,",0,1989,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
329,"given that the collective agreement concluded between the National Federation and the International Bank did not stipulate that requests should be drafted in writing. Clause No.  of the collective agreement in force concerning authorisations of absence for trade union reasons merely stipulates that requests must be submitted two hours in advance and that absences granted must be devoted to dealing with workers' problems with the bank or with the competent labour authorities.
.The complainant requests the Committee to analyse the procedure carried out before the Labour Inspectorate which, it claims, is illegal because of technical flaws and based on false allegations made against trade union officials. The administrative procedure constituted a flagrant denial of justice, was contrary to the law and dealt a serious blow to trade unionism, infringing the Constitution, the Labour Code, the regulations made under the Labour Code and the international labour Conventions in force in Venezuela.
.In concluding, the complainant requests that the ILO should intervene to put an end to these illegal, unconstitutional and arbitrary measures that have caused damage that might be irreparable to the trade union movement.
.In a subsequent communication dated  July , the complainant provides a vast amount of documentation relating to developments in this case, including the appeal to quash the act of authorisation for dismissal, the temporary injunction, reinstating the dismissed trade union officials and the copy of the judicial inspection carried out at the workplace of the reinstated workers.
.In its communication of  January , the Government acknowledges that on  May , at the request of the International Bank Limited involved in this case, the Labour Inspector of the federal district - Libertador Department - found the behaviour of Luis Perrez, Ignacio Abello, Maritza Torrealba and Manuel Capote, members of the FETRABIN executive, at fault.
.The Government explains that the FETRABIN then brought an appeal before the court of the first instance of the competent administrative jurisdiction to quash the administrative ruling in question.
.At the same time, the FETRABIN sought a writ for amparo (enforcement of constitutional rights) before the labour court of the first instance in the federal district and the district of Sucre in the State of Miranda, demanding that the legal repercussions of the labour inspector's order declaring the trade union officials at fault be suspended. This suspension was granted and accompanied by an order to reinstate the trade union officials until the court had made a final ruling on the merits of the case. Meanwhile, the International Bank Limited appealed against the decision to suspend the administrative act, but this appeal was rejected both by the lower and the higher court - first by the judge on  June  and then by the Public Prosecutor on  July .
.Furthermore, on  July , FETRABIN submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Labour that the reinstatement of the trade unionists had taken place in circumstances contrary to basic standards of occupational safety and health. On  July , the Minister of Labour therefore requested the Social Security Department to carry out an inspection of the bank premises to check the validity of the complaint. The complainant had particularly denounced the fact that since they had been reinstated following a legal ruling, they had been put in the basement of the building in an unhealthy area where they could not work. The complainant requested that the Vice-President of the bank in charge of personnel who had shown his disapproval of the reinstatement order issued by the court of the first instance on  July  and assigned those concerned to this unhealthy area, should be penalised.
.The visit of inspection, in the presence of the signatories to the complaint, was carried out on  August . The inspector noted that the trade unionists reinstated in the enterprise were placed in areas isolated from the rest of the enterprise and their colleagues, and that they were considerably bothered by the noise and dust from the building's ventilation system. These conditions prevented them from concentrating on their work. Furthermore, the fire extinguishers and electrical equipment in the premises where they were working were not in accordance with required standards and the exit signs in the case of an emergency were incorrect.
.In concluding, the Government considers that this case should not call for further examination by the Committee. It is of the opinion that the administrative court will make its final ruling on this case, fully guaranteeing that the proceedings are fair. Furthermore, the temporary injunction, suspending the administrative decision authorising dismissal handed down by the labour courts, in accordance with the legislation on constitutional rights and guarantees, has prevented the workers from repercussions that might have been irreparable - until the court's final decision is pronounced.
.The Committee notes that in this case the allegations concern anti-trade union reprisals against four trade union officials of the National Federation of Workers of the International Bank (FETRABIN), following a two-hour demonstration to protest against the bank unilaterally imposing continuous working hours. The employer, considering that this demonstration was tantamount to an illegal strike accompanied by acts of violence, asked the Labour Inspectorate to authorise the dismissal of the trade union officials in question. From the vast amount of documentation placed at the Committee's disposal, both by the complainant and by the Government, it is apparent that, in the beginning, the dismissal of the trade union officials was accepted by the Labour Inspectorate. Later, after those concerned had lodged an appeal to quash the administrative decision, the courts decided on the temporary suspension of the dismissals and ordered the reinstatement of the trade union officials until such a time as the administrative court had handed down its ruling. However, this decision was badly accepted by the employer who, when reinstating the trade union officials in question, subjected them to poor working conditions - which was attested to by an inspection visit.
.Given these various factors, the Committee feels bound to recall generally that: () the right to strike is one of the essential means which workers and their organisations should have for the promotion and defence of their occupational interests; () no one should be prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of his or her legitimate trade union activities; () the guarantee of the free exercise of trade union rights should be accompanied by measures which include the protection of workers against anti-union discrimination in their employment; and () workers should be able to participate in the determination of their employment conditions with their employer.
.The Committee notes that an appeal to quash the administrative ruling of the Labour Inspector authorising their dismissal was lodged by the trade union officials. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the text of the final ruling of the court with the reasons adduced when it is handed down.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that even the Government is of the opinion that the reinstatement of the trade union officials, carried out under a temporary court injunction, was accepted by the employer, the latter nevertheless inflicted poor working conditions on those concerned. On this point, the Committee recalls that one of the basic principles of freedom of association is that workers, especially trade union officials, should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of discrimination which might infringe their freedom of association in respect of their employment. The Committee notes that an inspection was made and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.Finally, as regards the unilateral decision to change the work schedule at the International Bank Limited, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the importance it attaches to the right of workers to participate in the determination of their working conditions through collective bargaining. It therefore requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken or envisaged to ensure the respect of this principle in the present case.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the dismissal of trade union officials following a trade union demonstration, the Committee notes that an appeal has been lodged with the administrative court and requests the Government to communicate to it the text of the final ruling of the court with its reasons adduced when it is handed down.(b) As regards the poor working conditions inflicted by the employer on the reinstated trade union officials which were noted by a labour inspection visit, the Committee recalls that workers, especially trade union officials, should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of discrimination in respect of freedom of association in employment. It requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this situation.(c) As for the unilateral decision to change the work schedule taken by the International Bank Limited, the Committee recalls the importance it attaches to the right of workers to participate in the determination of their working conditions through collective bargaining. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken or envisaged to ensure that this",-1,1989,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

331,".The United Trade Union of Teachers of the National Institute for Educational Co-operation for the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SUTDI) presented a complaint alleging the violation of freedom of association against the Government of Venezuela in communications of  January and  March . The Government sent its observations in a communication of  May  and  January .
.At its meeting of November , the Committee adjourned its examination of the case pending ""the Government's transmission of a copy of the judgement to be handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the registration of the United Trade Union of Teachers of the National Institute for Education Co-operation (INCE)"" (see th Report, para. ), which was the issue in the present case.
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The United Trade Union of Teachers of the National Institute for Educational Co-operation for the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SUTDI), states in its communication of  January  that the trade union was legally recognised on  February  by the Labour Inspectorate and confirmed by two decisions issued by the Ministry of Labour. On  October  the President of the National Institute for Educational Co-operation (INCE), a government agency, requested the Supreme Court of Justice to overturn the granting of legal recognition to the SUTDI.
.The complainant states that the INCE's request for the withdrawal of legal recognition is the latest in a series of measures taken by the INCE management to curtail freedom of association, notwithstanding Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Venezuela, and the provisions of the Education Act which protect teachers and the National Constitution itself. The SUTDI adds that during a period of two years the INCE management has violated the trade union rights of INCE teachers with impunity, going so far as to refuse to abide by a judicial decision handed down on  November  in which the second chamber of the Labour Court of First Instance ordered the INCE to abide by constitutional principles.
.In its communication of  March  the SUTDI encloses copies of documents issued by the Ministry of Labour which dismissed the allegations presented by the INCE in support of its request for the withdrawal of legal recognition of the SUTDI. The communication notes that the Ministry of Labour emphasised that the dismantling of this trade union organisation would infringe the principles of Conventions Nos.  and . Moreover, the SUTDI encloses copies of supporting documentation submitted by the trade union to the Ministry of Labour, and of records of the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the proceedings filed to seek the withdrawal of legal recognition granted to the SUTDI.
.The documentation submitted by the complainant suggests that the INCE refuses to recognise the trade union privileges of trade union officers and delegates on the grounds that the trade union is illegal, that it does not deduct trade union dues and that it refuses to reply to trade union requests and petitions. The INCE's legal action seeking the withdrawal of the recognition granted to the trade union by the Ministry of Labour, is based on its contention that teachers who are public servants, and in particular those who belong to the INCE, are subject to the Administrative Career Act (and not to the Education Act). This would mean that they have the right to establish trade unions in accordance with the terms and conditions of said Act and the Regulation concerning the trade unions of public servants, but are not entitled to enter into collective agreements.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that in compliance with the writ issued for constitutional protection (amparo in Spanish) of the United Trade Union of Teachers of the National Institute for Educational Co-operation for the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SUTDI), handed down by the second chamber of the Labour Court of First Instance of the Federal District and the State of Miranda on  November , the National Institute for Educational Co-operation (INCE) took the following steps: it convened a meeting on  January  which was attended by high officials of both parties; the Minutes of the meeting reflect the agreements reached there, and specifically that the deduction of trade union dues would become effective as from  January , and that subsequent meetings would address issues concerning the trade union privileges of union officials and delegates. It was also agreed at the meeting and by means of subsequent communications that the INCE would comply with its obligations to answer correspondence received from the trade union.
.The Government states that the trade union in question enjoys full freedom in dealing without restrictions with workers both in Caracas and in other provinces, and in expressing its opinions through its ordinary media agencies and the national press. It reiterates that the INCE is respecting the constitutional provisions concerning freedom of association and the right of trade unions to file petitions.
.The Government adds that, according to the INCE, the members of the trade union are considered to be public servants. It was for this reason the INCE had requested the withdrawal of the legal recognition granted to the trade union by the Ministry of Labour, on the grounds that the request for legal recognition should have been filed before the Central Personnel Office (OCP). In fact, the freedom of association of public servants in Venezuela is governed by the Administrative Career Act and its Regulation; these legal instruments establish that applications for the granting of legal recognition of public servants' trade unions should be filed with the OCP, which is part of the Office of the President of the Republic.
.The Government states that the Supreme Court of Justice is currently considering this case and that a judgement is pending. However, it should be noted that on  March  the Supreme Court denied the INCE's request for the temporary suspension of the Ministry of Labour's legal recognition of the SUTDI. The Government encloses a copy of a judgement, orders and agreements concerning the present case.
.In its communication of  January  the Government reiterates that the case is still before the Supreme Court of Justice, that a judgement is pending and that a Magistrate of the Administrative Policy Chamber was appointed in November of last year. The judgement will be respected and forwarded in due course to the Committee. The Government states that the Independent Institute for Educational Co-operation (INCE), which is a legal entity separate from the National Treasury, challenged the registration and consequent legalisation of the United Trade Union of Teachers of the INCE for the Federal District and the State of Miranda (SUTDI) in the Administrative Policy Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, and requested the suspension of the effects of the administrative issuance which legalised the organisation concerned. This suspension was denied by the Court and the organisation therefore enjoys its full rights pending a judicial decision on the substance of the case. The Government, respectful of the decisions of the judiciary, recognises that this trade union currently enjoys all rights granted by the Constitution and the laws of the Republic, evidence of which is the fact that in October last the trade union called a strike which was protected by the labour authorities and which culminated in bargaining on conditions of work (the Government encloses the corresponding documentation). It notes that the labour authorities and those of the employer institute negotiated with the leaders of the SUTDI union during this strike, and reached agreements concerning the recognition of this organisation by the INCE - including clauses concerning the union - and regarding the conditions of work of its members.
.The present complaint concerns legal proceedings filed by the National Institute for Educational Co-operation (INCE) which seek to obtain the withdrawal of the legal recognition which the United Trade Union of Teachers of the INCE had been granted by the Ministry of Labour. According to the Institute, the reason for these legal proceedings is that the trade union's registration should have been handled through the Central Personnel Office, and not by the Ministry of Labour. According to the documentation made available to the Committee, it is a question of determining whether the juridical scheme applicable to the workers in question rests exclusively on the Administrative Career Act (if so, these workers would be public servants and their trade unions should be registered with the Central Personnel Office), or whether these workers are covered by the Education Act (in which case they would be entitled to set up their trade unions in accordance with the Labour Act and to sign collective agreements, and required to register their trade unions with the Ministry of Labour).
.The Committee notes that this question is currently before the Supreme Court of Justice. It notes with interest that, as pointed",0,1989,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
332,"out in the Government's reply, at present the INCE trade union enjoys full freedom of action, that it has declared a strike and engaged in collective bargaining, and that it has reached agreement with the INCE for the deduction of trade union dues. For its part, the Supreme Court, although it has not yet handed down a judgement, has refused to suspend the administrative act by which the Ministry of Labour registered the trade union in question.
.The Committee notes that the major issue in this case is whether the teachers represented by the SUTDI will enjoy the right to collective bargaining through collective agreements. According to national legislation, the SUTDI would not enjoy the right to collective bargaining if it was governed only by the Administrative Career Act and therefore had to be registered with the Central Personnel Office; however, it would enjoy this right if it came under the Education Act and its current registration with the Ministry of Labour (now being challenged in Court) was recognised as valid. The Committee draws attention to the fact that according to Convention No. , ratified by Venezuela, teachers should not be denied the right to negotiate their terms and conditions of employment through the means of collective agreements (in this connection, see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, third edition, , para. , as well as the Committee's nd Report, Case No.  (Colombia), para. ), and expresses the hope that the Supreme Court's decision will take fully into account the obligations arising from Convention No. .
.The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgement to be handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the registration of the United Trade Union of Teachers of the INCE.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee recalls that in accordance with Convention No. , ratified by Venezuela, teachers should not be denied the right to negotiate their terms and conditions of employment through collective agreements.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgement to be handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the registration of the United Trade Union of Teachers of the INCE.",0,1989,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of theRight to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise andCollective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with interest that the Labour Inspectorate orderedthe reinstatement of the two trade unionists dismissed by the enterprise ""TheDaily Journal C.A."" because of the commencement of collective bargaining bythe National Trade Union of Press Workers. The Committee hopes that thedecision of the Labour Inspectorate will be followed in practice and that itwill receive confirmation that the two workers in question have beenreinstated. The Committee also notes with interest that the administrativeauthority, in the second instance, upheld the order that the above-mentionedenterprise should discuss the collective agreement submitted by the tradeunion.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1988,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
334,".The Committee on Freedom of Association considered this case at its meeting in November  and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see rd Report, paragraphs  to ) which approved the report at its th Session (November ).
.The Government has communicated additional comments dated  February .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  May  the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) alleged that the trade unionists Luis Aquilino Marcano Gamboa, Fredy Marcano, Joel Rodrguez, Juan Vicente Martnez Lpez (officials of the Federation of Free Trade Unions of the State of Monagas), Francelia Barreto and Miguel Angel Salazar Trinitario had been arbitrarily arrested, that their homes had been searched, that the headquarters of the Federation of Free Trade Unions of the State of Monagas had been forcibly entered and that files and the mimeograph machine of the said Federation had been seized. The communication from the WCL added that  days after their arrest the first three of the persons mentioned above had been released, but that all had been brought to trial before a military court on charges of subversion.
.The Government communicated comments on  October  in which it stated that the reason for the arrest of the persons referred to in the complaint was their connection with the clandestine ""Bandera Roja"" (Red Flag) organisation which publicly incites to violence; in addition it stated that the time during which these citizens had been deprived of freedom had not exceeded the statutory period and that during this period they had been placed at the disposal of the competent court, which ordered that some of them should be released and that others should be held in custody. As regards the cases of forcible entry the Government stated that all, without exception, had been preceded by the issue of the appropriate court order and that the objects seized were being held at the disposal of the court dealing with the case. In its communication the Government stressed that the arrests and forcible entries had taken place in conformity with the law, in connection with events that had disturbed the country, owing to the links or relationship of the persons concerned with subversive activities and not by reason of their status as trade unionists, because trade union activities, apart from enjoying the approval of the Government, are protected and supported by the legal situation in force in Venezuela.
.At its previous examination of the case (November ) the Committee invited the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation: while noting that three of the six trade unionists (Luis Aquilino Marcano Gamboa, Fredy Marcano and Joel Rodrguez), who had been arrested, have been released, the Committee requests the Government to indicate the actual events which prompted the arrest, house search and trial of each of the six trade unionists, to provide information on the developments in the corresponding trial, and to give the exact reasons for the raiding of the headquarters of the Federation of Free Trade Unions of the State of Monagas and the confiscation of its property.
.In its communication dated  February  the Government provided further information according to which Juan Vicente Martnez Lpez, Miguel Angel Salazar Trinitario and Francelia Barreto were arrested and placed on trial pursuant to an order made ex officio by the Standing Military Court of First Instance at Bolvar City on  May . The offence charged was that of armed rebellion within the meaning of article () of the Code of Military Justice.
.The communication adds that the proceedings took place as follows: on  May  the investigating court made an order for the institution of proceedings; on  May  the persons concerned entered an appeal, leave to appeal being confirmed by an order made by the Permanent Court Martial in pursuance of article () of the Code of Military Justice. On  June , by Decree No. , the President of the Republic, in the exercise of his special statutory powers, ordered a stay of proceedings in the case of Francelia Barreto; on  September  the file was referred to the Rapporteur for the purposes specified in article  of the Code of Military Justice, that is, for a thorough verification of the orders, the lawfulness of their terms and definition of the acts charged; on  October  the examining judge, by express order, declared the indictment procedure completed, as prescribed in article  of the said Code.
.The Government's communication adds that in conformity with the legislative provisions applicable in this jurisdiction the file was referred to the President of the Republic for his ruling as to whether the proceedings should or should not be continued; in due course the President made a ruling directing that the trial should continue, and the trial is therefore now proceeding and has reached the stage of the swearing in of counsel for the defence. The case is at present being dealt with by the Permanent Court Martial in the city of Maturin in the State of Monagas.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that the judicial proceedings against the trade unionists Juan Vicente Martnez Lpez, Miguel Angel Salazar Trinitario and Francelia Barreto were instituted ex officio in the Standing Military Court of First Instance at Bolvar City on  May , the offence charged being that of armed rebellion under the terms of article () of the Code of Military Justice.
.The Committee also notes that the President of the Republic ordered a stay of proceedings (discontinuance of the indictment procedure) in the case of Francelia Barreto, and also understands from the Government's comments that the other trade unionists referred to in the complaint, viz. Luis Aquilino Marcano Gamboa, Fredy Marcano and Joel Rodrguez, had been released by the competent court within the time-limits prescribed by law.
.The Committee notes, moreover, that on  October  the examining judge declared the investigation procedure completed and, in conformity with the statutory provisions applicable to that jurisdiction, referred the file to the President of the Republic, who made a ruling directing that the trial should continue; it notes that the case is now being dealt with by the Permanent Court Martial in the city of Maturin (State of Monagas).
.From the particulars provided by the Government, the Committee understands that, after the preliminary investigation procedure had been declared completed, the only persons remaining on trial were the trade unionists Miguel Angel Salazar Trinitario and Juan Vicente Martnez Lpez charged with the offence of armed rebellion under the terms of article () of the Code of Military Justice. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall that, in cases where proceedings have been instituted against persons on grounds unconnected with the exercise of trade union rights, it has invariably stressed that the matter is outside its competence; however, it has emphasised that the question whether such a matter is within the scope of the penal law or concerns the exercise of trade union rights is not one that can be resolved unilaterally by the government concerned, but that it is within the Committee's authority to express an opinion on the matter in the light of its consideration of all the available information and, above all, of the court decision.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:While noting the further information provided by the Government, the Committee requests the Government to supply information on developments in the judicial proceedings being conducted in the military jurisdiction against the accused trade unionists, in particular to transmit a copy of the text of the decisions and the reasoning when they are rendered.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Confederation of Labour dated  June . The Government replied in a communicated dated  October .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) alleges that on  May , the Venezuelan authorities arbitrarily arrested Luis Aquilino Marcano Gamboa, Fredy Marcano, Joel Rodrguez, Juan Vicente Martinez Lopez (officials of the Federation of Free Trade Unions of the State of Monagas), Francelia Teresa Barreto and Miguel Angel Salazar Trinitario (trade unionists), and searched their homes.
.The WCL adds that  days after their arrest, the first three persons were released, but that all are being tried by a military court accused of ""subversion"", without grounds.
.The WCL also alleges that on  May , the headquarters of the Federation of Free Trade Unions of the State of Monagas was raided by the authorities, who confiscated the posters for the Fourth Congress, on the grounds that they were subversive, and other posters in the files concerning the former Haitian dictatorship, illustrated by a policeman striking a working-class woman, and the photocopier",0,1987,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
335,"of the organisation.
.The Government states that the arrest of the persons mentioned in the complaint was due to their links, fully proven, to the ""Bandera Roja"" group, which is a clandestine organisation publically instigating armed conflict in the country. Similarly, the deprivation of liberty of some citizens in no way exceeded the time period established by law, within which they appeared before the competent court, which decided that some of them should be released and others remain in custody. In connection with the alleged raids, the Government points out that all, without exception, were preceded by the issue of corresponding judicial warrants and that the objects confiscated at the time for the inquiries are being held at the disposal of the court hearing the case. It adds that those concerned are able to negotiate the return of these objects with the court. All the police activities described took place against the background of events which threw the country into confusion last March, a situation fully reported by the national press. The Government stresses that the arrests and seizures were carried out in accordance with the law during the circumstances and events referred to because of the links or relation of those concerned with subversive activities and not on the grounds of their trade union status because this activity, besides enjoying the blessing of the national Government, is protected and supported by the constitutional state reigning in Venezuela and strictly adhered to by all the national authorities.
.The Committee notes that in the present complaint, the complainant organisation has alleged the arbitrary arrest of six trade unionists (three of whom were later released), the searching of their homes and their trial before a military court accused, without grounds, of subversion, and the raiding of the headquarters of the Federation of Free Trade Unions of the State of Monagas, during which several posters and the photocopier of the organisation were confiscated.
.The Government has pointed out that the arrests, house searches and seizures in question were carried out with all the necessary legal and procedural guarantees. It states that they did not take place because of the trade union status of those concerned, but because of their links with the group ""Bandera Roja"" (a clandestine organisation which is publicly instigating armed conflict in the country) and in connection with their subversive activities, as part of the action undertaken by the authorities during the events which threw the country into confusion in May .
.The Committee takes note of the Government's explanations. Nevertheless, the Committee would emphasise that when complainants allege that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested for trade union activities and the governments' replies are simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, the Committee has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegation (see ""Freedom of Association"", Digest of Decisions and Principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association of the Governing Body, rd Edition, , para. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to indicate the actual events which prompted the arrest, house search and trial of each of the six trade unionists mentioned in the complaint, to provide information on the developments in the corresponding trial, and to give the exact reasons for the raid on the headquarters of the Federation of Free Trade Unions of the State of Monagas and for the confiscation of its property.

.The complainant explains that on  November l the employees of the Central Bank of Venezuela held a general meeting so as to set up a trade union called ""the Independent Union of Employees of the Central Bank of Venezuela""; they drafted rules and elected officers in accordance with current Venezuelan legislation. On  December l they applied to the Ministry of Labour for the granting of legal personality to their union, adding that under section l of the Labour Code the Ministry had two months in which to effect the registration or address to the applicants such observations as might be deemed necessary.
.However, the complainant states, in the present case six months passed without receipt of any reply - which, it says, is a breach of Articles  and  of Convention No.  according to which the acquisition of legal personality by workers' organisations shall not be made subject to requirements of such a nature as to inhibit the application of the Convention and that the law of the land shall not impair, nor be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in the Convention.
.The complainant denounces the overly obliging attitude of the Ministry of Labour towards the Bank's management which is preventing registration of the union and making use of delaying manoeuvres such as bringing the matter before the public prosecutor's office, whereas that office is not competent to decide such questions.
.The complainant demands the immediate registration of the union in conformity with national legislation and the Venezuelan Constitution, which expressly protect the right to associate and respect for Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Venezuela.
.Furthermore, the complainant appends to its complaint a letter dated l May l, which it sent at that time to the employees of all the banks in the country to appeal for the solidarity of other bank employees in the defence of the right of the Central Bank's employees to organise and to bargain collectively. In this appeal, the complainant enumerates the occupational demands of the recently established union, namely: doubling of the grant made when an employee retires on pension; maintenance of the requirement of only one year's seniority for the right to receive housing benefits; abolition of the discrimination existing between salaried employees and wage earners as regards medical benefits; reduction of the unjust workload imposed on the security watchmen, who have to perform police functions outside the immediate area of the Central Bank; and a more proper and equitable distribution of the duties of all the Bank's employees, based on their responsibilities, their seniority, their efforts and the honesty with which they carry out their work.
.In its first reply dated  October l, the Government does not deny that the Minister of Labour has refrained from granting legal personality to the union, but explains that employees of the Central Bank are civil servants and it is not for the Ministry of Labour, but for the Central Personnel Office, to register a union of civil servants, in accordance with the regulations covering public servants' unions.
.Going into more detail, the Government states that on  June l the Ministry of Labour sent back its documents to the union which had proposed to establish itself, considering that in accordance with the Labour Code such a union could not be inscribed in the Register of Trade Unions, since it was composed of civil servants who are subject to the Administrative Careers Act.
.The Government also explains that previously the Ministry of Labour had been competent to register unions of civil servants and that on l November l it had indeed inscribed in the Register of Trade Unions the Union of Public Officials of the Central Bank of Venezuela; however, the registration of civil servants' unions was now within the competence of the Central Personnel Office.
.The Government adds that in any case the complainant has the right to appeal to the courts and that it did indeed make an application to the Administrative Disputes Authority on l October l; this application was held to be receivable by the said Authority on  May l. According to the Government, the relevant proceedings are continuing.
.Furthermore, the Government states that trade unions existing within the Central Bank of Venezuela, particularly the Union of Public Officials of the Central Bank (registered in l), act freely. It adds that the founding members of the Independent Union of Employees of the Central Bank are also members of the Executive Committee of the Union of Public Officials of the Central Bank, and that the union which it is proposed to set up is intended to recruit as members the same type of personnel as already belongs to the Union of Public Officials.
.In a later reply dated  February , the Government adds that in , the Attorney-General had issued a resolution stating that employees of the Central Bank of Venezuela were civil servants as they were employed in the public service. It specifies that Decree No.  of  January , issued under the Administrative Careers Act, establishes the competence of the Central Personnel Office to register public servants' unions; furthermore, under section  of this Decree, it is provided that the Ministry of Labour must refer any documents concerning the registration of these unions to the Office in question. The Government also points out that the appeal to quash the ministerial resolution on this case (resolution of  June , in which the Ministry of Labour stated it was not competent to deal with the matter and returned the documents to the trade union attempting to set itself up) is pending.
.In the opinion of the Committee, the question whether one or another authority is entitled to grant legal personality to a trade union should not infringe the right of workers without distinction whatsoever, including civil servants, to form organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation, as provided in Article  of Convention No. . Nor should the existence of a trade union of public servants in the Central Bank prevent the employees of that establishment from setting up another union for the defence of their interests if they so desire.
.A quite different problem arises when considering which would be the most representative workers' organisation thus entitled to negotiate with the management over the conditions of work of the salaried and wage-earning employees of the Central Bank of Venezuela. In this connection, the Committee recalls that the decision as to which union is the most representative must always be made according to objective, precise and predetermined criteria, so as to preclude any possibility of partiality or abuse.
.Moreover, the existence of a recognised trade union in the Central Bank of Venezuela should not have the result of depriving another union - perhaps not recognised as being the most representative - of the essential means of defending the occupational interests of its members and of the right to organise its administration and activities and to formulate its programme, as laid down in Convention No. .
.In the present case, the Committee regrets the long time taken by the authorities in examining the matter, since the request for legal personality was made by the complainant, the Independent Union of Employees of the Central Bank of Venezuela, to the authorities in December l, more than two years ago. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to accelerate the consideration of the question of the granting of legal personality to the union in question.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to speed up the consideration of the question of the granting of legal personality to the Independent Union of Employees of the Central Bank of Venezuela.b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the action taken to give effect to its recommendations.",0,1987,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
337,".The Union of Pilots of the Venezuelan International Aviation Corporation (OSPV) submitted a complaint of violations of freedom of association on  September . Subsequently, on  January,  February and  May , it provided additional information.
.The Government sent information on the matter in letters dated  April,  May and  and  October  and  February .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The OSPV states that on  July , the Ministry of Labour, acting through a labour inspector, ordered the suspension of the members of the OSPV executive committee, who were also prevented from having access to the premises of the Venezuelan International Aviation Corporation (VIASA). This State Corporation, the complainant adds, employs , persons who are members of one or other of five unions, including the OSPV.
.OSPV states that it is made up of  pilots and is affiliated to the Venezuelan Federation of Professional Air Pilots' Unions and to the Spanish-American Association of Pilots. It explains the facts as follows: VIASA had programmed flights for ,  and  July , but on the th the captain of one aircraft noted that his second-in-command did not hold a certificate of basic training in hangar technique (there is a statutory requirement that this must be obtained afresh every  months); two officers responsible for the supervision of the whole air fleet cancelled the flight with the agreement of the deputy chief pilot, who sent the crew members home because their flight was called off for technical reasons. The complainant explains that the same situation arose for the following flights, which were consequently cancelled by the employer.
.OSPV continues as follows: on  and  July the situation remained unchanged, but on the th, captains of aircraft learned - on the strength of a telegram sent by the Ministry of Transport and Communications to the VIASA Director of Operations on the previous day - that they were relieved of any liability because, in the Ministry's view, failure to possess the certificate in question did not constitute violation of air safety standards. According to the complainant, the telegram had not been immediately sent on to the crews; the pilots, however, obeyed their orders as soon as these were received and - although they did not share the Ministry's view - operations were resumed.
.OSPV explains further that, during the same period, VIASA asked the Ministry of Labour to suspend the members of the Union's executive committee and, on  July , the said Ministry ordered their suspension without giving any justification. OSPV states that in fact VIASA had asked the labour inspector, at  noon on  July, to declare that the stoppage of its normal operations was unlawful and the inspector made this declaration at  p.m. on the same day. OSPV points out that it appealed against the two decisions on  July but the Ministry gave negative decisions. On  July , OSPV informed the Ministry of Labour in writing that it was the Corporation VIASA which had cancelled the flights programmed for the following days. The complainant accordingly considers that the members of its executive committee were wrongfully suspended. It points out that the suspension affected their contractual and their union rights: they could not perform their professional functions as pilots or their union functions as laid down in the Union's regulations and in the collective agreement; discussions on renewal of the agreement were held up; the individuals concerned were obliged to hand over their employment cards and badges; they lost professional and technical skill by being prevented from flying and also incurred loss of earnings, etc.
.In its replies dated  April and  May , the Government first stresses the importance attached in Venezuelan legislation to the protection of trade union rights. It adds that the question of the suspension of several union officers of the VIASA Corporation was before the courts at the time of writing and that VIASA had also appealed to a higher judicial instance.
.Going into greater detail, the Government explains that the procedure laid down in the Labour Code and regulations issued thereunder had been applied: VIASA had requested that the above-mentioned events be considered as constituting grounds for dismissal and the members of the Union's executive committee were therefore summoned in accordance with administrative procedure so as to be heard and to state their defence. They had been enabled to do this in the presence of the competent labour inspector, who had made the impugned decision. In accordance with law, the said decision put an end to the administrative procedure - in other words, the Ministry of Labour had nothing more to do with the matter, despite what the complainant might say on the point.
.The Government states that the persons concerned were, on the other hand, able to appeal for annulment of the administrative decision made by the labour inspectorate by applying to the first instance of the Administrative Disputes Authority; they had done this and in a first decision dated  January , the said Authority ruled in favour of the Ministry of Labour.
.In a later communication dated  October , the Government adds that the Administrative Disputes Authority subsequently took an interlocutory decision to terminate the dismissal proceedings and to order reinstatement of the persons affected thereby. It also states that, although the Disputes Authority had not given a final ruling on the matter, the VIASA Corporation decided to accept the interlocutory order and to reinstate the members of the OSPV executive committee; the committee members had accordingly been able to resume their work and exercise their trade union rights to the full. The Government points out that relations between the Corporation and the Union are now normal and that collective bargaining - particularly in respect of improvements in aircraft pilots' salaries and new clauses on protection of freedom of association - is currently under way. The Government hopes the negotiations will bear fruit in the near future. In its communication of  February , the Government supplies the text of the ruling handed down by the Disputes Authority which orders the definitive reinstatement of the dismissed trade union leaders.
.This case relates to an alleged act of anti-union discrimination against the members of the executive committee of a pilots' union (OSVP) as part of a labour dispute within the Venezuelan International Aviation Corporation. In the view of the complainant, the suspension of the said committee members was unlawful because the cessation of activity by the aircraft pilots, which was at the root of the dispute, was due to technical reasons and had in fact, been ordered by the employer Corporation itself. In the Government's view, on the other hand, the action taken by the labour inspector was justified by an unlawful stoppage for which the aircraft pilots were to blame.
.The Committee recalls also that, as it has pointed out in previous cases, the dismissal or suspension of an employee, depriving him of his status as a trade union officer, is liable to affect the union's freedom of action and the worker's right to choose their representatives freely and may even encourage interference on the employer's part (See th Report, Case No.  (Sudan), para. .).
.In the present case, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the labour dispute at the root of the matter, which induced the VIASA Corporation to suspend the members of the OSPV's executive committee, is now in the course of being settled. It notes further that, as the result of a judicial decision, the trade union officers affected by anti-union discrimination have been reinstated in their jobs.
.Accordingly, given the information now at its disposal, the Committee considers that there is no point in continuing examination of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee recalls the importance it attaches to the principle that a worker or a trade union officer should not suffer prejudice by reason of his legitimate exercise of trade union activities.b) The Committee notes that the suspended trade union officers have been reinstated in their jobs and considers that there is no point in continuing the examination of this case.",0,1986,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
338,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Single Trade Union of Workers in the Iron and Steel and Related Industries of the State of Bolivar (SUTISS-BOLIVAR) dated  June . SUTISS-BOLIVAR sent additional information in a communication dated  September . The Government replied in communications dated  September and  November .
.Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that on  November , at the request of the Orinoco Iron and Steel Corporation (SIDOR), the Federation of Workers in the Metallurgical, Mining, Engineering and Related Industries of Venezuela (FETRAMETAL) and the Federation of Workers of the State of Bolivar (FETRA-BOLIVAR) signed a series of agreements, lacking any legal basis, aimed at withdrawing recognition of the executive Committee of SUTISS-BOLIVAR by suspending the members of the executive from trade union duties and activities of the members of the board and by imposing a parallel executive which was to sign a collective agreement with the SIDOR enterprise, together with the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV), FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR.
.According to the complainant, the parallel executive, in pursuance of the provisions of the above-mentioned agreements, in November  signed a collective agreement with SIDOR, the terms of which are inferior to those proposed by the legitimate executive for  months until in mid-October  the discussion of the draft collective agreement came to a standstill owing to the refusal of the enterprise to grant the minimum acceptable conditions; this refusal led the general assembly of SUTISS-BOLIVAR to initiate the legal procedure leading up to the declaration of a strike.
.In addition, the complainant states that on  November , before the above-mentioned agreements were signed, the executive of SUTISS-BOLIVAR, learning of the actions of SIDOR aimed fraudulently at dominating FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR, decided to withdraw from these federations and informed them of this the following day, as well as the enterprise and the labour inspectorate. The General Assembly of SUTISS-BOLIVAR, attended by , workers, unanimously ratified this decision on  November .
.In support of its assertions concerning the interference of SIDOR to secure the signing of a collective agreement in conditions favourable to itself, the complainant encloses a letter dated  February  signed by the President, the General Secretary and the Secretary for Collective Bargaining of FETRAMETAL, addressed to the members of the management of SIDOR, requesting approval of a contribution of  million bolivars as expenses incurred during the discussion and signing of the collective agreement concluded in November .
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that Andrs Velsquez and Eleuterio Benitez, President and General Secretary respectively of SUTISS-BOLIVAR, were arbitrarily dismissed.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that as a result of collective bargaining between the trade unions representing the workers, and the SIDOR enterprise for the purpose of signing a new labour agreement, some divergences arose between the executive Committee of SUTISS-BOLIVAR and the higher-level organisations to which it is affiliated, leading the latter to adopt measures to take over the said executive. These measures thus result from an inter-union dispute.
.The Government has sent the text of the agreements signed by FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR on  November , published in the press on  November, suspending from trade union activities the members of the SUTISS-BOLIVAR executive and nominating a provisional executive for the trade union. The Government has also sent the text of the ruling of the National Disciplinary Tribunal of FETRAMETAL, confirming the above-mentioned penalties and deciding to expel the members of the executive Committee of SUTISS-BOLIVAR and to relieve them definitively of the executive responsibilities they held in accordance with sections (a), (c), (d), (h), (i) and single subparagraph and section (d) of the by-laws of FETRAMETAL.
.The ruling mentioned above is based on the fact that after the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV) had ordered FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR to hold a consultation in the form of a referendum among the workers of SIDOR in order to decide whether to sign a collective agreement along the lines proposed by the CTV and these federations, or to continue the collective dispute which began when discussions on the draft collective agreement reached a standstill, and after the CTV had informed the executive of SUTISS-BOLIVAR of this, the latter rejected the consultation and publicly announced that it would boycott and sabotage it, ordering the workers to tear up their ballot papers and to abstain from voting. As the Tribunal's ruling states, the vote was nevertheless held on ,  and  November  with the result that, out of a total of , votes, there were , in favour of signing the collective agreement,  against and  invalid votes.
.The Government adds that it is not for it to decide on the validity or legitimacy of the executive Committee of SUTISS-BOLIVAR, as this is a matter for the legal bodies; it points out that SIDOR is a commercial enterprise, subject to the provisions of the Commercial Code, whose management acts independently of the executive authority, and that therefore the Government does not interfere in situations where the company must act in the capacity of an employer.
.Lastly, the Government has sent the text of the claim filed by members of the SUTISS-BOLIVAR executive with the court of the first instance, requesting that the suspension of the members of the executive of SUTISS-BOLIVAR be declared invalid, that the nomination of the executive appointed by FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR be declared unlawful, and that the collective agreement concluded between the SIDOR enterprise and the representatives of FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR, among others, be declared invalid. This claim contains the text of the letter of  January  referred to by the complainant.
.Lastly, referring to the dismissal of Mr. Andrs Velsquez and Mr. Eleutrio Benitez, the Government states that they have used the appeals procedure available in the labour legislation, in particular, the Act against unjustified dismissals.
.The Committee observes that the complainant has alleged that, as a result of acts of interference by the SIDOR enterprise with the SUTISS-BOLIVAR trade union through the FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR federations, the Latter agreed to the suspension from trade union duties and activities of the members of the executive Committee of SUTISS-BOLIVAR and to the imposing of a parallel executive; and that the SIDOR enterprise recognised this executive and, in November , concluded a collective agreement with it on terms favourable to the enterprise. In support of these allegations, the complainant states that the executive of SUTISS-BOLIVAR decided to discontinue the trade union's membership of FETRAMETAL on  November  and that this decision was upheld by the General Assembly on  November , that is, before the agreement of  November  in which FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR suspended the members of the executive of SUTISS-BOLIVAR. In addition, the complainant has supplied a letter dated  February , signed by three leaders of FETRAMETAL and addressed to the management of the SIDOR enterprise, requesting approval of a contribution of  million bolivars as expenses incurred during the discussion and signing of the collective agreement concluded in November .
.In this respect, the Committee observes that the Government has sent a copy of the agreement signed by FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR suspending the members of the executive of SUTISS-BOLIVAR and that the date of the agreement is not  November  as the complainant states - this being the date on which it appeared in the press - but  November, so that, as the by-laws of FETRAMETAL require the approval of the General Assembly for a decision to disaffiliate, and as this approval was obtained on  November , the complainant cannot use its disaffiliation as grounds for arguing that the agreement concluded between FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR is invalid, in order to prove the alleged interference of the enterprise in recognising the parallel executive and later negotiating a collective agreement. Furthermore, to judge from the documents sent by the complainant, the first item on the agenda drawn up at the extraordinary session of the General Assembly of SUTISS-BOLIVAR on  November  is ""intervention in the affairs of SUTISS-BOLIVAR"". As for the letter of  February  signed by three leaders of FETRAMETAL and addressed to the management of SIDOR, the Committee considers - without prejudice to what may be concluded by the Venezuelan legal authorities which will rule on the case, with greater possibilities of evidence - that it does not in itself prove that acts of interference were committed by SIDOR, firstly because this letter is not signed by the enterprise, but by FETRAMETAL trade union leaders, secondly because, although the letter contains a request for  million bolivars from the enterprise, which sum had been determined unofficially with the chairman of the board of management, they are requested as expenses incurred in negotiating and signing the agreement, without any indication of the date on which the sum was determined, and lastly because the same",0,1982,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
339,"Letter mentions that similar sums have been paid to other trade unions for similar purposes and that this is a general practice.
.The Committee notes in addition that, according to the Government, the intervention measures against the executive of SUTISS-BOLIVAR adopted by FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR were the result of an inter-union dispute. The Committee notes further that the examination of the agreement between FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR and of the ruling of the National Disciplinary Tribunal of FETRAMETAL indicates that the intervention measures against the executive of SUTISS-BOLIVAR constitute a penalty imposed by the Committee on Infringements of Discipline for violation of the bylaws of FETRAMETAL and that the fundamental reasons for these measures was the rejection of and attempt to boycott and sabotage the consultation with SIDOR workers held by means of a referendum decided on by FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR, for the purpose of deciding whether to sign a collective agreement along the lines proposed by the CTV and these federations, or to continue the collective dispute resulting from SIDOR's refusal to accept the terms required by SUTISS-BOLIVAR in discussions of the draft collective agreement which had been going on for nearly one year.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the complainant has not proved that acts of interference in the affairs of SUTISS-BOLIVAR were committed by the SIDOR enterprise, and that the penalties against the executive Committee of SUTISS-BOLIVAR adopted by FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR appear to belong to a purely inter-trade union context. In this respect, the Committee must point out, as it has on previous occasions, that inter-union disputes are outside the scope of Convention No. , since Article  is designed to protect workers' organisations against employers' organisations or their agents or members and not against other workers' organisations or the agents or members thereof. Therefore, taking note of the fact that the Venezuelan legal authorities will rule on the validity of the penalties adopted by FETRAMETAL and FETRA-BOLIVAR against SUTISS-BOLIVAR and on that of the collective agreement concluded by the provisional executive nominated by these federations, the Committee considers that the allegations in question do not call for further examination.
.Lastly, as regards the allegation concerning the arbitrary dismissal of Andrs Velsquez and Eleuterio Benitez, President and General Secretary, respectively, of SUTISS-BOLIVAR, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, they have used the appeal procedures available under the legislation, in particular, under the Act against unjustified dismissals. The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the decision of the appeals authorities concerning these dismissals.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) as regards the allegations concerning acts of interference by the SIDOR enterprise in the affairs of the trade union SUTISS-BOLIVAR, the Committee considers that they do not call for further examination;(b) as regards the allegation concerning the arbitrary dismissal of Andrs Velsquez and Eleuterio Benitez, the President and General Secretary, respectively, of SUTISS-BOLIVAR, the Committee notes that they have used the appeal procedures available under the legislation and requests the Government to send the text of the decision of the appeals authorities concerning these dismissals.",0,1982,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
340,".This complaint, presented by the Federation of Electrical Workers of Venezuela, appears in a communication sent direct to the ILO and dated  April . The complaint was duly referred to the Government of Venezuela for its comments, which were received in a communication dated  August .
.Venezuela has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege (in rather general terms, incidentally) that persons employed by the C.A. de Administracin y de Fomento Elctrico (CADAFE)- a state Organisation have been the object of various harassments, attributable very largely to the differences of political ideology which exist between workers and management. In particular, so the complainants allege, there has been some encroachment on the workers' right democratically to elect their representatives, and some workers have, it is claimed, been dismissed.
.The Government's answer consists of copies of two communications; one from the complainant organisation and the other from CADAFE, addressed to the Minister of Labour.
.The communication from CADAFE states that an agreement has been reached between the complainant organisation and the company that "" any problems which might at one time have existed have now been settled "", and that "" the situation has now returned to normal "".
.The communication from the complainant organisation to the Minister of Labour reads as follows: "" The complaint which we presented to the International Labour Organisation had its origins in the serious disputes which occurred within the administration of the Hydro-electric Works Department of the Rio Santo Domingo Hydroelectric System. We now have the pleasure to inform you that, as a result of the inestimable assistance rendered by the labour authorities, a solution to the problem has been found which satisfied both parties.""
.In these circumstances, the Committee feels that there is no point in pursuing this matter further, and hence recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case calls for no further consideration.",0,1970,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
341,".In a communication dated  December , addressed to the ILO directly, the International Metalworkers' Federation announced that on behalf of its Venezuelan affiliate FETRAMETAL it wished to lodge a complaint against the Government of Venezuela for breach of freedom of association. The Federation alleged that on  December , Mr. Mollegas, Chairman, and Mr. Mercano, Secretary of FETRAMETAL, were arrested by government agents and dragged off to an unknown destination, outside the area in which the Orinoco steelworkers' strike was proceeding. Members of FETRAMETAL were, it was said, full of the deepest misgivings concerning the fate of these two men.
.The Government of Venezuela having been at once acquainted, by telegram, with the contents of this message, it cabled back on  December . In this telegram, the Government said that the strike recently declared in the National Steel Company had been entirely illegal, and that thirty-two unions, as well as the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (the leaders of which had condemned the stoppage as illegal) had come out against it. Mr. Mollegas had been detained for reasons which had nothing to do with his trade union activities, and the matter had been referred to the Disciplinary Tribunal of the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers after his conduct had been questioned by the workers themselves. Steelworkers, and "" others in the steel areas "" had condemned the attitude taken up by FETRAMETAL, because industrial plant had been sabotaged and violence used against workers anxious to carry on. The Confederation of Venezuelan Workers had withdrawn the authorisation given to FETRAMETAL to conduct the dispute because of the attitude adopted by Mollegas. As to Mercano, the Government denied that he was in custody.
.On  December , the complainants wrote to the Director-General in the following terms:Having learnt that Mollegas and Mercano are no longer being held incommunicado, and that negotiations with a view to their release are proceeding in a more normal atmosphere, our affiliate has asked us to withdraw the complaint made against the Government of Venezuela. Immediate economic problems are in process of solution, it appears. A special parliamentary committee has been set up and the causes of the present position in the iron and steel industry are under investigation. This being so, we consider that the interest taken in this matter by international organisations has been instrumental in getting these questions thoroughly investigated, and that there is every reason to hope for a satisfactory outcome. However, it seems to us that at this stage it would be better if the Venezuelans themselves were left to decide what action should be taken.
.On  January  the complainant organisation again wrote to the Director-General to say that the matters which had given rise to the complaint had been settled by a new collective agreement which had the Government's backing. The letter added:However, I wish to thank you, and the ILO, for your speed in cabling the Venezuelan Minister of Labour; such action, quite certainly, played apart in improving the atmosphere and contributed, in particular, to the release of the trade union leaders arrested, besides facilitating a settlement of the strike.
.When, in the past, the Committee has found itself faced with a situation of this kind, it has always taken the view that: the desire shown by a complaining organisation to withdraw its complaint, while it constitutes a factor to which the greatest attention must be paid, is not, however, in itself sufficient reason for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed with the examination of the complaint. The Committee has always felt free to evaluate the reasons given to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to investigate whether these appear sufficiently plausible to lead one to believe that the withdrawal was made in complete independence.
.In this particular instance, there is no reason to believe that the complainant organisation was not fully independent in deciding to withdraw its complaint. Moreover, as it says itself, the reasons which prompted the complaint no longer obtain, while the labour dispute that had been proceeding has ceased with the conclusion of a new collective agreement.
.Under cover of a letter, dated  February , the Government, referring to the fact that the complainants have dropped their complaint and "" with a view to informing the Committee on Freedom of Association of the illegality of the strike and of the lawfulness of the detention of the trade union leaders which had formed the subject-matter of the dispute "", submits the text of a report dealing with certain legal aspects of the dispute together with photostats of numerous articles which have appeared in the press containing views and opinions relating thereto.
.In view of the fact that the complainant organisation has withdrawn its complaint for the reason that the problem which had given rise to the dispute has now been resolved, the Committee, considering that it would be pointless, under the circumstances, to proceed to an examination of the merits of the affair, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",0,1969,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of

.Venezuela has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that Mr. Julio Campos, their representative at the Congress of the Central Federation of Venezuelan Workers, who had gone to Caracas at the invitation, of the workers of that country, was arrested on orders from the Government of Venezuela.
.In its observations the Government states that on  September  (the day before the complainants' telegram was sent to the I.L.O.), several Caracas newspapers published articles according to which a Juan Campos, a Chilean trade unionist who had been invited to a meeting of the Central Federation of Venezuelan Workers, had been arrested. At this news, and as none of the national security services was aware of the alleged arrest, an administrative inquiry was made among the immigration services. The inquiry revealed that no one by the name of Juan Campos had entered the country but that two persons called Julio Campos, one a Colombian, the other a Chilean, had entered Venezuela, the second of these persons having stated that he was going to stay at the Caroni Hotel. When the police subsequently discovered that the person in question was not in fact staying at the Caroni Hotel, he was ordered to present himself for questioning, as is the normal practice with aliens in the country.
.When Mr. Julio Campos presented himself to the police, he was asked to state the purpose of his visit to Venezuela; Mr. Campos replied that he had come to Venezuela with the intention of visiting Caracas; when the police asked him why he had not attended the meetings of the Central Federation of Venezuelan Workers, he replied that he had come to Venezuela mainly as a tourist. The Government states that Mr. Campos did not come to Venezuela at the invitation of the Central Federation of Venezuelan Workers and had not attended the meetings of this organisation.
.After the above-mentioned check, the Government states that Mr. Campos was allowed to go free and that he left the country at a later date.
.From the information at the disposal of the Committee it would appear that the complaint of the Central Federation of Chilean Workers is based on erroneous information published in the Venezuelan press. From the detailed explanations furnished by the Government it is also clear that Mr. Campos was not detained and that he was able to leave the country freely.
.In these circumstances, considering that no useful purpose would be served in examining this matter further, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case calls for no further examination on its part.",0,1967,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
343,".The Committee examined this case at its meetings in February and November  and most recently at its meeting in November . In this connection it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its st Report, and paragraphs  to  of its th Report. The Governing Body approved these reports at its sessions in February-March , November  and November  respectively.
.Venezuela has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but since the last time the Committee examined the case it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The first of the complainants supplied the names of thirty persons who, they claimed, had been arrested as a result of the Government's policy of repression against part of the trade union movement. The complainants stated that those arrested were national or regional leaders of the Sole Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CUTV).
.In its first reply the Government stated that none of the persons named by the complainants had been detained for carrying on lawful activities, whether connected with trade unionism or not; most of them had never been trade union leaders and had been sentenced for offences under civil and military law in proceedings before judges on whom the Government had exerted no influence.
.In accordance with the practice which it has constantly applied in cases where allegations that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested or detained on account of their trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests had been made on the grounds of subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or owing to offences under ordinary law, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to indicate the exact reasons for these arrests, to state whether each of the persons concerned had been brought to trial on the charges made against them, and to communicate the results of the legal proceedings in each case.
.On the basis of the information supplied by the Government in reply to this and subsequent requests the Committee presented its final conclusions with regard to all the persons mentioned in the complaint, except the following: Messrs. Pardo Lugo, Reyes Bidau, Gutirrez, Landaz, Puche Ferrer, Colorado, Acosta, Farias, Scott Power, Casique and Luis Marcano.
.According to information provided by the Government some of these persons had been arrested on several occasions between  and December  on the grounds of subversive activities or in connection with inquiries relating to such activities. For example, the Government stated that Mr. Scott Power had been arrested in April  in connection with inquiries into incitement to disorder and extremist agitation, and that Mr. Pardo had been arrested in February , in  and in December  on grounds connected with the disturbance of public order or for the investigation of subversive activities.
.In its st Report the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to confirm whether all of these persons had been released. In the absence of any reply by the Government the recommendation was repeated in the th Report.
.On  February  the Government sent a communication stating that, in accordance with verbal information provided by Mr. Cruz Villegas, President of the Sole Confederation of Venezuelan Workers, his organisation's complaint had been withdrawn verbally by its representatives at a meeting at the ILO's headquarters in Geneva, which explained why there was no document containing formal withdrawal of the complaint.
.Following this communication the Sole Confederation of Venezuelan Workers and the World Federation of Trade Unions were requested on repeated occasions to send whatever information they might consider pertinent concerning any decision taken by them with regard to the complaint and to state the grounds therefor. The Committee observes that no reply has been received to date from the complainant organisations.
.In these circumstances, in view of the time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the events concerning the persons mentioned in paragraph  above and in the absence of any information from the complainant organisations in reply to the repeated requests addressed to them, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case as a whole does not call for any further examination.
.The Committee previously considered this case at its sessions in February and November , when it submitted to the Governing Body the interim reports contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its st Report, which were adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ) and th Session (November ) respectively.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government of Venezuela supplied the additional information requested from it in connection with certain aspects of the case which are still outstanding.
.Venezuela has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, according to the texts of the judgments supplied by the Government, Messrs. Torres, Ojeda and Blanco were sentenced for activities considered as offences of rebellion, which do not seem to have had any connection with trade union activities, and to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.(b) to note that the sentence passed by the ordinary courts on Mr. Granda was quashed by the court to which the matter was subsequently referred and to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination;(c) to take note of the Government's statement that the cases against Messrs. Arrieti, Galndez, Villaparedes, Lucker Ruiz and Mrquez Findol, before courts martial for acts considered as offences of rebellion have been discontinued, and to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(d) to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , that there would be no point in continuing its examination of the allegations relating to Messrs. Arrieta and Carmona Natera;(e) to request the Government to be good enough to confirm whether the persons mentioned in paragraph  above, who, according to a previous statement by the Government, had been detained at different times, are at present at liberty;(f) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the information requested from the Government in subparagraph (e) above.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).
.By a communication dated  May  the Government replied to the request made in paragraphs ,  and  of the th Report for additional information on certain aspects of the case.
.Venezuela has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee therefore observes that, of the persons about whom the Government has provided information, some have been released; others have been detained, temporarily it appears, though it is not clear whether they are all at present free, and others have been sentenced (one of them by an ordinary criminal court) for offences the precise nature of which is indicated by the Government, or are detained at the disposal of the military courts on grounds that the Government also indicates precisely.
.With respect to the persons whose names appear in paragraph  above, who were released and one of whom, Mr. Juan Pablo Crespo, according to the complainants, later died, the Committee considers that there would be no point in continuing its examination of the allegations relating to their detention.
.On the other hand, with respect to the persons whose names appear in paragraph  above, the Committee would be grateful if the Government would be good enough to confirm whether they are all at liberty.
.Moreover, in paragraph  of its th Report, relating to the present case, the Committee recalled that in matters that were the subject of judicial proceedings, where the Committee had considered that such proceedings might make available information of assistance to it in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded, it had always followed the practice of requesting the governments concerned to supply the texts of the judgments given and the grounds adduced therein. Accordingly, in view of the contradiction existing between the statements of the complainants and those of the Government concerning the grounds for the detentions, the Committee considers that it would be desirable, with",0,1966,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
344,"a view to reaching definitive conclusions, to have the text of the sentences pronounced on the persons named in paragraphs  and  above.
.With regard to the persons whose names appear in paragraph  above, the Committee wishes to recall that in all cases in which trade unionists have been detained, either for political offences or for common-law crimes, the Committee has emphasised the importance it attaches to the right of trade unionists, like all other persons, to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority. The Government denies that the persons in question were acting as trade unionists in the circumstances leading to their arrest and indictment. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that it would be desirable to request the Government to be good enough to report on the stage reached in the trials in question and the rules of procedure applied by the military courts and also to communicate the text of the sentences handed down with respect to these persons as well as the motives adduced therein.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the statement by the Government concerning the grounds for the detentions and to decide that the allegations relating to the detention of the persons named in paragraph  above do not call for further examination. It further recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to supply the additional information indicated in paragraphs  to  above.
.With respect to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) subject to the principle set out in paragraph  above and for the reasons expressed in paragraphs  and , to decide that the allegations relating to acts of repression and discrimination against certain trade union organisations and to infringement of trade union privilege do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the detention of trade union leaders:(i) to take note of the statements by the Government that the measures in question have been taken on the grounds of criminal offences or subversive activities;(ii) for the reasons expressed in paragraph  above, to decide that the allegations relating to the detention of the persons named in paragraph  do not call for further examination;(iii) for the reasons expressed in paragraph  above, to request the Government to be good enough to send the text of the sentences passed on the four persons named in paragraphs  and ;(iv) with regard to the five persons whose trials are pending before military courts and whose names appear in paragraph  above, and for the reasons expressed in paragraph , to request the Government to be good enough to inform it of the rules of procedure applied by these military courts and on the stage reached in the trials in question and also to communicate the text of any sentences that may have been handed down;(v) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the measures that are alleged to have been taken against the two persons named in paragraph  above;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the additional information requested from the Government in subparagraph (b) (iii), (iv) and (v) of this paragraph and the confirmation requested by the Committee in paragraph  above.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  sent to the I.L.O by the Sole Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (C.U.T.V.). By a communication dated  June  the World Federation of Trade Unions expressed its support for the said complaint. The text of both communications was transmitted to the Government, which replied by letter dated  November .
.Venezuela has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In addition to some general references to social and economic problems which are said by the complainants to afflict the mass of the population (unemployment, high cost of living, etc.), the text of the complaint presented by C.U.T.V and its appendices contain a number of allegations in support of its claim that the "" unofficial workers' movement "" in Venezuela has been repressed, persecuted and ill-treated. According to the complainants this policy of repression of the "" workers' and people's movement "" has manifested itself in many ways, not being confined to police coercion but involving also the systematic violation of the Constitution, basic legal procedure in courts and human rights. Some of the allegations concern the arrest, trial and ill-treatment of a large number of persons, whose names are given. According to the complainants some of these persons are politicians, students, "" peasants "" or ordinary citizens, while others are trade union members or officials. Other allegations accuse the authorities of engaging in acts of repression and discrimination against C.U.T.V and its affiliated unions and restricting the right to strike and to bargain collectively.
.Those allegations which refer specifically to alleged infringement of freedom of association are examined separately below, together with the Government's comments upon them.Allegations relating to Acts of Repression and Discrimination against Certain Trade Union Organisations
.C.U.T.V's complaint alleges that there have been constant raids by the police without judicial authority on trade union premises, like that which took place at the central headquarters of C.U.T.V in , when the police seized files and other property of the organisation. The same is said to have happened repeatedly at the offices of regional federations in the states of Lara, Zulia, Monagas and Carabobo, and on the premises of trade unions in various parts of the country. Even at workplaces the workers are constantly supervised and threatened by police officers attached to the staff of undertakings under agreements between the authorities and the employers. In this way discriminatory action is taken against members of the trade unions belonging to C.U.T.V, who, as soon as they are identified as such, are dismissed. For their part, the labour inspectorates and other authorities set up for the purposes of conciliation and arbitration in labour-management disputes and to ensure the enforcement of the law and the safeguarding of workers' rights, far from carrying out these functions, impede the activities of trade union organisations which do not support the Government and join forces with the employers to damage the interests of the workers.
.In its reply of  November  the Government rejects the complainants' allegation that a policy of repression and persecution of the "" unofficial workers' movement "" has been pursued in Venezuela. To show the falsity of this assertion to the effect that an institutional and democratic government, voted into office under the Constitutional procedure, resorts to force or illegality, it is enough, according to the Government, to observe the simple fact that the very organisation making the complaint was established and legally approved in , being composed of four federations which in their turn covered  trade unions. In the procedure for the legal approval of trade unions no kind of discrimination is applied or tolerated. All organisations that have complied with the conditions required by the Labour Act and the regulations issued under it have been legally approved within the period laid down by law. Between  and  legal approval was given to , trade unions. There is likewise no truth in the assertion that the labour inspectorates and other bodies concerned with labour matters fail to carry out their functions and join forces with the employers. Labour officials of all grades enjoy the confidence and the gratitude of both sides in labour relations. The Government carries out programmes to improve the qualifications of these officials and the efficiency of the services.
.The Committee observes that in its reply the Government categorically denies that the authorities resort to force or unlawful action against workers' organisations, that any form of discrimination is practised in connection with the legal approval of trade unions or that bias is shown by labour officials. However, the Government makes no comment on the allegations in the complaint concerning the raiding of trade union premises, police intervention at workplaces or the dismissal of workers for the sole reason, according to the complainants, that they belong to unions affiliated to C.U.T.V. Consequently, before proceeding with its examination of this aspect of the case, the Committee considers that the Government should be requested to furnish its observations with respect to the three points mentioned.Allegations relating to the Right to Strike and to Bargain Collectively
.It is stated in the complaint that although the right to strike is confirmed in the Constitution and in the Labour Act it has in practice been suppressed, since the Government does not allow strikes by the organisations affiliated to C.U.T.V, or even by the unions belonging to the pro-government labour Confederation. In another part of the complaint it is asserted that the collective bargaining",1,1966,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
345,"system is applied more and more infrequently, due to the undisguised opposition of employers and Government, who are supported by those trade union organisations which have gone over to the side of the Government.
.The Government replies to these allegations, which are couched in extremely general terms and unsubstantiated by specific examples, by explaining that the small number of strikes recorded is due to the efficiency of the conciliation procedure. The Government points out that one of the most important strikes to occur in the country was organised by C.U.T.V itself in , at which time the Ministry of Labour was only too anxious to lend its good offices for conciliation purposes, and the Government took no action which would interfere with the rights of the workers. As for collective bargaining, the Government states that during the past eight years , collective agreements have been signed, including  in  and  in , all of which is claimed to prove the falsity of the allegations that there has been a reduction in the number of collective agreements signed in the country.
.Considering that the complainants have not supplied specific information in substantiation of their claims with respect to alleged restriction of the right to strike and to bargain collectively, which are couched in extremely general terms and which are denied by the Government, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.Allegations relating to the Infringement of Trade Union Privilege
.The complainants claim that there has been infringement of the privileges conferred on members of the committees of federations, trade unions and works committees by the labour legislation and by collective agreements to protect them from arbitrary and unjust dismissal. They add that in countless cases not only have employers dismissed trade union leaders who should be protected by these privileges but the labour authorities themselves have condoned this practice in their subsequent rulings, which are nearly always in favour of the employers.
.In its observations the Government does not refer specifically to this aspect of the case. Consequently, before proceeding with its examination thereof, the Committee considers that the Government should be requested to be good enough to forward its observations with respect to this point.Allegations relating to the Detention of Trade Union Leaders
.The complainants allege that the unlawful detention of trade union leaders, militant workers and peasants is a common daily occurrence, which clearly shows the nature of the Government's policy of repression against the country's democratic and independent trade union movement. The aims of this policy are to sow terror among the workers, undermine their capacity for resistance and weaken the organisations they have formed for their economic defence. At present there are more than , political prisoners in various prisons throughout the country, the great majority being manual workers, salaried employees, students and peasants. Among the numerous national and regional leaders of C.U.T.V alleged by the complainants to be held in prison mention is made of Eloy Torres, Luis Felipe Ojeda, Julio Cabello, Eleazar Diaz Rangel, Efrain Blanco, Samuel Guidn, Aura Gamboa, Gustavo Villaparedes, Leoncio Granda, Humberto Arrieti and Justo Rafael Galindez. Eloy Torres is said by the complainants to be a former official of the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers and one of the founders of C.U.T.V, as well as being a member of the General Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He is alleged to have been summarily tried before a military court and sentenced to more than eight years' penal servitude in May . He is now serving a sentence of rigorous imprisonment on the island of Tacarigua.
.Repressive measures are said to have also been taken against other national and regional leaders of C.U.T.V, such as Horacio Scott Power, President of C.U.T.V, detained without trial for two months in ; Carlos Arturo Pardo, a member of the executive of C.U.T.V, arrested upon his return from the VIth Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Warsaw and taken to the concentration camp of Cachipo, where he was subjected to physical ill-treatment; and Jos Marcano, a member of the national secretariat of C.U.T.V and President of the National Federation of Salaried Employees of Venezuela, detained without trial on ten separate occasions. Others detained include Messrs. Mximo Gutirrez, Johnny Bid, Carlos Farias, Marco Aurelio Alegria, Manuel Luckert, Jess Mrquez, Fidias Marcano, Hctor Landez, Julio Casique, Eli Sal Puchi, Nicols Colorado, Vladimir Acosta and Luis Marcano.
.Another national C.U.T.V leader, Mr. Juan Pablo Crespo, is alleged to have been arrested by the police as he was about to leave for abroad to undergo medical treatment. Some time later he was released, and he subsequently died in Moscow. The complaint also mentions the case of Mr. Luis Emiro Arrieta, another C.U.T.V leader who died in prison in Caracas after two years' detention. In addition, a press cutting is appended to the complaint referring to the disappearance since  September  of Donato Carmona Natera, "" trade union leader in the building sector and militant revolutionary "": the General Directorate of Police announced first of all that he was in solitary confinement, later that he had been released and finally that "" the files would be carefully gone over "".
.Mention is also made in the complaint of numerous other persons alleged to have been detained, but on the complainants' own admission these are political leaders, students or ordinary citizens whose connection with the trade union movement is not established in the complaint.
.According to the Government, this part of the complaint deals with questions unconnected with labour. The Government adds that none of the persons named by the complainants has been detained for carrying on lawful activities, whether connected with trade unionism or not. Most of the persons referred to have never been trade union officials. They have, however, been charged, tried and sentenced for proved offences under civil and military law in proceedings before judges on whom the Government has exerted no influence. The Government carries out to the letter the duties imposed on it by the Constitution and by the law of the land. It has dealt vigorously, but without overstepping the bounds of the law, with persons outside the trade unions who, acting not as trade unionists but as active agents of subversion, have endeavoured to undermine the Constitution and the law.
.The Committee recalls that on many occasions in the past, where allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested or detained for trade union activities have been met by governments with statements that the arrests or detentions were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common-law crimes, it has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the exact reasons therefor. The Committee also recalls that if, in certain cases, it has concluded that allegations relating to the arrest or detention of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere, which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. Finally, the Committee recalls that in matters which were the subject of judicial proceedings, where the Committee considered that such proceedings might make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded, it has always followed the practice of requesting the governments concerned to supply the texts of the judgments given and the grounds adduced therein.
.In consequence, before proceeding further with its examination of this aspect of the case, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish as quickly as possible detailed observations with respect to the alleged detention of the persons whose names are given in paragraphs ,  and  above, together with the exact reasons therefor; to state whether each of these persons has been brought to trial on the charges which have been laid against him, and to communicate the results of any legal proceedings which have been initiated in this connection.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the right to strike and to bargain collectively, to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to acts of repression and discrimination against certain trade union organisations and the allegations relating to the infringement of trade union privilege, to note that the Committee considers it necessary to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on each of the matters referred to in paragraphs  and  above;(c) with regard to the allegations relating",1,1966,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
346,"to the detention of trade union leaders, to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, to be good enough to furnish as quickly as possible detailed observations with respect to the alleged detention of the persons whose names are given in paragraphs ,  and , together with the exact reasons therefor; to state whether each of these persons has been brought to trial on the charges which have been laid against him, and to communicate the results of any legal proceedings which have been initiated in this connection;(d) to take note of the present interim report with respect to the allegations referred to in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph, on the understanding that the Committee will report further once it has received from the Government the observations and additional information specified in the said subparagraphs.",1,1966,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
347,".By a communication dated  June , addressed directly to the I.L.O, the Printing Workers' Union of Zulia presented a complaint of alleged infringement of freedom of association against the Government of Venezuela. The complainants were informed, by a letter dated  July , of their right to furnish further information in substantiation of their complaint within a period of one month ; but they did not avail themselves of this right. The complaint was transmitted to the Government, for its observations, by a letter also dated  July  ; the Government forwarded its observations on  October .
.At its th Session (Geneva,  and  November ) the Committee decided to defer examination of the case until the present session because the Government's observations had been received too late to be examined in November.
.Venezuela has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication, the complaining organisation states that officials in the service of the government political party promote fragmentation by threatening to dismiss employees of the Government Printing Office unless they renounce their membership of the Union. It alleges that an attempt is being made to found a parallel organisation and that the acts denounced amount to introducing party politics into the trade union movement.
.In its reply the Government rejects the complaint, stating that Venezuela has a democratic rgime and that the conditions attached to establishing a trade union are defined in statutory provisions. It adds that the complainant union is dominated by extremist elements, that despite this there has been no political interference with it, and that no parallel trade union organisation has been established nor is any such action intended.
.The Committee observes that the complainants have made allegations in very general terms and that no particular person is mentioned, no date is given to the alleged events and all significant details such as might give the accusations point are omitted, so that no sufficient evidence has been adduced to support the complaint.
.Accordingly, the Committee, while it has always attached the greatest importance to the principle enunciated in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), that "" workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment "", considers that in the present case the complainants have not produced sufficient evidence to permit of an examination of the case on its merits.",0,1963,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
348,".The Committee had occasion to submit conclusions to the Governing Body on a number of complaints relating to alleged violation of trade union rights in Venezuela in its First and Sixth Reports. A brief summary of these is given below.Complaints of the American Federation of Labor and, the Venezuelan General Confederation of Labour
.These complaints, analysed in the First Report of the Committee related to the general situation of the trade union movement in Venezuela following the assumption of power by a Military Junta on  November . The trade union movement was alleged to have been the subject of a campaign of repression culminating in the dissolution, by administrative action, of the Venezuelan General Federation of Labour and its affiliated federations of trade unions. Many trade union leaders were stated to have been imprisoned ; it was alleged that trade union premises were closed and the goods of all the dissolved associations seized. The trade union press was suppressed ; workers were persecuted on the pretext of participation in subversive political activities. The remaining trade union organisations which were not then dissolved were alleged to have been obliged, by ministerial order, to renew their executive bodies, the former officials being declared ineligible for re-election.
.The remaining allegations related to the dissolution of  petroleum workers' organisations-again by administrative action. The reason for this dissolution is alleged to have been a strike in the oilfields. The workers are alleged to have been subjected to measures of repression, including the incarceration of more than , of them.
.With regard to these two allegations, the Government presented a number of observations' to the effect that the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour was ordered because of the participation of that organisation in an illegal political strike. The Government took this measure only when it was apparent that the Confederation had been turned into an instrument for political agitation, its unlawful activities having culminated in the presentation of an ultimatum to the Government on  February  threatening resort to direct action. In the face of such a challenge the Government proceeded to dissolve the organisation. The illegal character of the activities of the Confederation contravened the provisions of the Labour Code and the regulations issued under it relating to the procedure laid down for initiating collective disputes. The freezing of trade union funds was ordered so as to prevent them being used for purposes foreign to trade union activity. The detention of trade union leaders, ordered as a security measure, was a measure taken exclusively on the ground of their political activities.
.With regard to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Government stated that this dissolution was ordered because the unions concerned ordered a strike contrary to formal provisions contained in the collective agreements then in force. The sanctions taken for illegal strikes were based on provisions of the Labour Code and the Government considered that similar measures had been taken in other countries and had not, in its view, constituted an infringement of freedom of association. According to the Government, a considerable number of the petroleum workers' unions subsequently reorganised and initiated new collective agreements.Conclusions of the Committee in Its First Report
.In its First Report the Committee adopted the following conclusions:
.With regard to the allegations relating to the general situation of the trade union movement in Venezuela, the Governing Body has at its disposal the report of the I.L.O Mission to Venezuela and the observations of the Government of Venezuela on the same report. The data necessary for appreciating the position are therefore available.
.The dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, to which the second part of the complaint relates, took place after the events dealt with in the above documents and have therefore not been the subject of any similar examination. The versions given by the Government and by the complainants differ considerably with regard to the circumstances under which the events took place which gave rise to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, but they are in agreement as to the dissolution having actually taken place. It is quite clear from the text of the dissolution decree attached to the complaint that the measure was taken by the administrative authorities without the case first having been submitted to the competent courts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends that the case merits further examination by the Governing Body.
.With respect to the future policy to be followed, the Committee made the following pronouncement in the same report:
.The Venezuelan Government has not been formally requested to indicate whether it would be willing to consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission. Under the procedure laid down by the Governing Body this question does not arise until the Governing Body itself has decided that the Government concerned shall be asked to give its consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding Commission. Although the Government has indicated in its preliminary observations on the complaint that it would not be willing to consent to such reference, the Committee does not consider that such a preliminary reply precludes the Governing Body from discussing further whether it is advisable to make a formal request to the Government concerned that it should consent to reference of a case to the Fact-Finding Commission. They venture to hope that in future cases the preliminary observations of governments will not anticipate any request which the Governing Body may or may not think it appropriate to make after it has had an opportunity of considering the facts of the case and expressing its views ....Decision of the Committee Contained in Its Third Report
.The conclusions adopted in its First Report were amended by the Committee in its Third Report, as follows:
.The Committee also had before it a letter from Mr. Montoya, Venezuelan Government representative on the Governing Body, informing the Committee that he had further observations to present on behalf of his Government relating to Case No.  (Venezuela). Under these circumstances, the Committee decided to amend the recommendation which it had submitted to the Governing Body in its First Report and, accordingly, recommends the Governing Body to postpone examination of this case in order to enable the Venezuelan Government to transmit its supplementary observations to the Committee. The Committee will report further on this case to the Governing Body when the observations in question have been transmitted to it.
.The Governing Body, at its th Session (Geneva, March ), considered the First and Third Reports of the Committee and decided to postpone the examination of the case.Complaints of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and Other Trade Union Organisations
.In the meantime, a complaint dated  April  was received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and communicated to the Government of Venezuela which confirmed and supplemented similar complaints against the Government of Venezuela presented to the Economic and Social Council by various trade union organisations.
.These complaints which, in part, repeat the allegations made in the earlier communications from the American Federation of Labor and the Venezuelan Confederation of Labour, related especially to the dissolution of various trade unions in  and to the dissolution of the petroleum industry trade unions in . They also alleged the detention of trade union leaders.
.With respect to these new complaints, as with respect to the earlier complaints, the Government presented a series of observations in separate communications forming a continuous whole and, through its representative, presented verbal statements at the Committee's meeting on  June .
.In its communication dated  May  the Government stated that there had been important developments in the trade union situation in Venezuela. Since January  a large number of trade unions had been legally constituted and by the middle of  there existed a total of  trade unions and four federations. In the view of the Government, these figures demonstrated that the Government favoured the development of trade unionism but did not mean that it could tolerate the affiliation of trade union organisations to national or foreign political parties or their engaging in political activities foreign to the purposes expressly assigned to them by the Labour Law. The exercise of the right of meeting had also been facilitated, previous authorisation no longer being required. The number of collective agreements had increased appreciably between  and . In particular, the Government had paid particular attention to negotiations in the petroleum industry, the Ministry of Labour having obtained from the petroleum undertakings a promise not to alter working conditions during the negotiation of the new contracts. The Government had given aid to the trade union organisations by assuming the costs of premises and materials. With reference to the freezing of the funds of the dissolved organisations, the administrative commission charged with administration of the funds had returned a considerable sum to new trade unions formed by workers who had belonged to the dissolved organisations. Each case of devolution of funds had been thoroughly studied.
.In the same communication, the Government analysed the jurisprudence of the Committee",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
349,"on Freedom of Association in other cases, particularly with respect to Case No.  concerning the complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions against the Government of the United Kingdom (Cyprus). The Government considered that the complaints presented against the Government of Venezuela were similar to those examined in Case No. , dealing with associations of a clearly political character.
.In a second communication of the same date,  May , the Government of Venezuela called attention to the report of the Credentials Committee of the th Session of the International Labour Conference. In that report, the Credentials Committee recommended the rejection of the protest presented against the credentials of the Venezuelan Workers' delegate to the Conference.
.In the statements presented verbally by the representative of the Venezuelan Government at the meeting of the Committee on  June , the Government declared that the strike which had led to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions was, from the juridical point of view, an illegal movement, because the trade unions which caused it were bound by collective agreements. The Government had warned the trade unions of this before it proceeded to dissolve them, but in view of their refusal to take heed, the Government found itself obliged to dissolve the trade unions in order to maintain production in the petroleum industry which was vital to the country.
.In its later communications, dated  November ,  November  and  February , the Government repeated its earlier statements, because it considered that the new complaints which had been transmitted to it-the complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and similar complaints-did not contain any new allegations. The Government transmitted to the Committee the text of a speech made by the President of the Government Junta on the eve of the elections on  November , in which he stated that the policy of the Venezuelan Government was to re-establish in the country a Constitutional rgime expressed through the will of the people. In its last communication, dated  February , the Government presented a memorandum on the evolution of the trade union situation. It stated that the Ministry of Labour had adopted a liberal policy and that no restrictive measure had been taken against the trade union movement. With the creation of new trade unions in various regions of the country the ground was prepared for the Constitution of a national Confederation. The freedom of action enjoyed by the trade unions was demonstrated by the extensive amount of collective bargaining being undertaken, particularly in the petroleum industry. The draft Constitution then being examined by the National Constituent Assembly contained clauses guaranteeing freedom of association, recognising the right to strike, authorising collective agreements, etc.Conclusions of the Committee in Its Sixth Report
.The Committee, after noting that from the information presented by the Government there appeared to have been some improvement in the trade union situation as a whole, formulated conclusions with reference to the two principal allegations.
.With regard to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Committee, after finding that "" the penalties provided for under the Labour Code in case of strikes called in violation of the legislation in force were imposed only on the persons actually responsible for the strikes but not upon the trade union organisations "", concluded:
.The Committee, on the basis of the actual facts of the case, found that the dissolution of the oilworkers' union had not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of article .
.The Committee reached the same conclusion with respect to article , which provides that an industrial association should not be affiliated to or associated with a national or foreign political group, a fact which has never been proven.
.With reference to the allegations relating to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Committee reached the following conclusions:
.The Committee therefore considers that the explanations given by the Government have not invalidated the conclusion which the Committee reached at its meeting in January , namely that the oilworkers' unions were dissolved by administrative action.
.The Committee has nevertheless taken account of the new information communicated by the Government in its reply of  May . This information tends to show that the situation in the petroleum industry has again become normal. The Government emphasises the fact that the oilworkers' unions, which had been dissolved in , have been reconstituted in the same districts and with the same membership. Furthermore, the Government points out that the collective agreements concluded in  were kept in force and that, if it was forced to intervene in the negotiations between the employers and the unions, it was in the interest of the workers themselves, as the Government has succeeded in getting better working conditions embodied in the collective agreements. Finally, the Government has called upon the representatives of the trade unions to collaborate with the authorities and the employers in various bodies set up in the petroleum industry.
.It therefore appears that the oilworkers' unions have been enabled to be reconstituted and are in a position to carry on their functions normally.
.With respect to the allegations relating to the trade union situation in general, the Committee reached the following conclusions, which were approved by the Governing Body when it adopted the Sixth Report of the Committee at its st Session:
.From its examination of the case as a whole, the Committee has reached the following conclusions:
.In conclusion, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to express the hope that the discussions on the measures necessary to secure a fuller application of the principles of freedom of association which have been taking place between the Venezuelan Government and the national and international trade union organisations concerned will be continued, and, in this connection, to decide to draw the attention of the Government of Venezuela to the desirability of:(i) taking appropriate measures to ensure to employers and workers full freedom to form, within the limits of the law, organisations of their own choosing and to join such organisations ;(ii) re-examining the cases of trade union leaders who are stated still to be in custody under the provisions of emergency legislation, in order to ensure that no person shall, without having had the benefit of the guarantees afforded by normal judicial procedure, be deprived of his freedom because of his membership of a trade union or of his lawful trade union activities ;(iii) re-examining the legal provisions at present in force with respect to employers' and workers' organisations in order to bring them into harmony with the principles laid down in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  and, in particular, the provisions relating to the cancellation of the registration of trade unions and to the dissolution of trade unions by administrative authority.OBSERVATIONS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA ON CERTAIN OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE IN CASE No. .In a communication dated  October  the Government of Venezuela transmitted a study made by the Ministry of Labour containing a comparison between the recommendations put forward by the Committee in subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of paragraph  of its Sixth Report and the legal provisions in force in Venezuela.
.In a communication dated  October  the Government of Venezuela transmitted a study made by the Ministry of Labour containing a comparison between the recommendations put forward by the Committee in subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of paragraph  of its Sixth Report and the legal provisions in force in Venezuela.
.With reference to the first recommendation concerning the desirability of taking appropriate measures to ensure to employers and workers full freedom to form, within the limits of the law, organisations of their own choosing and to join such organisations, the Government cites article  of its Labour Law, which accords the right to form industrial associations to persons of either sex in the same undertaking or in the same trade or occupation or in similar or related trades or occupations whether of an intellectual or manual character. Article  provides that industrial associations may be composed of employers, salaried employees or wage-earning employees or both, or persons engaged in liberal professions or independent occupations. Articles  and  prohibit various acts of interference by the authorities in the operation of trade unions and acts of anti-union discrimination. The Government declares that these provisions not only implement the principles enunciated in the Committee's recommendations but go beyond them, and that the application of the provisions of the Labour Law is effectively ensured by the Ministry of Labour being made responsible for its enforcement and by the labour inspectors being given the duty of seeing that the provisions of the Law are complied with in their areas of jurisdiction.
.With respect to the recommendation in subparagraph (iii) of paragraph  of the Committee's Sixth Report as to the desirability of the Government re-examining its legislation with a view to bringing it into harmony with the principles laid down",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
350,"in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Government explains the position in Venezuela as follows. With respect to the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , the Government considers that the principle of Article  thereof is applied by articles , ,  and  of the Labour Law referred to above, and that the right of associations to draw up their Constitutions and rules (Article  of the Convention) is provided for in articles ,  and  of the Labour Law, the duty of the labour inspectors to examine the Constitution and rules of an association being intended solely to verify the lawfulness of the organisation's Constitution, in conformity with Article  of the Convention and, therefore, being calculated to protect and not to impair the guarantees of freedom of association. The right to form federations and Confederations (Article  of the Convention) is embodied in article  of the Labour Law and regulated in detail in articles  and .
.Trade unions are prohibited from federating with political associations or parties affiliated thereto. Under article  of the Law, the Federal Government shall lay down rules to govern all matters connected with employers' or employees' Conventions or congresses.
.The definition of "" organisations "" as organisations for furthering or defending the interest of workers or employers (Article  of the Convention) is met by the definition of the objects of industrial associations contained in article  of the Law, while the undertaking to ensure that the right to organise is freely exercised (Article  of the Convention) is implemented by the provisions in Venezuelan law making the labour authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with legal provisions. The principle of industrial associations not being liable to administrative dissolution or suspension (Article  of the Convention) is applied, in the Government's view, by the fact that when dissolution occurs as an exceptional measure by order of the administrative authorities, the trade unions have a right of appeal to the Federal Chamber of the Court of Appeal.
.Finally, the provision in Article  of the Convention concerning its application to the armed forces and police is in accordance with the provision in the Labour Law (article ) excluding from its application members of the armed forces and officials and salaried employees in public service.
.With respect to the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Government relates its commentary to the principles as to the protection of workers against anti-union discrimination (Article ), the protection of workers' and employers' organisations against acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members (Article ), the establishment of machinery to ensure respect for the right to organise (Article ), and the taking of measures, where necessary, to encourage and promote the development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation. With these provisions the Government compares a number of provisions in the Venezuelan Labour Law which prohibit acts of interference with the operation of trade unions and the exercise of the right to organise (articles  and ) ; article  lays down, among other things, that the aims of industrial associations shall be to conclude collective agreements and to uphold their members' rights under such agreements and to represent their members in labour negotiation, conciliation and arbitration. Article  affords protection against dismissal or prejudice to the intending founders of trade unions and members of trade union executive committees except in cases where the labour inspector decides, on the evidence, that a particular dismissal is reasonable. Article  obliges an employer whose employees are organised to conclude a collective agreement if requested by the workers concerned. Finally, the Government refers to the provisions in articles  and  ensuring the continuity of application of a collective agreement if an employer ceases to be affiliated to the contracting employers' association or if a contracting union or group of employees is dissolved. The Government claims that these provisions in the Labour Law embody and even go beyond the corresponding provisions contained in the said Convention.
.At its Seventh Session (November ) the Committee examined the observations presented by the Government of Venezuela and considered that they did not contain any elements which should cause it to modify the conclusions formulated in its Sixth Report (paragraphs  and ). Whereas the partial observations presented by the Government of Venezuela consisted in the main of a comparative analysis of the provisions of international Conventions relating to freedom of association and the Venezuelan legal system, the conclusions of the Committee in its Sixth Report related exclusively to a situation of fact in respect of which no new elements of information had been presented by the Government of Venezuela.
.Having regard to these considerations, the Committee, while thanking the Government of Venezuela for its observations, considers that they do not call for any modification of the conclusions formulated in paragraph  of its Sixth Report.FURTHER COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS, THE INTER-AMERICAN REGIONAL ORGANISATION OF WORKERS, THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS, THE PERUVIAN PETROLEUM WORKERS' FEDERATION, THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHOREMEN'S AND WAREHOUSEMEN'S UNION (SAN FRANCISCO), THE TRADE UNION INTERNATIONAL OF WORKERS IN THE CHEMICALS PETROLEUM AND ALLIED INDUSTRIES AND THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF CHRISTIAN TRADE UNIONS
.Subsequent to the adoption of its Sixth Report the Committee received a number of complaints of violations of trade union rights in Venezuela with respect to which it has not had the opportunity of reporting to the Governing Body. The first, dated  December , was presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O. The second, dated  April , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers. The third, dated  March , was presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O. The fourth, dated  October , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation. The fifth, dated  November , was presented to the Secretary-General of the United Nations by the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (San Francisco) and referred by him to the I.L.O. The sixth, dated  January , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries. Finally, the seventh, dated  June , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions. These complaints are analysed separately in the following pages.Complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (Communication dated  December )Analysis of the Complaint
.In its complaint, the I.C.F.T.U, after referring to the Venezuelan general elections in , stated that the people of Venezuela "" has courageously affirmed its existence in spite of the suppression of the rights of the workers and of freedom of association."". The complainant demanded a thorough investigation into the violations of trade union rights in Venezuela.
.As the complaint of the I.C.F.T.U contained allegations of a general character similar to those already examined in its Sixth Report, the Committee, at its meeting on  June , decided to communicate the complaint to the Venezuelan Government for information, in the light of the recommendations approved by the Governing Body.Analysis of the Reply (Communication dated  October )
.In this communication the Government confirmed the observations which it had made with respect to the Sixth Report of the Committee, and declared, with respect to this complaint and to the complaint presented on  April  by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers, that in no case had the activities of legally constituted trade union organisations been restricted ; the Government firmly defended the rights of trade union organisations provided that they acted within the limits of their legally specified duties.Complaints of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (Communication dated  April ), the World Federation of Trade Unions (Communication dated  March ) and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (Communication dated  November )Analysis of the Complaints
.On the basis of a letter of protest from Mr. Augusto Malav Villalba, General Secretary of the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers, which is affiliated to the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (I.R.O.W), the complaint presented by the latter organisation alleged that, in spite of the efforts made by the I.L.O, following repeated complaints, to persuade the Venezuelan Government to fully recognise trade union rights, the Government was still pursuing a policy of repression of trade unions. Hundreds of trade union leaders were still in prison, including, in particular, Mr. Prez Salinas, the President of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation. Mr. Ramn Quijada, the General Secretary of the Confederation, responsible for agricultural questions and deputy of Mr. Prez Salinas, had also been arrested.
.The complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
351,"(W.F.T.U.) alleged that Mr. Federico Rondn, a member of the Central Committee of the Confederation of Latin American Workers, was arrested on  December  on his return from the Third World Trade Union Congress (W.F.T.U.) and subjected to brutal torture. His wife was also arbitrarily imprisoned. The complaint emphasised that no charge had been brought against Mr. Federico Rondn and that he left the country in October  with a regular passport issued by the Government of Venezuela. The complaint also protested against the arrest, on  February , of Mr. Rodolfo Quintero, President of the Federation of Workers for the Federal District and the State of Miranda, although no valid charge had been or could be brought against him.
.The complaint of the W.F.T.U presented a series of allegations concerning measures taken by the authorities against the Union of Petroleum Workers in the Ribas and Zaraza districts. According to the complainant, a collective agreement similar to the one concluded between the main petrol companies and the "" Independent Trade Union Movement "", an organisation controlled by the Government, was signed on  September  by the Atlantic Refining Company and the executive committee of the above-mentioned union in the presence of the regional delegates of the Ministry of Labour. The signature was ratified in the presence of the civil authorities at Caracas in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. At that meeting, in accordance with the decisions reached by the Union Assembly held on  September , the members of the executive committee lodged a written protest against the conditions under which the agreement had been forced upon them. This protest was made public on  October. On the same day, they were imprisoned and the union offices were searched by the police. Six days later some of them were set free and the civil authorities gave them documents stating that they had been held in preventive detention and were not guilty of any crime. The other members of the executive committee (Claudio Chacn, Fernando Bolivar, Ramn Lozada and Carlos Laza) were detained for  days, then dismissed from their employment with the consent of the labour inspectorate. Later they were taken to the Gurico State prison. The secretary of the union, Mr. Rafael Castillo, one of the leaders who had been released, was forced to draw up an inventory of the assets of the union and to leave the union under the threat of prosecution. On  October the funds and documents of the union were seized by the police ; on  October, the labour inspectorate gave the local delegate of the Ministry of Labour a document attesting that, at a meeting held on  October, the workers had decided to dissolve the union and hand over all its funds to the independent trade union. In actual fact, declared the complainant, no such meeting ever took place, but the authorities attempted to give some show of legality to the arbitrary dissolution of the union and the transfer of its funds to the Government-controlled trade union by forcing the workers, under threats of imprisonment, to sign the document. The complainant considered that these facts clearly showed that the administrative and police authorities had openly interfered in the functioning of a trade union organisation and had attempted to destroy it. By a letter dated  June  the W.F.T.U was informed that, in accordance with the procedure in force, it might furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month. In a letter dated  July  the W.F.T.U stated that, in its view, the facts cited in its original complaint convincingly established the infringements of the exercise of trade union rights committed in Venezuela.
.The complaint presented by the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (San Francisco) protested against the arrest, in order to impede their trade union activities, of several Venezuelan trade union leaders and, in particular, Messrs. Jess Faria, Federico Rondn, Luis Emiro Arrieta and Alicedes Hurtado. On being informed that, according to the procedure in force, it was entitled to present further information within one month, the complaining organisation stated, in a letter dated  January , that in its view it was not necessary to furnish proof in support of the facts alleged in the complaint because the Government had not refuted the allegations made against it and because the persons mentioned in the original complaint were still in prison.Analysis of the Government's Replies (Communications dated  October ,  February  and  October )Communication dated  October 
.In this communication, relating also to the I.C.F.T.U complaint of  December  analysed above, the Venezuelan Government presented its observations on the complaint submitted by the I.R.O.W.
.In no case had workers been the victims of repressive acts on grounds of trade union membership or activities. Workers belonging to trade union organisations sanctioned in the past in accordance with the Labour Law were not subject to disability and many, and in some cases all, of the workers who had belonged to unions dissolved on legal grounds had joined existing trade unions or created new ones. The measures taken by the Government, including measures taken to maintain public order, were based on Constitutional provisions and the Government denied that international organisations were competent to discuss them because such discussion would mean an infringement of the national sovereignty of Venezuela.First request for further information. . At its Seventh Session (November ), the Committee, while noting with satisfaction the assurances given by the Government in its communication of  October  that it had not interfered with the activities of trade union organisations and that the organised workers had not been subjected to repressive measures because of their trade union affiliation, observed that the Government gave no information with reference to the allegation that certain trade union leaders had been arrested. The Committee consequently decided, before examining the case as a whole, to request the Director-General to ask the Venezuelan Government for more detailed information on the imprisonment of the trade union leaders mentioned in the communication of  April  from the I.R.O.W. This request was conveyed to the Venezuelan Government by the Director-General in a letter dated  December .Communication dated  February 
.In this communication the Venezuelan Government referred to its first reply and reaffirmed that not only did it not place any restriction on the activity of legally constituted trade union organisations, but that on the contrary one of the principles of its social policy was to protect the rights of trade unions in so far as they confined their activity to the functions assigned to them by law.
.In connection with the arrest of Mr. Prez Salinas and Mr. Ramn Quijada, the Government contended that those persons were no longer trade union leaders. The Venezuelan Workers' Confederation and its affiliated organisations were dissolved by Executive Decree No. , dated  February , which was subsequently ratified by the National Constituent Assembly of the United States of Venezuela when it approved the reports of the Ministry of Labour. Consequently, a complaint relating to a violation of trade union rights could not be based, according to the Government, on the detention of persons who were no longer trade union leaders. Similarly, Mr. Augusto Malav Villalba could no longer lay claim to the title of General Secretary of a Confederation which ceased to exist nearly four years before.
.The Government stated, more specifically, that Mr. Prez Saunas and Mr. Ramn Quijada were arrested for illegal activities punishable by law, which not only had no connection with trade union activities but were, on the contrary, quite incompatible with such activities. The Government considered that these acts were all the more serious as attempts were made to conceal them under cover of trade union activities and thus to obtain for them the protection given by law to these activities.
.The Government concluded by emphasising that, under the powers granted to it by the Constitution, it alone was entitled to decide the course of action to be followed in relation to the persons in question and reaffirmed that the measures taken to maintain public order were not matters which could be discussed by international organisations because "" to accept such a course would mean an infringement of the principles of national sovereignty "".Second request for further information. . At its Eighth Session (March ) and at its Ninth Session (May ), the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the above complaints in the hope of receiving certain further information from the Government of Venezuela on the I.R.O.W complaint and observations on the complaint of the W.F.T.U, dated  March , communicated to the Government by a letter dated  July .Communication dated  October 
.In this communication the Venezuelan Government presented further observations concerning the complaint of the W.F.T.U and the further information requested by the Committee with reference to the complaint of the I.R.O.W.
.With reference to the allegations of the W.F.T.U relating to the arrest",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
352,"of Mr. Federico Rondn and Mr. Rodolfo Quintero, the Government declared that, although these two persons were known to be Communist leaders and although the Communist Party was dissolved by Decree No.  of  May , they continued, while occupying their positions as trade unionists, to enjoy the rights which labour legislation and the authorities accorded to all workers in Venezuela. The facts which occasioned the measures taken with respect to these two persons had no relation whatever with their status as trade unionists, and the Government repeated its earlier statement to the effect that the measures which it took to protect social tranquillity and the security of the State in the exercise of its Constitutional powers could not be the subject of discussion by any international organ.
.With regard to the allegation of the W.F.T.U relating to the dissolution of the trade union of petroleum workers of the district of Ribas and Zaraza and the detention of the members of its executive committee, the Government declared that the situation of this trade union was carefully examined by the competent officials of the Ministry of Labour and its registration was cancelled because it did not fulfil the requirements laid down in article  of the Labour Law, which provides that trade unions shall not continue to exist if they do not have the number of members required under article  of the same Law. Everything done with respect to the cancellation of the registration of the trade union concerned, including the disposal to be made of its funds and property, was carried out in accordance with the provisions of labour legislation and is shown in the relevant records, in accordance with the communication dated  October  addressed to the Labour Inspector of the State of Gurico by the members of the Winding-Up Committee, Messrs. Gabriel Ramirez, Finance Secretary of the trade union concerned, Rafael Castillo, Secretary, and Luis Pedro Alvarez. The assembly which decided on the winding-up of the trade union and the appointment of the above-mentioned Winding-Up Committee was held at Tucupido, capital of the district of Ribas, on  October , according to the record drawn up on that occasion. On  October , the Winding-Up Committee agreed to transfer the remaining property to the trade union of employees and workers of the petroleum industry and related industries of the State of Gurico, in pursuance of the decision of the above-mentioned assembly, since the majority of the workers belonging to the trade union that was being wound up had joined this union. Only obligations contracted by the trade union were deducted from the funds remaining, including the advance granted by the Executive Committee with respect to the travel expenses to Vienna in October  of Mr. Luis A. Snchez, General Secretary of the trade union, who attended the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Government observed that the trade union of petroleum workers of the districts of Ribas and Zaraza of the State of Gurico could not legally continue in existence since it had decided upon its liquidation. This was the decision of the plenary assembly which was held normally on the date mentioned above. Moreover, the workers who composed the trade union that was being wound up became members of other trade union organisations. The Government added that the documents to which reference was made were at the disposal of the Committee.
.With regard to the request for further information with reference to the complaint presented by the I.R.O.W, the Government declared that it had already furnished its observations and had no further information to offer.Complaints of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation (Communication dated  November ) and the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries (Communication dated  January )Analysis of the Complaints
.The complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation, based also on a communication from the Venezuelan Confederation of Labour in exile, contained a request to the I.L.O, prior to any inquiry which might appear appropriate, to make representations to the Government of Venezuela to secure the re-establishment of freedom of association, so that the Fifth Session of the Petroleum Committee, due to be held in Caracas in the summer of , might take place in an atmosphere of freedom.
.The complaint of the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries, also presented very shortly before the pending meeting in Caracas of the Petroleum Committee, contained allegations of a general nature relating to violations of freedom of association in Venezuela and asked for measures to be taken to secure the liberation of imprisoned trade unionists, the closing of concentration camps, respect for freedom of association and the ending of violent police action and of governmental interference with the functioning of trade unions.
.The complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation was communicated to the Government of Venezuela on  December . The complaining organisation was informed on  November  of its right to present further information, but did not avail itself of this right. With regard to the complaint of  January  from the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries, the Committee decided, at its th Session (May ), not to transmit this complaint to the Government of Venezuela because it did not contain any specific new allegations not already contained in complaints transmitted previously.
.The Government of Venezuela has not presented any observations on the complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation.Complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (Communications dated  June  and  September )Analysis of the Complaint
.In its communication dated  June  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions stated that its executive committee had decided to regard the communication dated  April  from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions as a complaint alleging violation of trade union rights presented to the I.L.O in its name. In this communication, the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions alleges a number of events "" which amount to flagrant and intolerable persecution of the free trade union movement completely at variance with the undertaking to preserve liberty given by Venezuela "". The General Secretary of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V (Committee for the Federation of the Organised Workers of Venezuela), Mr. Elio Aponte, is alleged to have been arrested on his return to Venezuela after the First Congress of the Latin American Christian Trade Union Movement, held in Santiago in . On  February  the leaders of the Christian Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P) at Cabimas (Zulia State) were summoned by the local Labour Commissioner. This official demanded to see the account books and invited the members of the union executive to join the trade unions of the Independent Trade Union Movement, affiliated to the government-sponsored National Workers' Confederation. They did not accept this invitation, which would have implied the loss of the independence of the trade union, and the same day the trade union premises were invaded by persons who were not members of the union and who were led by leaders of the Independent Trade Union Movement. The Labour Commissioner, who was also present, stated that the fusion of the two organisations should take place at once. Mr. Csar Vergel Lozano, a representative of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, refused to accept this arbitrary command ; the premises were then occupied by force and all the goods and property of the union, including a considerable quantity of cash, were confiscated.
.The following day, representatives of the Independent Trade Union Movement took similar action against the Union of Organised Oilworkers (U.T.O.P) of Bachaquero (Zulia State), also a Christian trade union. The property of this union was transferred to the local police station. The Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P), in the Simn Rodriguez district of Anzotegui State, another affiliate of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, was also subjected to action of a similar kind, and Mr. Francisco Fernndez, a representative of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, and its executive committee were detained. The Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P) of the Sotillo district of Anzotegui State is alleged to have been treated in the same way.
.In the name of the Independent Petroleum Workers' Union, an affiliate of the Independent Trade Union Movement, threats were publicly made on  February  against the S.T.O.P Oilworkers' Union branches in Carirubana, Los Taques and Punto Cardn, in the Falcn district of Falcn State. These threats have been carried out, various leaders of these trade unions having been attacked.
.C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V lodged a complaint (without any result) with the Minister of Labour against these attacks, because it is alleged that officials of the Ministry of Labour in the different localities had helped the persons concerned in making the attacks.
.The International Federation of Christian Trade Unions was informed of its right to furnish further information and did so by a communication dated  September . By the same communication it transmitted photo-copies of documents emanating from the Direction of the Cabinet of the Ministry of Labour of Venezuela and from the National Executive Committee of the Independent Trade",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
353,"Union Movement. The first document states that Mr. Temilio A. Chirinos "" carries out special missions in relation to trade union matters on the orders of the Ministry of Labour "". The second document states that the same person is authorised to represent the executive committee of the Independent Trade Union Movement in all the transactions which it may be required to perform before the civil and military authorities of the State. In the complaint in question it is specifically stated that elements of the Independent Trade Union Movement, commissioned for this purpose by the Department, have exercised repression against Christian trade union organisations. In the opinion of the complainant, the documents presented prove that the Ministry of Labour has entrusted "" special missions in trade union affairs "" to persons acting as officers of the Independent Trade Union Movement. This implies, the complainant continues, a clear intervention by the Government in trade union affairs and demonstrates the collaboration existing between the Government and the Independent Trade Union Movement.
.The communications from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions were transmitted to the Government of Venezuela by a communication dated  November . So far, the Government of Venezuela has not transmitted any observations on this complaint.
.In the light of the foregoing facts and circumstances the Committee considers that it has fulfilled its responsibility for making a preliminary examination of the matter and it now transmits the case to the Governing Body for consideration of the action to be taken and of the advisability of possibly referring the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission.Geneva,  June . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
354,".The Committee had occasion to submit conclusions to the Governing Body on a number of complaints relating to alleged violation of trade union rights in Venezuela in its First and Sixth Reports. A brief summary of these is given below.Complaints of the American Federation of Labor and, the Venezuelan General Confederation of Labour
.These complaints, analysed in the First Report of the Committee related to the general situation of the trade union movement in Venezuela following the assumption of power by a Military Junta on  November . The trade union movement was alleged to have been the subject of a campaign of repression culminating in the dissolution, by administrative action, of the Venezuelan General Federation of Labour and its affiliated federations of trade unions. Many trade union leaders were stated to have been imprisoned ; it was alleged that trade union premises were closed and the goods of all the dissolved associations seized. The trade union press was suppressed ; workers were persecuted on the pretext of participation in subversive political activities. The remaining trade union organisations which were not then dissolved were alleged to have been obliged, by ministerial order, to renew their executive bodies, the former officials being declared ineligible for re-election.
.The remaining allegations related to the dissolution of  petroleum workers' organisations-again by administrative action. The reason for this dissolution is alleged to have been a strike in the oilfields. The workers are alleged to have been subjected to measures of repression, including the incarceration of more than , of them.
.With regard to these two allegations, the Government presented a number of observations' to the effect that the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour was ordered because of the participation of that organisation in an illegal political strike. The Government took this measure only when it was apparent that the Confederation had been turned into an instrument for political agitation, its unlawful activities having culminated in the presentation of an ultimatum to the Government on  February  threatening resort to direct action. In the face of such a challenge the Government proceeded to dissolve the organisation. The illegal character of the activities of the Confederation contravened the provisions of the Labour Code and the regulations issued under it relating to the procedure laid down for initiating collective disputes. The freezing of trade union funds was ordered so as to prevent them being used for purposes foreign to trade union activity. The detention of trade union leaders, ordered as a security measure, was a measure taken exclusively on the ground of their political activities.
.With regard to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Government stated that this dissolution was ordered because the unions concerned ordered a strike contrary to formal provisions contained in the collective agreements then in force. The sanctions taken for illegal strikes were based on provisions of the Labour Code and the Government considered that similar measures had been taken in other countries and had not, in its view, constituted an infringement of freedom of association. According to the Government, a considerable number of the petroleum workers' unions subsequently reorganised and initiated new collective agreements.Conclusions of the Committee in Its First Report
.In its First Report the Committee adopted the following conclusions:
.With regard to the allegations relating to the general situation of the trade union movement in Venezuela, the Governing Body has at its disposal the report of the I.L.O Mission to Venezuela and the observations of the Government of Venezuela on the same report. The data necessary for appreciating the position are therefore available.
.The dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, to which the second part of the complaint relates, took place after the events dealt with in the above documents and have therefore not been the subject of any similar examination. The versions given by the Government and by the complainants differ considerably with regard to the circumstances under which the events took place which gave rise to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, but they are in agreement as to the dissolution having actually taken place. It is quite clear from the text of the dissolution decree attached to the complaint that the measure was taken by the administrative authorities without the case first having been submitted to the competent courts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends that the case merits further examination by the Governing Body.
.With respect to the future policy to be followed, the Committee made the following pronouncement in the same report:
.The Venezuelan Government has not been formally requested to indicate whether it would be willing to consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission. Under the procedure laid down by the Governing Body this question does not arise until the Governing Body itself has decided that the Government concerned shall be asked to give its consent to reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding Commission. Although the Government has indicated in its preliminary observations on the complaint that it would not be willing to consent to such reference, the Committee does not consider that such a preliminary reply precludes the Governing Body from discussing further whether it is advisable to make a formal request to the Government concerned that it should consent to reference of a case to the Fact-Finding Commission. They venture to hope that in future cases the preliminary observations of governments will not anticipate any request which the Governing Body may or may not think it appropriate to make after it has had an opportunity of considering the facts of the case and expressing its views ....Decision of the Committee Contained in Its Third Report
.The conclusions adopted in its First Report were amended by the Committee in its Third Report, as follows:
.The Committee also had before it a letter from Mr. Montoya, Venezuelan Government representative on the Governing Body, informing the Committee that he had further observations to present on behalf of his Government relating to Case No.  (Venezuela). Under these circumstances, the Committee decided to amend the recommendation which it had submitted to the Governing Body in its First Report and, accordingly, recommends the Governing Body to postpone examination of this case in order to enable the Venezuelan Government to transmit its supplementary observations to the Committee. The Committee will report further on this case to the Governing Body when the observations in question have been transmitted to it.
.The Governing Body, at its th Session (Geneva, March ), considered the First and Third Reports of the Committee and decided to postpone the examination of the case.Complaints of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and Other Trade Union Organisations
.In the meantime, a complaint dated  April  was received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and communicated to the Government of Venezuela which confirmed and supplemented similar complaints against the Government of Venezuela presented to the Economic and Social Council by various trade union organisations.
.These complaints which, in part, repeat the allegations made in the earlier communications from the American Federation of Labor and the Venezuelan Confederation of Labour, related especially to the dissolution of various trade unions in  and to the dissolution of the petroleum industry trade unions in . They also alleged the detention of trade union leaders.
.With respect to these new complaints, as with respect to the earlier complaints, the Government presented a series of observations in separate communications forming a continuous whole and, through its representative, presented verbal statements at the Committee's meeting on  June .
.In its communication dated  May  the Government stated that there had been important developments in the trade union situation in Venezuela. Since January  a large number of trade unions had been legally constituted and by the middle of  there existed a total of  trade unions and four federations. In the view of the Government, these figures demonstrated that the Government favoured the development of trade unionism but did not mean that it could tolerate the affiliation of trade union organisations to national or foreign political parties or their engaging in political activities foreign to the purposes expressly assigned to them by the Labour Law. The exercise of the right of meeting had also been facilitated, previous authorisation no longer being required. The number of collective agreements had increased appreciably between  and . In particular, the Government had paid particular attention to negotiations in the petroleum industry, the Ministry of Labour having obtained from the petroleum undertakings a promise not to alter working conditions during the negotiation of the new contracts. The Government had given aid to the trade union organisations by assuming the costs of premises and materials. With reference to the freezing of the funds of the dissolved organisations, the administrative commission charged with administration of the funds had returned a considerable sum to new trade unions formed by workers who had belonged to the dissolved organisations. Each case of devolution of funds had been thoroughly studied.
.In the same communication, the Government analysed the jurisprudence of the Committee",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
355,"on Freedom of Association in other cases, particularly with respect to Case No.  concerning the complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions against the Government of the United Kingdom (Cyprus). The Government considered that the complaints presented against the Government of Venezuela were similar to those examined in Case No. , dealing with associations of a clearly political character.
.In a second communication of the same date,  May , the Government of Venezuela called attention to the report of the Credentials Committee of the th Session of the International Labour Conference. In that report, the Credentials Committee recommended the rejection of the protest presented against the credentials of the Venezuelan Workers' delegate to the Conference.
.In the statements presented verbally by the representative of the Venezuelan Government at the meeting of the Committee on  June , the Government declared that the strike which had led to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions was, from the juridical point of view, an illegal movement, because the trade unions which caused it were bound by collective agreements. The Government had warned the trade unions of this before it proceeded to dissolve them, but in view of their refusal to take heed, the Government found itself obliged to dissolve the trade unions in order to maintain production in the petroleum industry which was vital to the country.
.In its later communications, dated  November ,  November  and  February , the Government repeated its earlier statements, because it considered that the new complaints which had been transmitted to it-the complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and similar complaints-did not contain any new allegations. The Government transmitted to the Committee the text of a speech made by the President of the Government Junta on the eve of the elections on  November , in which he stated that the policy of the Venezuelan Government was to re-establish in the country a Constitutional rgime expressed through the will of the people. In its last communication, dated  February , the Government presented a memorandum on the evolution of the trade union situation. It stated that the Ministry of Labour had adopted a liberal policy and that no restrictive measure had been taken against the trade union movement. With the creation of new trade unions in various regions of the country the ground was prepared for the Constitution of a national Confederation. The freedom of action enjoyed by the trade unions was demonstrated by the extensive amount of collective bargaining being undertaken, particularly in the petroleum industry. The draft Constitution then being examined by the National Constituent Assembly contained clauses guaranteeing freedom of association, recognising the right to strike, authorising collective agreements, etc.Conclusions of the Committee in Its Sixth Report
.The Committee, after noting that from the information presented by the Government there appeared to have been some improvement in the trade union situation as a whole, formulated conclusions with reference to the two principal allegations.
.With regard to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Committee, after finding that "" the penalties provided for under the Labour Code in case of strikes called in violation of the legislation in force were imposed only on the persons actually responsible for the strikes but not upon the trade union organisations "", concluded:
.The Committee, on the basis of the actual facts of the case, found that the dissolution of the oilworkers' union had not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of article .
.The Committee reached the same conclusion with respect to article , which provides that an industrial association should not be affiliated to or associated with a national or foreign political group, a fact which has never been proven.
.With reference to the allegations relating to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, the Committee reached the following conclusions:
.The Committee therefore considers that the explanations given by the Government have not invalidated the conclusion which the Committee reached at its meeting in January , namely that the oilworkers' unions were dissolved by administrative action.
.The Committee has nevertheless taken account of the new information communicated by the Government in its reply of  May . This information tends to show that the situation in the petroleum industry has again become normal. The Government emphasises the fact that the oilworkers' unions, which had been dissolved in , have been reconstituted in the same districts and with the same membership. Furthermore, the Government points out that the collective agreements concluded in  were kept in force and that, if it was forced to intervene in the negotiations between the employers and the unions, it was in the interest of the workers themselves, as the Government has succeeded in getting better working conditions embodied in the collective agreements. Finally, the Government has called upon the representatives of the trade unions to collaborate with the authorities and the employers in various bodies set up in the petroleum industry.
.It therefore appears that the oilworkers' unions have been enabled to be reconstituted and are in a position to carry on their functions normally.
.With respect to the allegations relating to the trade union situation in general, the Committee reached the following conclusions, which were approved by the Governing Body when it adopted the Sixth Report of the Committee at its st Session:
.From its examination of the case as a whole, the Committee has reached the following conclusions:
.In conclusion, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to express the hope that the discussions on the measures necessary to secure a fuller application of the principles of freedom of association which have been taking place between the Venezuelan Government and the national and international trade union organisations concerned will be continued, and, in this connection, to decide to draw the attention of the Government of Venezuela to the desirability of:(i) taking appropriate measures to ensure to employers and workers full freedom to form, within the limits of the law, organisations of their own choosing and to join such organisations ;(ii) re-examining the cases of trade union leaders who are stated still to be in custody under the provisions of emergency legislation, in order to ensure that no person shall, without having had the benefit of the guarantees afforded by normal judicial procedure, be deprived of his freedom because of his membership of a trade union or of his lawful trade union activities ;(iii) re-examining the legal provisions at present in force with respect to employers' and workers' organisations in order to bring them into harmony with the principles laid down in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  and, in particular, the provisions relating to the cancellation of the registration of trade unions and to the dissolution of trade unions by administrative authority.OBSERVATIONS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA ON CERTAIN OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE IN CASE No. .In a communication dated  October  the Government of Venezuela transmitted a study made by the Ministry of Labour containing a comparison between the recommendations put forward by the Committee in subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of paragraph  of its Sixth Report and the legal provisions in force in Venezuela.
.In a communication dated  October  the Government of Venezuela transmitted a study made by the Ministry of Labour containing a comparison between the recommendations put forward by the Committee in subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of paragraph  of its Sixth Report and the legal provisions in force in Venezuela.
.With reference to the first recommendation concerning the desirability of taking appropriate measures to ensure to employers and workers full freedom to form, within the limits of the law, organisations of their own choosing and to join such organisations, the Government cites article  of its Labour Law, which accords the right to form industrial associations to persons of either sex in the same undertaking or in the same trade or occupation or in similar or related trades or occupations whether of an intellectual or manual character. Article  provides that industrial associations may be composed of employers, salaried employees or wage-earning employees or both, or persons engaged in liberal professions or independent occupations. Articles  and  prohibit various acts of interference by the authorities in the operation of trade unions and acts of anti-union discrimination. The Government declares that these provisions not only implement the principles enunciated in the Committee's recommendations but go beyond them, and that the application of the provisions of the Labour Law is effectively ensured by the Ministry of Labour being made responsible for its enforcement and by the labour inspectors being given the duty of seeing that the provisions of the Law are complied with in their areas of jurisdiction.
.With respect to the recommendation in subparagraph (iii) of paragraph  of the Committee's Sixth Report as to the desirability of the Government re-examining its legislation with a view to bringing it into harmony with the principles laid down",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
356,"in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Government explains the position in Venezuela as follows. With respect to the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , the Government considers that the principle of Article  thereof is applied by articles , ,  and  of the Labour Law referred to above, and that the right of associations to draw up their Constitutions and rules (Article  of the Convention) is provided for in articles ,  and  of the Labour Law, the duty of the labour inspectors to examine the Constitution and rules of an association being intended solely to verify the lawfulness of the organisation's Constitution, in conformity with Article  of the Convention and, therefore, being calculated to protect and not to impair the guarantees of freedom of association. The right to form federations and Confederations (Article  of the Convention) is embodied in article  of the Labour Law and regulated in detail in articles  and .
.Trade unions are prohibited from federating with political associations or parties affiliated thereto. Under article  of the Law, the Federal Government shall lay down rules to govern all matters connected with employers' or employees' Conventions or congresses.
.The definition of "" organisations "" as organisations for furthering or defending the interest of workers or employers (Article  of the Convention) is met by the definition of the objects of industrial associations contained in article  of the Law, while the undertaking to ensure that the right to organise is freely exercised (Article  of the Convention) is implemented by the provisions in Venezuelan law making the labour authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with legal provisions. The principle of industrial associations not being liable to administrative dissolution or suspension (Article  of the Convention) is applied, in the Government's view, by the fact that when dissolution occurs as an exceptional measure by order of the administrative authorities, the trade unions have a right of appeal to the Federal Chamber of the Court of Appeal.
.Finally, the provision in Article  of the Convention concerning its application to the armed forces and police is in accordance with the provision in the Labour Law (article ) excluding from its application members of the armed forces and officials and salaried employees in public service.
.With respect to the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Government relates its commentary to the principles as to the protection of workers against anti-union discrimination (Article ), the protection of workers' and employers' organisations against acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members (Article ), the establishment of machinery to ensure respect for the right to organise (Article ), and the taking of measures, where necessary, to encourage and promote the development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation. With these provisions the Government compares a number of provisions in the Venezuelan Labour Law which prohibit acts of interference with the operation of trade unions and the exercise of the right to organise (articles  and ) ; article  lays down, among other things, that the aims of industrial associations shall be to conclude collective agreements and to uphold their members' rights under such agreements and to represent their members in labour negotiation, conciliation and arbitration. Article  affords protection against dismissal or prejudice to the intending founders of trade unions and members of trade union executive committees except in cases where the labour inspector decides, on the evidence, that a particular dismissal is reasonable. Article  obliges an employer whose employees are organised to conclude a collective agreement if requested by the workers concerned. Finally, the Government refers to the provisions in articles  and  ensuring the continuity of application of a collective agreement if an employer ceases to be affiliated to the contracting employers' association or if a contracting union or group of employees is dissolved. The Government claims that these provisions in the Labour Law embody and even go beyond the corresponding provisions contained in the said Convention.
.At its Seventh Session (November ) the Committee examined the observations presented by the Government of Venezuela and considered that they did not contain any elements which should cause it to modify the conclusions formulated in its Sixth Report (paragraphs  and ). Whereas the partial observations presented by the Government of Venezuela consisted in the main of a comparative analysis of the provisions of international Conventions relating to freedom of association and the Venezuelan legal system, the conclusions of the Committee in its Sixth Report related exclusively to a situation of fact in respect of which no new elements of information had been presented by the Government of Venezuela.
.Having regard to these considerations, the Committee, while thanking the Government of Venezuela for its observations, considers that they do not call for any modification of the conclusions formulated in paragraph  of its Sixth Report.FURTHER COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS, THE INTER-AMERICAN REGIONAL ORGANISATION OF WORKERS, THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS, THE PERUVIAN PETROLEUM WORKERS' FEDERATION, THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHOREMEN'S AND WAREHOUSEMEN'S UNION (SAN FRANCISCO), THE TRADE UNION INTERNATIONAL OF WORKERS IN THE CHEMICALS PETROLEUM AND ALLIED INDUSTRIES AND THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF CHRISTIAN TRADE UNIONS
.Subsequent to the adoption of its Sixth Report the Committee received a number of complaints of violations of trade union rights in Venezuela with respect to which it has not had the opportunity of reporting to the Governing Body. The first, dated  December , was presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O. The second, dated  April , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers. The third, dated  March , was presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and transmitted by him to the I.L.O. The fourth, dated  October , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation. The fifth, dated  November , was presented to the Secretary-General of the United Nations by the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (San Francisco) and referred by him to the I.L.O. The sixth, dated  January , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries. Finally, the seventh, dated  June , was presented directly to the I.L.O by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions. These complaints are analysed separately in the following pages.Complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (Communication dated  December )Analysis of the Complaint
.In its complaint, the I.C.F.T.U, after referring to the Venezuelan general elections in , stated that the people of Venezuela "" has courageously affirmed its existence in spite of the suppression of the rights of the workers and of freedom of association."". The complainant demanded a thorough investigation into the violations of trade union rights in Venezuela.
.As the complaint of the I.C.F.T.U contained allegations of a general character similar to those already examined in its Sixth Report, the Committee, at its meeting on  June , decided to communicate the complaint to the Venezuelan Government for information, in the light of the recommendations approved by the Governing Body.Analysis of the Reply (Communication dated  October )
.In this communication the Government confirmed the observations which it had made with respect to the Sixth Report of the Committee, and declared, with respect to this complaint and to the complaint presented on  April  by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers, that in no case had the activities of legally constituted trade union organisations been restricted ; the Government firmly defended the rights of trade union organisations provided that they acted within the limits of their legally specified duties.Complaints of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (Communication dated  April ), the World Federation of Trade Unions (Communication dated  March ) and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (Communication dated  November )Analysis of the Complaints
.On the basis of a letter of protest from Mr. Augusto Malav Villalba, General Secretary of the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers, which is affiliated to the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (I.R.O.W), the complaint presented by the latter organisation alleged that, in spite of the efforts made by the I.L.O, following repeated complaints, to persuade the Venezuelan Government to fully recognise trade union rights, the Government was still pursuing a policy of repression of trade unions. Hundreds of trade union leaders were still in prison, including, in particular, Mr. Prez Salinas, the President of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation. Mr. Ramn Quijada, the General Secretary of the Confederation, responsible for agricultural questions and deputy of Mr. Prez Salinas, had also been arrested.
.The complaint presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
357,"(W.F.T.U.) alleged that Mr. Federico Rondn, a member of the Central Committee of the Confederation of Latin American Workers, was arrested on  December  on his return from the Third World Trade Union Congress (W.F.T.U.) and subjected to brutal torture. His wife was also arbitrarily imprisoned. The complaint emphasised that no charge had been brought against Mr. Federico Rondn and that he left the country in October  with a regular passport issued by the Government of Venezuela. The complaint also protested against the arrest, on  February , of Mr. Rodolfo Quintero, President of the Federation of Workers for the Federal District and the State of Miranda, although no valid charge had been or could be brought against him.
.The complaint of the W.F.T.U presented a series of allegations concerning measures taken by the authorities against the Union of Petroleum Workers in the Ribas and Zaraza districts. According to the complainant, a collective agreement similar to the one concluded between the main petrol companies and the "" Independent Trade Union Movement "", an organisation controlled by the Government, was signed on  September  by the Atlantic Refining Company and the executive committee of the above-mentioned union in the presence of the regional delegates of the Ministry of Labour. The signature was ratified in the presence of the civil authorities at Caracas in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. At that meeting, in accordance with the decisions reached by the Union Assembly held on  September , the members of the executive committee lodged a written protest against the conditions under which the agreement had been forced upon them. This protest was made public on  October. On the same day, they were imprisoned and the union offices were searched by the police. Six days later some of them were set free and the civil authorities gave them documents stating that they had been held in preventive detention and were not guilty of any crime. The other members of the executive committee (Claudio Chacn, Fernando Bolivar, Ramn Lozada and Carlos Laza) were detained for  days, then dismissed from their employment with the consent of the labour inspectorate. Later they were taken to the Gurico State prison. The secretary of the union, Mr. Rafael Castillo, one of the leaders who had been released, was forced to draw up an inventory of the assets of the union and to leave the union under the threat of prosecution. On  October the funds and documents of the union were seized by the police ; on  October, the labour inspectorate gave the local delegate of the Ministry of Labour a document attesting that, at a meeting held on  October, the workers had decided to dissolve the union and hand over all its funds to the independent trade union. In actual fact, declared the complainant, no such meeting ever took place, but the authorities attempted to give some show of legality to the arbitrary dissolution of the union and the transfer of its funds to the Government-controlled trade union by forcing the workers, under threats of imprisonment, to sign the document. The complainant considered that these facts clearly showed that the administrative and police authorities had openly interfered in the functioning of a trade union organisation and had attempted to destroy it. By a letter dated  June  the W.F.T.U was informed that, in accordance with the procedure in force, it might furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month. In a letter dated  July  the W.F.T.U stated that, in its view, the facts cited in its original complaint convincingly established the infringements of the exercise of trade union rights committed in Venezuela.
.The complaint presented by the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (San Francisco) protested against the arrest, in order to impede their trade union activities, of several Venezuelan trade union leaders and, in particular, Messrs. Jess Faria, Federico Rondn, Luis Emiro Arrieta and Alicedes Hurtado. On being informed that, according to the procedure in force, it was entitled to present further information within one month, the complaining organisation stated, in a letter dated  January , that in its view it was not necessary to furnish proof in support of the facts alleged in the complaint because the Government had not refuted the allegations made against it and because the persons mentioned in the original complaint were still in prison.Analysis of the Government's Replies (Communications dated  October ,  February  and  October )Communication dated  October 
.In this communication, relating also to the I.C.F.T.U complaint of  December  analysed above, the Venezuelan Government presented its observations on the complaint submitted by the I.R.O.W.
.In no case had workers been the victims of repressive acts on grounds of trade union membership or activities. Workers belonging to trade union organisations sanctioned in the past in accordance with the Labour Law were not subject to disability and many, and in some cases all, of the workers who had belonged to unions dissolved on legal grounds had joined existing trade unions or created new ones. The measures taken by the Government, including measures taken to maintain public order, were based on Constitutional provisions and the Government denied that international organisations were competent to discuss them because such discussion would mean an infringement of the national sovereignty of Venezuela.First request for further information. . At its Seventh Session (November ), the Committee, while noting with satisfaction the assurances given by the Government in its communication of  October  that it had not interfered with the activities of trade union organisations and that the organised workers had not been subjected to repressive measures because of their trade union affiliation, observed that the Government gave no information with reference to the allegation that certain trade union leaders had been arrested. The Committee consequently decided, before examining the case as a whole, to request the Director-General to ask the Venezuelan Government for more detailed information on the imprisonment of the trade union leaders mentioned in the communication of  April  from the I.R.O.W. This request was conveyed to the Venezuelan Government by the Director-General in a letter dated  December .Communication dated  February 
.In this communication the Venezuelan Government referred to its first reply and reaffirmed that not only did it not place any restriction on the activity of legally constituted trade union organisations, but that on the contrary one of the principles of its social policy was to protect the rights of trade unions in so far as they confined their activity to the functions assigned to them by law.
.In connection with the arrest of Mr. Prez Salinas and Mr. Ramn Quijada, the Government contended that those persons were no longer trade union leaders. The Venezuelan Workers' Confederation and its affiliated organisations were dissolved by Executive Decree No. , dated  February , which was subsequently ratified by the National Constituent Assembly of the United States of Venezuela when it approved the reports of the Ministry of Labour. Consequently, a complaint relating to a violation of trade union rights could not be based, according to the Government, on the detention of persons who were no longer trade union leaders. Similarly, Mr. Augusto Malav Villalba could no longer lay claim to the title of General Secretary of a Confederation which ceased to exist nearly four years before.
.The Government stated, more specifically, that Mr. Prez Saunas and Mr. Ramn Quijada were arrested for illegal activities punishable by law, which not only had no connection with trade union activities but were, on the contrary, quite incompatible with such activities. The Government considered that these acts were all the more serious as attempts were made to conceal them under cover of trade union activities and thus to obtain for them the protection given by law to these activities.
.The Government concluded by emphasising that, under the powers granted to it by the Constitution, it alone was entitled to decide the course of action to be followed in relation to the persons in question and reaffirmed that the measures taken to maintain public order were not matters which could be discussed by international organisations because "" to accept such a course would mean an infringement of the principles of national sovereignty "".Second request for further information. . At its Eighth Session (March ) and at its Ninth Session (May ), the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the above complaints in the hope of receiving certain further information from the Government of Venezuela on the I.R.O.W complaint and observations on the complaint of the W.F.T.U, dated  March , communicated to the Government by a letter dated  July .Communication dated  October 
.In this communication the Venezuelan Government presented further observations concerning the complaint of the W.F.T.U and the further information requested by the Committee with reference to the complaint of the I.R.O.W.
.With reference to the allegations of the W.F.T.U relating to the arrest",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
358,"of Mr. Federico Rondn and Mr. Rodolfo Quintero, the Government declared that, although these two persons were known to be Communist leaders and although the Communist Party was dissolved by Decree No.  of  May , they continued, while occupying their positions as trade unionists, to enjoy the rights which labour legislation and the authorities accorded to all workers in Venezuela. The facts which occasioned the measures taken with respect to these two persons had no relation whatever with their status as trade unionists, and the Government repeated its earlier statement to the effect that the measures which it took to protect social tranquillity and the security of the State in the exercise of its Constitutional powers could not be the subject of discussion by any international organ.
.With regard to the allegation of the W.F.T.U relating to the dissolution of the trade union of petroleum workers of the district of Ribas and Zaraza and the detention of the members of its executive committee, the Government declared that the situation of this trade union was carefully examined by the competent officials of the Ministry of Labour and its registration was cancelled because it did not fulfil the requirements laid down in article  of the Labour Law, which provides that trade unions shall not continue to exist if they do not have the number of members required under article  of the same Law. Everything done with respect to the cancellation of the registration of the trade union concerned, including the disposal to be made of its funds and property, was carried out in accordance with the provisions of labour legislation and is shown in the relevant records, in accordance with the communication dated  October  addressed to the Labour Inspector of the State of Gurico by the members of the Winding-Up Committee, Messrs. Gabriel Ramirez, Finance Secretary of the trade union concerned, Rafael Castillo, Secretary, and Luis Pedro Alvarez. The assembly which decided on the winding-up of the trade union and the appointment of the above-mentioned Winding-Up Committee was held at Tucupido, capital of the district of Ribas, on  October , according to the record drawn up on that occasion. On  October , the Winding-Up Committee agreed to transfer the remaining property to the trade union of employees and workers of the petroleum industry and related industries of the State of Gurico, in pursuance of the decision of the above-mentioned assembly, since the majority of the workers belonging to the trade union that was being wound up had joined this union. Only obligations contracted by the trade union were deducted from the funds remaining, including the advance granted by the Executive Committee with respect to the travel expenses to Vienna in October  of Mr. Luis A. Snchez, General Secretary of the trade union, who attended the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Government observed that the trade union of petroleum workers of the districts of Ribas and Zaraza of the State of Gurico could not legally continue in existence since it had decided upon its liquidation. This was the decision of the plenary assembly which was held normally on the date mentioned above. Moreover, the workers who composed the trade union that was being wound up became members of other trade union organisations. The Government added that the documents to which reference was made were at the disposal of the Committee.
.With regard to the request for further information with reference to the complaint presented by the I.R.O.W, the Government declared that it had already furnished its observations and had no further information to offer.Complaints of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation (Communication dated  November ) and the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries (Communication dated  January )Analysis of the Complaints
.The complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation, based also on a communication from the Venezuelan Confederation of Labour in exile, contained a request to the I.L.O, prior to any inquiry which might appear appropriate, to make representations to the Government of Venezuela to secure the re-establishment of freedom of association, so that the Fifth Session of the Petroleum Committee, due to be held in Caracas in the summer of , might take place in an atmosphere of freedom.
.The complaint of the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries, also presented very shortly before the pending meeting in Caracas of the Petroleum Committee, contained allegations of a general nature relating to violations of freedom of association in Venezuela and asked for measures to be taken to secure the liberation of imprisoned trade unionists, the closing of concentration camps, respect for freedom of association and the ending of violent police action and of governmental interference with the functioning of trade unions.
.The complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation was communicated to the Government of Venezuela on  December . The complaining organisation was informed on  November  of its right to present further information, but did not avail itself of this right. With regard to the complaint of  January  from the Trade Union International of Workers in the Chemical, Petroleum and Allied Industries, the Committee decided, at its th Session (May ), not to transmit this complaint to the Government of Venezuela because it did not contain any specific new allegations not already contained in complaints transmitted previously.
.The Government of Venezuela has not presented any observations on the complaint of the Peruvian Petroleum Workers' Federation.Complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (Communications dated  June  and  September )Analysis of the Complaint
.In its communication dated  June  the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions stated that its executive committee had decided to regard the communication dated  April  from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions as a complaint alleging violation of trade union rights presented to the I.L.O in its name. In this communication, the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions alleges a number of events "" which amount to flagrant and intolerable persecution of the free trade union movement completely at variance with the undertaking to preserve liberty given by Venezuela "". The General Secretary of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V (Committee for the Federation of the Organised Workers of Venezuela), Mr. Elio Aponte, is alleged to have been arrested on his return to Venezuela after the First Congress of the Latin American Christian Trade Union Movement, held in Santiago in . On  February  the leaders of the Christian Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P) at Cabimas (Zulia State) were summoned by the local Labour Commissioner. This official demanded to see the account books and invited the members of the union executive to join the trade unions of the Independent Trade Union Movement, affiliated to the government-sponsored National Workers' Confederation. They did not accept this invitation, which would have implied the loss of the independence of the trade union, and the same day the trade union premises were invaded by persons who were not members of the union and who were led by leaders of the Independent Trade Union Movement. The Labour Commissioner, who was also present, stated that the fusion of the two organisations should take place at once. Mr. Csar Vergel Lozano, a representative of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, refused to accept this arbitrary command ; the premises were then occupied by force and all the goods and property of the union, including a considerable quantity of cash, were confiscated.
.The following day, representatives of the Independent Trade Union Movement took similar action against the Union of Organised Oilworkers (U.T.O.P) of Bachaquero (Zulia State), also a Christian trade union. The property of this union was transferred to the local police station. The Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P), in the Simn Rodriguez district of Anzotegui State, another affiliate of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, was also subjected to action of a similar kind, and Mr. Francisco Fernndez, a representative of C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V, and its executive committee were detained. The Oilworkers' Union (S.T.O.P) of the Sotillo district of Anzotegui State is alleged to have been treated in the same way.
.In the name of the Independent Petroleum Workers' Union, an affiliate of the Independent Trade Union Movement, threats were publicly made on  February  against the S.T.O.P Oilworkers' Union branches in Carirubana, Los Taques and Punto Cardn, in the Falcn district of Falcn State. These threats have been carried out, various leaders of these trade unions having been attacked.
.C.O.F.E.T.R.O.V lodged a complaint (without any result) with the Minister of Labour against these attacks, because it is alleged that officials of the Ministry of Labour in the different localities had helped the persons concerned in making the attacks.
.The International Federation of Christian Trade Unions was informed of its right to furnish further information and did so by a communication dated  September . By the same communication it transmitted photo-copies of documents emanating from the Direction of the Cabinet of the Ministry of Labour of Venezuela and from the National Executive Committee of the Independent Trade",-1,1953,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
359,"Union Movement. The first document states that Mr. Temilio A. Chirinos "" carries out special missions in relation to trade union matters on the orders of the Ministry of Labour "". The second document states that the same person is authorised to represent the executive committee of the Independent Trade Union Movement in all the transactions which it may be required to perform before the civil and military authorities of the State. In the complaint in question it is specifically stated that elements of the Independent Trade Union Movement, commissioned for this purpose by the Department, have exercised repression against Christian trade union organisations. In the opinion of the complainant, the documents presented prove that the Ministry of Labour has entrusted "" special missions in trade union affairs "" to persons acting as officers of the Independent Trade Union Movement. This implies, the complainant continues, a clear intervention by the Government in trade union affairs and demonstrates the collaboration existing between the Government and the Independent Trade Union Movement.
.The communications from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions were transmitted to the Government of Venezuela by a communication dated  November . So far, the Government of Venezuela has not transmitted any observations on this complaint.
.In the light of the foregoing facts and circumstances the Committee considers that it has fulfilled its responsibility for making a preliminary examination of the matter and it now transmits the case to the Governing Body for consideration of the action to be taken and of the advisability of possibly referring the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission.Geneva,  June .

360,".At its meeting in January , the Committee had before it two complaints against the Venezuelan Government presented respectively by the American Federation of Labor, in May , and by the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, in June , and observations relating to these complaints forwarded by the Government of Venezuela in a letter dated  February . The Committee then concluded that the case called for further examination by the Governing Body.
.At its meeting in March , the Committee, having been informed of the desire of the Government of Venezuela to submit further observations to it, recommended the Governing Body to postpone examination of the case in order to enable the Venezuelan Government to communicate its further observations to the Committee.
.When the Committee's two reports came before it, the Governing Body, at its th Session (Geneva, - March ) decided to postpone the examination of the case. By a letter dated  March , the Director-General informed the Government of Venezuela of this decision.
.In reply to this letter, the Director-General received two letters dated  May  from the Government of Venezuela transmitting the further observations to which it had referred.
.The Committee, at its meeting on  June , heard a statement by the representatives of the Government of Venezuela who received the observations of their Government and supplemented them with respect to certain points.
.The Director-General has received a further complaint against the Government of Venezuela, dated  April , from the Secretary-General of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (I.C.F.T.U.). Moreover, the complaints transmitted to the I.L.O by the Economic and Social Council at its th Session (New York, May ) also include a number of complaints against the Government of Venezuela.
.The Committee, at its meeting on  June , adjourned therefore its examination of the case in order to enable the Government of Venezuela to present its observations on the new complaints. These observations were transmitted to the Director-General by letter of  November . The Government of Venezuela also communicated to the Committee, by letter of  November , the summary of a speech delivered by the President of the Governing Committee (Junta de Gobierno) of Venezuela on the eve of the parliamentary elections of  November .
.The Committee, at its meeting in December , having taken note of the various communications submitted to it, requested the Government to transmit to it a statement on the trade union situation in general in Venezuela on the morrow of the parliamentary elections of  November .This decision was communicated to the Government by letter of  January . The Government transmitted to the Director-General, by letter of  February , a statement on the present position of Venezuelan trade unions.
.As the complaints presented by the American Federation of Labor and by the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, as well as the Government's first replies, are already contained in the earlier reports of the Committee, it will be sufficient to analyse in this report the new complaints, the observations of the Government, dated  May , and made at the meeting of the Committee on  June , as well as the Government's replies of  and  November  and the letter, dated  February  on the present situation of Venezuelan trade unions.
.The complaint which the I.C.F.T.U addressed to the Director-General by a letter dated  April  tends to confirm and supplement a similar complaint addressed to the United Nations and transmitted to the I.L.O by the Economic and Social Council together with a number of other complaints presented against the Venezuelan Government by various trade union organisations.
.Associating itself with the complaints submitted earlier by the American Federation of Labor and by the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, the I.C.F.T.U recalls, in particular, that several central organisations of workers were dissolved in  and that all the oilworkers' unions suffered the same fate in . The I.C.F.T.U and also the other complainants allege, further, that many trade union leaders have been detained for several months, and some of them even for several years. In certain cases, it is claimed, the prisoners have been ill-treated by the police.
.In conclusion, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to express the hope that the discussions on the measures necessary to secure a fuller application of the principles of freedom of association which have been taking place between the Venezuelan Government and the national and international trade union organisations concerned, will be continued, and, in this connection, to decide to draw the attention of the Government of Venezuela to the desirability of:(i) taking appropriate measures to ensure to employers and workers full freedom to form, within the limits of the law, organisations of their own choosing and to join such organisations ;(ii) re-examining the cases of trade union leaders who are stated still to be in custody under the provisions of emergency legislation, in order to ensure that no person shall, without having had the benefit of the guarantees afforded by normal judicial procedure, be deprived of his freedom because of his membership of a trade union or of his lawful trade union activities ;(iii) re-examining the legal provisions at present in force with respect to employers' and workers' organisations in order to bring them into harmony with the principles laid down in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, , and, in particular, the provisions relating to the cancellation of the registration of trade unions and to the dissolution of trade unions by administrative authority.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the general situation of the trade union movement in Venezuela, the Governing Body has at its disposal the report of the I.L.O. Mission to Venezuela and the observations of the Government of Venezuela on the same report. The data necessary for appreciating the position are therefore available.
.The dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, to which the second part of the complaint relates, took place after the events dealt with in the above documents and have therefore not been the subject of any similar examination. The versions given by the Government and by the complainants differ considerably with regard to the circumstances under which the events took place which gave rise to the dissolution of the petroleum workers' unions, but they are in agreement as to the dissolution having actually taken place. It is quite clear from the text of the dissolution Decree attached to the complaint that the measure was taken by the administrative authorities without the case first having been submitted to the competent courts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends that the case merits further examination by the Governing Body.",0,1950,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
