This is precisely what happened in the signing of the so-called  Framework Agreement'  CODELCO, in the hope of contributing to the resolution of the dispute affecting its contracting enterprises and their workers, signed the document, which clearly sets out guidelines of a general nature for these enterprises. CODELCO, despite having an interest in the issue, is subject to obvious limitations as regards interfering in the definitions used in the human resources policies of contracting enterprises.\n.With respect to the situation described in the complaint regarding the alleged resurgence of blacklisting at CODELCO, which prevents access to workplaces by some union leaders and also prohibits work from being given to others, the Government shares the view of the Committee on Freedom of Association that  all practices involving the blacklisting of trade union officials constitute a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union rights, and, in general, governments should take stringent measures to combat such practices'  That notwithstanding, there is no evidence to prove that such practices have been introduced by CODELCO. Furthermore, the accusations in question do not correspond with reality, as CODELCO is noted nationally for having almost universal unionization rates among its workers and supervisors.\n.With regard to the alleged refusal by CODELCO to grant persons access to workplaces, it should be stated that, according to a report on the issue by the enterprise,  workers with a contract in force with subcontracting enterprises who are working in industrial areas in the enterprise s various divisions can enter without restriction in order to fulfil their agreed duties, under the responsibility and oversight of their respective employers'  However, although no employment relationship exists, CODELCO,  in order to safeguard the health and integrity of persons and the security of its facilities, authorizes access to workplaces provided that the corresponding permits are requested from the administration at the appropriate time and with proper grounds' \n.As will be appreciated, the complainant workers, as workers for subcontracting enterprises, would not have free access to the corporation s facilities but conditional access to the workplace entrusted to their employer. These measures to restrict access are implemented for the safety and physical integrity of people in mining installations, and in order to comply with regulations on mining safety (Supreme Decree No.  of ) and Supreme Decree No.  of , which approved basic sanitary and environmental conditions for workplaces that apply to the whole of the country s mining industry and whose aim, naturally, is to prevent risks in mining installations.\n.With regard to requests for removal of union leaders, the procedure has been defined as such by the contracting enterprises for which the individuals concerned work. This procedure is, in essence, a mechanism to protect the worker against possible acts of discrimination by the employer and, as such, is a means of guaranteeing protection of the right to organize. This guarantee arises from section  of the Labour Code, which states that  in the case of workers subject to immunity from dismissal, the employer may not terminate a contract without prior authorization from a competent judge, who may allow it in the case of the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  of section  and those in section ' \n.It is for this reason, and with a view to safeguarding the employment stability of this group of workers, for example by preventing the use of anti-union practices through the discriminatory dismissal of workers, that a prior decision must be made by the courts of law, whose independence and impartiality are beyond doubt. Taking such action does not constitute an anti-union act; quite the contrary, it demonstrates a decision to proceed in obtaining prior validating authorization from a competent judge before dismissing a union leader, and the decision will therefore be taken after  due process' in which the parties, on an equal footing, can present their arguments, with the final decision resting in the hands of the judicial authorities. Of course, the legitimate party to initiate removal proceedings is the employer, in this case the contracting enterprises.\n.Consequently, CODELCO cannot be considered to have engaged in anti-union practices in this sense given that, on the one hand, the removal process had been validated with regard to its legal efficiency and effectiveness by the ILO and, on the other hand, this process must be directed by the direct employer in respect of its own workers with immunity, which means that CODELCO, as the main enterprise, is also not responsible for removal actions against workers belonging to the CTC.\n.With regard to CODELCO s invocation of the resources of protection and amparo (protection of constitutional rights) against the CTC, it should be clarified that the intervention of the judicial authorities in this specific case was considered indispensable by the enterprise in order to ensure guarantees of fair legal proceedings, bearing in mind that the proceedings, in accordance with the principle of interdependence of powers, are required to guarantee respect for, and compliance with, domestic law and international treaties incorporated into legislation, which includes Conventions Nos  and . This simply reflects the provisions of the Chilean Fundamental Charter, article  of which establishes that  the authority to hear civil, criminal and labour cases and to enforce judgements in such cases is vested exclusively in the courts established by law. Neither the President of the Republic nor Congress may exercise judicial functions, express an opinion on matters that are still pending, review the grounds or content of court rulings or reopen lawsuits that have been settled' \n.Regarding the facts and the case for amparo and protection brought against the CTC, CODELCO states that  as the main enterprise, it was obliged to ensure the safety and physical and psychological integrity of all those working in its installations, whatever their principal employer, and, in consequence of this duty of care, it was obliged to take the appropriate actions as allowed by law and use various means of protection in order to put an end to the illegal and violent strike pursued by the CTC'  The demonstrations in question, which prompted recourse to the courts and whose nature and effects have already been described in the observations previously made by the Government, caused a disturbance and threatened the legitimate exercise of the rights of workers at CODELCO and other enterprises not involved in the dispute. Of course, the operations put at risk by the actions of the CTC are highly complex and require safeguards for security procedures.\n.With regard to the rulings handed down by the higher courts of justice in relation to the simulation of a subcontracting arrangement and the alleged introduction of an entire procedure designed to avoid applying the Subcontracting Act, it should be stated that these rulings were given in the context of the protection proceedings brought by CODELCO against the Labour Directorate which, using its supervisory powers, officially warned the enterprise to directly contract a significant number of workers from contracting enterprises. Section . of the Subcontracting Act, No. , states, with the aim of avoiding possible acts of simulation by employing enterprises, that  if the services provided are undertaken without being subjected to the requirements set out in the previous paragraph or are solely limited to the subcontracting of workers at a workplace, the employer shall be understood to be the entity in charge of the workers, enterprise or workplace, without prejudice to the appropriate sanctions arising from application of section '  This provision, aimed at protecting workers, allocates the burden of proof in the worker s favour, establishing a legal premise that the employer against which a complaint has been made must provide evidence to the contrary.\n.In this regard, the Labour Directorate ruled that CODELCO should directly contract a specific number of workers from contracting enterprises. CODELCO, questioning the alleged facts as determined by the supervisory body, decided to begin legal proceedings to restrict the actions of the Labour Director. The case brought by CODELCO eventually came before Chile s Supreme Court, as part of proceedings in which the CTC participated.\n.With regard to the court s jurisprudence, it should be clarified that Chilean legislation does not accord binding force to rulings given in other cases, so the situation referred to by the complainant in its written complaint,"", "".The complainants allege that some of the legislative provisions in force are contrary to the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. Thus, Act No.  dated  December  prescribes that in collective agreements concluded after this date, the employer may offer the same conditions of work existing on  December  without any subsequent readjustability. In this way Act No.  allows employers to prevent not only the readjustment of workers' wages when negotiations are initiated but also all future readjustments. This regulation is issued at a time when inflation for the coming year is expected to reach  per cent and is compounded by the fact that the minimum duration of a collective agreement is two years. In the same way, the salaries of public employees have been frozen since August  in pursuance of Decree No.  of that year.\n.Likewise, Act No.  dated  December  prohibits trade unions from receiving financial aid from the undertakings to which their members belong as well as from foreign natural or legal persons; in the event of infringement provision is made for the application of penal sanctions and the reimbursement of the amounts unlawfully received. Furthermore, in the Diario Oficial (Official Gazette) of  August , the Government published a list of  undertakings whose workers may negotiate but not go on strike, essentially because such undertakings are strategic establishments for national defence and security. These include the following undertakings; CODELCO (copper mining), Ferrocarriles del Estado (railways), Compaa de Telfonos (telephones), ENTEL, SNAP (petroleum), LAN (air transport), CASCO (gas), Empresa Nacional de Explosivos (explosives), ENDESA (electricity), CHILECTRA and Banco del Estado (State bank).\n.The Government states that the Constitutional Court has ruled that Act No.  of , which amends Legislative Decree No.  respecting contracts of work and Legislative Decree No.  respecting collective bargaining conforms to the law. This act was issued on the basis of considerations regarding the economic recession affecting all countries. In the present crisis, the country has not; been able to escape this recession and thus a system of automatic wage indexing would seriously compromise employment. The act had to take realistic account of this situation so as to avoid creating greater, unemployment.\n.The Government states that the allegation concerning the;, suspension of readjustment of wages in the public sector is incorrect since remunerations were increased by  per cent in ; moreover, they will be further increased from  January  by  per cent. In addition to the above-mentioned increases, three bonuses equivalent to  per cent of salary have been granted to public employees; two of these bonuses have already been paid and the third was due in November .\n.As regards workers who do not enjoy the right to strike, the Government states that, as in all other countries, undertakings exist in Chile in which workers may not strike because of the prejudice which this would cause to the community arising out of the nature of their activity. However, in Chile this consideration has been reconciled with the need to maintain justice in the field of labour and thus workers who may not go on strike settle disputes at the collective bargaining stage through arbitration which the employer may not refuse and to whose results he is bound.\n.As regards the prohibition concerning contributions to trade union organisations from employers or foreign bodies, the Government points out that the trade union act comprises an adequate system of financing by means of ordinary and extraordinary contributions from its members which are automatically deducted from their remunerations. Trade union financing by undertakings and foreign bodies is prohibited. This is a basic premise of the regime of freely chosen membership which becomes effective only to the extent that the trade unions achieve their own goals by the diligent action of their leaders rather than on the basis of extraneous advantages such as those which would be possible through outside financing.Furthermore, in this way acts of interference on the part of the employer, who could discriminate in favour of the trade union of his choice or one which is amenable to his influence, may be avoided.\n.The Committee notes that Act No.  of  December  places important restrictions on collective bargaining, in particular as regards the indexing of remunerations. In this respect, noting that both the Government and the complainants have drawn attention to the existence of serious difficulties in the economic field, the Committee would like to point out that if, for compelling reasons of national economic interest, a government considers that wage rates cannot be fixed by collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards [See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Canada-Quebec), paragraph .]. To this end, the Committee would like to stress that Act No.  does not establish a specific period of application and that none of its provisions makes it possible to suppose that it is a temporary act rather than one of an indeterminate duration. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not indicated whether measures have been taken to protect workers'. living standards. Therefore the Committee draws the attention of the, Government to the fact that the period of application of the, restrictions on collective bargaining as regards the indexing of wages established in Act No.  should not exceed a reasonable period of' time and that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.\n.Furthermore the Committee notes that the Government states that the allegation concerning the suspension of wage indexing for workers in the public sector is incorrect since remunerations were increased by  per cent in  and will be further increased by  per cent in January  and that furthermore three bonuses equivalent to  per cent of salary have been awarded to public employees.\n.As regards the strike prohibition in  undertakings, the Committee notes that according to the Government this is due to the prejudice which the holding of strikes in such undertakings would cause to the community. The Committee also observes that in the undertakings concerned collective bargaining disputes may be resolved through arbitration. The Committee has pointed out on a number of, occasions [See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), paragraph .] that, as one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational. interests, the right to strike may be denied or seriously; restricted only in public services or services essential in the strict sense of the term (those whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). The Committee considers in this respect that some of the undertakings mentioned by the complainant in which strikes are prohibited do not appear to provide essential services in the sense expressed above. The Committee therefore draws the attention of the Government to the need to limit the list of undertakings in which strikes are prohibited (cf. Diario Oficial (Official Gazette) dated S August ) to those which provide essential services in the strict sense of the term.\n.As regards the prohibition for trade unions to receive financial assistance from the undertakings to which their members belong, or from foreign natural or legal persons (Act No. ), the Committee considers that although the first prohibition is understandable from the point of view of the principle of the non-interference of employers and their organisations in workers' organisations, the second prohibition may place an important restriction on the right of trade union organisations to affiliate to higher level international organisations (federations and confederations) and to receive financial assistance from these organisations. The Committee asks the Government to take measures with a view to amending this provision.Allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders\n.The complainants allege that on  September , following a demonstration held in the city of Concepcin to demand the return of Chilean exiles, Maria Eugenia Darricarrere Andreo, leader of the Trade Union Association of Workers of Chile (AGECH) and Rend Carvajal Ziga, labour adviser of the coal workers' trade unions, were detained and falsely accused of having placed a fire bomb in the vicinity of the City Hall of Concepcin. Some days later Jos Ortz Aravena, President of the AGECH, was detained for  hours and tortured. According to the latter, Mrs. Darricarrere was subjected to physical ill-treatment.\n.The complainants also allege that in November or December  the following trade union leaders were arrested. Ernesto Vega Alvarez, Domingo Tapia and Juan Sez, and in January , Lorenzo Boroa, Maria Luisa Traipe and Manuel Espinoza, who were also trade union leaders.\n.The Government states that on  October  Mrs. Maria Eugenia Darricarrere Andreo and Mr. Rend Carvajal Ziga were arrested on the orders of the Second Military Court of Concepcin, for having violated the act respecting the control"", "".The complainants allege that some of the legislative provisions in force are contrary to the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining.

The National Grouping of Workers (CNT) satisfied these requirements but did not even receive an acknowledgement in reply. In view of this situation, the CNT leadership called on the workers and the population of Santiago to meet on the Plaza de los Hroes on  May at  a.m.\n.The report also indicates that on  April the authorities had prevented the holding of an artistic and cultural event at union premises of the Confederation of Leather and Footwear Workers to celebrate May Day.\n.On  May the city of Santiago was practically occupied by the police and the military. In spite of this climate, thousands of people approached the meeting place and, when the first groups formed, the police forces hurled projectiles and tear gas at them. Dozens of persons were wounded. All persons and all vehicles were checked and approximately  persons arrested, including Manuel Bustos, Vice-President of the CNT, Jorge Mills, a member of the national council of the CNT, and Humberto Arcos, an official of the Confederation of Unions of Workers in the Metal Industry. The majority of these persons were released on the same day with a summons to appear before the Police Court for having caused a disturbance of the peace.\n.Also on the morning of  May, two trade union premises belonging to the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers (CONTEVECH) and to the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) were illegally searched. Furniture and documents were destroyed or removed. The persons present were threatened, certain of them were struck, and  teachers attending a meeting at the premises of the AGECH were arrested, although organisations with a legal personality (as in the case of the AGECH) are not required to request authorisation to hold meetings at their own premises to deal with matters within their competence.\n.In its communication of  June , the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC) alleges that on  April  the Director-General for Industrial Relations of the National Copper Corporation (CODELCO) notified  workers of the termination of their work contract on the basis of article (f) of Legislative Decree No. . This provision permits an employer to dismiss workers without specifying the grounds for dismissal, with  days\' notice or by paying compensation of an amount equal to the last monthly wage. According to the CTC, this permits the Government and employers, as in this case, to take discriminatory measures against trade unions.\n.The CTC states that all those affected by this measure were skilled workers, had behaved irreproachably and had from  to  years\' service in the undertaking. The only possible grounds for their dismissal are therefore their active participation in trade union meetings and activities. Furthermore, four of them were about to become trade union officials. Moreover, this measure was intended to intimidate the workers in the undertaking in order to impede their trade union action. These assumptions are substantiated by the fact that on the day of the dismissals, the two unions of El Salvador with the largest number of affiliates had convened assemblies for the purpose of putting their affairs in order following the disqualification of their leaders decreed by the Ministry of Labour. These assemblies unanimously rejected the dismissals and condemned the measure taken by CODELCO. For ten days,  of the dismissed workers went on hunger strike.\n.In its communication of  June , the National Union of Workers of the Telephone Company of Chile states that on  April  it presented a draft collective agreement to the Telephone Company in conformity with the legislation in force. The employer replied on  April , raising objections to the draft in respect of the situation of replacement telephone operators, although the latter are not among those workers barred from collective bargaining under article  of Legislative Decree No. . On  May , after compulsory arbitration proceedings had been initiated, the Director of Labour issued a resolution in which it was decided to exclude from collective bargaining the situation of the  members of the union employed as replacement operators. The union points out that the persons concerned are covered by an indefinite work contract and have more than  years\' continuous service in the undertaking. The union adds that the Santiago Provincial Labour Inspector had issued on  May  a totally contrary resolution which recognised the right of these workers to participate in collective bargaining. Lastly, the union indicates that it submitted appeals to the courts but that the latter had not yet handed down their judgement.\n.In its communication of  September , the ICFTU alleges that Juan Fernando Reyes, President of the ""El Roto Chileno"" Peasants\' Federation of Curico and his family had been subjected to constant threats since  July . On several occasions, armed and masked civilians conducted night searches at his home and destroyed furniture and other objects. The appeal for protection submitted by his lawyers was rejected, as, according to police sources, no warrant for arrest or order of inquiry had been issued in his case. Since then, his home was again searched and his wife severely beaten.\n.In its communication of  September , the FISE refers to the arrest by the security services of Mr. Guillermo Scherping, Under-Secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile. The FISE fears that his life is in danger.\n.Works Union No.  of the National Copper Corporation of Chile states in its communication of  September  that on  September police officers arrived at the Union\'s offices for the purpose of evicting the six workers referred to in a previous complaint presented by the Confederation of Copper Workers, as well as their families who had organised a soup kitchen on the premises since their dismissal by the National Copper Corporation, at a time when they enjoyed trade union ""immunity"". The police officer responsible for this eviction presented no document issued by a competent authority.\n.The National Confederation of Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities, for its part, refers to the warrant issued for the arrest of its president, Sergio Troncoso Cisternas. The complainant organisation points out that Mr. Troncoso, who had already been detained on several occasions, was sought by persons in civilian clothes on  September , when he was in the German Democratic Republic to attend the Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.\n.CONSTRAMET indicates that its leaders Jos Ramn Avello Soto and Ronaldo Muez Moreno were sought by the police as of the day following the proclamation of the state of emergency,  September . Furthermore, a regional secretary of the organisation, Humberto Arcos Vera, is under permanent surveillance, as are the Confederation\'s offices. The complainant organisation also indicates that the police authorities prohibited meetings of several constituent unions (the Eugenio Gonzlez, Morgan and Fuenzalida Unions) which were in the process of negotiation.\n.FENTATREX refers to the dismissal of three trade union officials by the Via dye works. It explains that these officials were declared responsible for the fact that  of the  workers in the undertaking did not arrive for work on the protest day held on  September , as they were without means of transport, sick or unable to leave their district which was occupied by law enforcement agents. The undertaking then arbitrarily applied sections . and . of Legislative Decree No.  which penalises unlawful acts preventing the worker from being present at his work or discharging his obligations as a worker and the direction of or active participation in any unlawful interruption or stoppage of work. The dismissals were decided without notice being given, without the right to compensation and in contravention of ""trade union immunity"".\n.FENTATREX indicates that  workers at the San Martino textiles undertaking had to take the risk of meeting in private houses to discuss a draft collective agreement since a consequence of the proclamation of the state of emergency was to prohibit meetings of trade unions which do not possess their own premises.\n.The Miners\' Confederation alleges that several trade unionists were dismissed for having participated in collective bargaining: in particular, the former official of the Lota Union No.  of the National Coal Enterprise (ENACAR), Fresia Mellado Opazo, and ten workers of Union No,  of Victoria de Lbu. It is alleged further that an official of ENACAR Union No. , Juan Carlos Salazar Sierra, was disqualified from holding his union post and that workers at the Minero Cerro Negro undertaking, including the trade union official Rolando Chacana Ganza, were arrested for purported thefts of explosives. Lastly, it is alleged that, at the Agustinas de Copiapo mine, the Agustinas mining enterprise unilaterally decided to lower salaries in  and  at a time when the collective agreement was in force.\n.Finally, in a joint letter several Chilean national confederations indicate that the homes of officials of', 'Renato Hevia, director of the review Mensaje and member of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile.\n.In its communication of  January , the WFTU estimates that , persons were arrested and  killed in . In addition,  trade union activists are said to have been banished to other parts of the country by government decision. Since in its view the Government is continuing to ignore the recommendations of the Committee and the Governing Body, the WFTU requests that a commission be sent to Chile.\n.In its communication of  January , the WFTU alleges that on  and  November  during a protest demonstration organised in solidarity with the arrested trade unionists, four persons were killed. According to witnesses, three of them were killed by military personnel and one by civilians who fired shots from a van. In addition, on these days,  persons were banished to the north of Chile.\n.The WFTU also mentions the case of three teachers of the No.  School ""Puerto Navarino"", who were dismissed for having protested against being paid with worthless cheques.\n.The WFTU refers to the arrest on  December  at Rancagua of Rodermil Aranda Flores, leader of the Trade Union of the Caletones Mines. His house was searched and a poster, a cassette and a publication were seized. He was, however, accused of stocking abundant material for subversive activities, such as explosives and paramilitary type equipment.\n.In addition, the WFTU alleges the dismissal of the President of the Metropolitan Medical College, Dr. Ricardo Vacarezza, as a reprisal for his stance against the Government\'s health policy. A solidarity meeting organised by doctors was allegedly prohibited.\n.In its communication of  February , the ICFTU alleges that, on  January  following a request from the Ministry of Labour, a Santiago court annulled the elections which had been held during the last congress of the Copper Workers\' Confederation in January . In addition, the elected officers (including Rodolfo Seguel, re-elected President by a majority vote) can neither express opinions nor represent their union on pain of imprisonment. On  January, Labour Ministry officials, supported by the police, confiscated the Confederation\'s assets and froze its bank accounts, thus preventing the Confederation\'s  employees from being paid.\n.It appears from the various replies of the Government that, after the violent events of ,  and  September , the Ministry of the Interior lodged a complaint with the ordinary courts to determine who was responsible for instigating, fomenting or taking part in the protest. The Government states that ten persons lost their lives during those days, that about  were injured, and that  policemen were seriously injured. The acts of violence and the ransacking of various commercial establishments caused  million pesos\' worth of damages, and many public places were also damaged.\n.The Court of Santiago appointed Mr. Sergio Valenzuela Patio as magistrate to examine the complaints of contravention of sections (c),  i)and () of the State Security Act No. , adopted in . These sections refer to meetings with a view to overthrowing the Government or conspiring to destabilise it; the holding of unauthorised demonstrations on the public thoroughfare; and the unlawful interruption or collective suspension of, or strikes in, public services, services essential to the public, production activities, transport or commerce which provoke disturbances of the peace, disruptions in services essential to the public or damage to vital industries.\n.The examining magistrate ordered the arrest of, and brought charges against,  persons whom he considered to bear the responsibility for the offences under the State Security Act. This decision was confirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court following appeals presented by the defendants. The magistrate released eight of the accused on bail (Rodolfo Seguel, Luis Campos, Jos Figueroa, Arturo Martnez, Jorge Pavez, Samuel Bello, Carlos Poblete and Jos Rivera). Only four of the accused were denied release on bail by the examining magistrate: Manuel Bustos, Jos Ruiz di Giorgio, Mario Araneda and Eduardo Valencia, against whom proceedings were under way. Following an uprising in the Santiago Penitentiary, the prisoners were transferred to an establishment named Capuchinos, which is more comfortable and where security is stricter. All the releases on bail were confirmed by the Court of Appeal with the exception of those of Rodolfo Seguel and Arturo Martnez.\n.Following further appeals presented by their counsel, Rodolfo Seguel, Eduardo Valencia and Arturo Martnez were released on bail on  November . Subsequently, on  December , the Court of Appeal unanimously decided to dismiss the charges against Jos Ruiz di Giorgio, since his participation in the offences was not proven. He was released the same day. The Court also decided to release Mario Araneda provisionally, but maintained the charges against him. The Court unanimously refused to dismiss the charges against Manuel Bustos and to release him provisionally. His counsel stated that he intended to reapply for his release on bail in January . In this connection, the Government states that, in accordance with Chilean criminal procedure, provisional release may be requested as often as necessary before an individual is finally released.\n.Finally, on  December , the Court of Appeal unanimously decided to release Manuel Bustos on bail, and he left prison on the same day.\n.As the regards the events of ,  and  September  which gave rise to the charges, the Government remarks that there were no strikes in the public service on those days. It reaffirms that the arrested trade unionists were released by decision of the examining magistrate and the Court of Appeal and that the judges and courts are independent. Consequently, the executive cannot give any instruction regarding the manner in which the law is to be applied. As regards the strikes, the Government recalls that Legislative Decree No.  of  to lay down rules for collective bargaining and strikes is fully applied in the country. Thus, between August  and June , there were  strikes, involving , workers and representing , lost workdays. It is thus clear, according to the Government, that workers\' organisations have made use of strike action to defend the economic and social interests of their members. The Government also furnishes detailed statistics on collective agreements concluded between employers and workers.\n.As regards the allegation relating to the arrest of Father Renato Hevia, the Government states that the Ministry of the Interior has requested the appointment of a magistrate to investigate the articles published in the Catholic review Mensaje managed by the person concerned. The First Chamber of the Court of Appeal of Santiago charged Father Hevia with insulting the President of the Republic and ordered him to be placed in preventive custody. The examining magistrate, following his investigations, concluded that there was insufficient evidence and provisionally dismissed the case, releasing the accused on bail. Finally, the Government states that there is no evidence that Father Hevia is a trade union official or member, or that he is a member of the AGECH. In the Government\'s view, this proves yet again that freedom of association bodies are being used for the sole purpose of embarrassing a member State.\n.As regards the arrest of trade union officials in the port sector, the Government points out that these persons were arrested for having caused disturbances on the public thoroughfare on  November , preventing movements of pedestrians and vehicles. A trade union official asked the Minister of Labour to intervene to obtain their release. The Minister obtained their release against a bail of  pesos (about US$) for each of them and paid this sum himself.\n.In connection with this case, the Government recalls that the offices of the ILO were illegally occupied by five persons for five days. It considers that the occupation of offices, the taking of hostages and illegal confinement for the purpose of attracting attention is an inadmissible way of exerting pressure, particularly when there are appropriate channels for dealing with freedom of association matters.\n.As regards the strike of maritime and port workers in the ports of Valparaso and San Antonio, the Government explains that the organisation of work in this sector was altered by Act No.  in September . According to the Government, this Act put an end to practices that were highly unfavourable to the workers, such as the hiring out of work permits, under which the worker had to pay half of the remuneration he received to the owner of the workbook or labour permit. This Act was therefore widely supported by the workers. With a view to improving the new system, tripartite commissions were set up and their studies resulted in a Bill to introduce major improvements in the fields of work and social welfare; this entered into force on  December . Finally, the Government states that no trade union leader in the maritime and port sector is under arrest and that work is proceeding normally in all the ports of the country.\n.In its communication of  February , the Government provides information on the persons alleged to', '.The present case concerns allegations of violation of freedom of association in Chile submitted by the following trade union organisations in various communications: the international Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  and  December ,  January and  March , the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) on  December ,  January and  March , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) on  January , the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), the Trade Unions International of workers in the metal Industry, the Confederation of Copper Workers on  December , and the National Trade Unions Confederation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials industries on  December .\n.The Government supplied certain information in communications dated  February,  April and  May .\n.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.All the complainant organisations denounced the arrest and subsequent expulsion without justification on  December  of the trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, President of the National Trade Union Co-coordinating Council (CNS), and Hector Cuevas, National President of the Confederation of Building workers, both of whom had launched a protest movement against the increase in the cost of living and unemployment.\n.Specifically, the ICFTU in its initial communications described the calendar of events in the following manner: on  July , more than  trade union leaders headed by Manuel Bustos, President of the CNS, and Emilio Torres, President of the Confederation of Copper Workers, wrote to the President of the Republic requesting an audience to discuss the workers\' problems and the application by employers of the new regulations concerning wages and job stability, which had been drawn up without the workers being consulted. Their letter called for a frank dialogue with the authorities and the suspension of Act No.  on collective bargaining. The letter was signed by the Confederation of Copper Workers, the Workers\' United Front, the Confederation of Chilean Private Sector Employees and the CNS and contained  signatures of leaders of various confederations, federations, associations, national and local trade unions.\n.According to the ICFTU, the President of the Republic replied that he did not grant audiences to communists. The trade union leaders Bustos and Torres and the president of the public sector workers, Hernol Flores, were then allegedly detained for some hours by the police authorities, interrogated and threatened by the Director-General of the intelligence service.\n.A subsequent letter which was addressed to the Minister of Finance on  October described the economic situation of the workers and a set of urgent minimum measures which the Government was requested to introduce. The authorities once again refused to listen to the grievances of the legitimate representatives of the workers.\n.On  October the Minister of the Interior refused to allow the Taxi Drivers Union, led by Juan Jara C, to meet to discuss the economic situation as it affected taxi drivers.\n.On  November, by resolution No.  of the departmental labour inspector of Santiago South, Trade Union, No.  of the ""Sumac"" S.A cotton factory was prohibited from holding a union meeting of solidarity with the Polish trade unionist Lech Walesa to which the principal trade union leaders of Chile were to be invited.\n.Or.  November, the CNS requested authorisation from the Ministry of the Interior to organise an artistic and cultural event which was designed to raise funds to help unemployed workers who had been dismissed and their families. The request stated that the event was to take place in the Plaza Artesanos on Thursday,  December, between  p.m. and . p.m. approximately and that it would include, it addition to performances by a number of entertainers, an address by a trade union leader on the subject of unemployment, price increases and the exceptional wage readjustment of  per cent. The request was signed by ten CNS leaders, including Manuel Bustos, but the authorities replied that, in order to be considered, it must be submitted by a trade union organisation with an accredited legal personality. Several duly accredited trade union organisations affiliated to the CNS therefore introduced the same request. This time, however, the authorities did not reply.\n.On  November , uniformed members of the police burst into the headquarters of the National Trade Union of Industrial Assembly Workers (SINAII) in which the CNS offices are located and prevented the trade union leaders from entering the premises for several days.\n.Finally, on  December , the planned trade union meeting took place in the Plaza Artesanos. However, it was repressed with extreme violence. The workers who had gathered peacefully were provoked and attacked by the uniformed police services and by groups of civilians armed with blurt and sharp instruments and who acted under the protection of the uniformed police. Several persons were wounded and arrested. Eight of these were in a serious condition, in particular Efrain Plaza, CNS President for the central zone, who had to undergo an emergency operation, as a result of the blows which he had received from the police. The lawyers who intervened in support of the wounded and detained, including Jaime Hales, Eduardo Loyola and Roberto Morales, were brutally beaten by the police. Five journalists from the newspapers ""El Mercurio"" and ""Las Ultimas Noticias"", the radio stations ""Portales"" and ""Cooperativas Vitalicias"" and the weekly publication ""Hoy"" were injured.\n.The President of the CNS, Mr. Bustos, was also brutally beaten by the police and hospitalised in an emergency medical centre. He was later taken away from the CNS headquarters by police officers in civilian clothing.\n.On  December, the Chilean Government admitted that Manuel Bustos was being held at police investigation premises but prohibited his family, friends and lawyers from contacting him.\n.On  December the arbitrary expulsion from the country was ordered of Manuel Bustos and of Hector Cuevas, President of the Confederation of Building workers. They were landed at Rio de Janeiro, where Hector Cuevas had to be hospitalised for treatment of injuries inflicted upon him by the Chilean police.\n.Furthermore, on  December the Government banished the following five trade unionists arrested on  December to the inhospitable northern region of the country: Elmiro Antonio Aravena Lastra was sent to Monte Patria, Juan de Dios Alvarez to Paiguana, Roberto Antonio Jimnez Villa Nueva to Inca de Oro, Sergio David Mancilla Marin to Taltal and Victor Enrique Caripillan Paine to Quillagua.\n.In a letter dated  January, the WFTU confirms these facts and adds that the union leaders who were expelled from the country were taken to Pudahuel international airport without being able to collect their clothes or personal effects since their expulsion took place after their arrest. Manuel Bustos\' passport was returned to him only in the aircraft prior to his arrival in Brazil.\n.The WCL, in a letter dated  January , also denounces the arbitrary expulsion of the two trade unionists purely on trade union grounds.\n.Furthermore, the National Trade Unions Confederation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials industries of , Chile, in its communication of  December , points out that Jose Figueroa, a union official in charge of the Confederation\'s international relations, was arrested and tortured for two days and brutally beaten on  December during the above-mentioned demonstration in the Plaza Artesanos and that Efrain Plaza Plaza, President of the Trade Union of Building workers, Technicians and Managerial Staff, was beaten by plain-clothed police officers, detained at Santiago central police station for five days and had to undergo surgery.\n.Furthermore, in subsequent communications in March , the WFTU and the ICFTU denounces the arrest of the wife and three children of Hector Cuevas on  March , in front of the Presidential Palace of the Moneda in Santiago as they were carrying placards calling for his return to the country. The complainants state that they were released, but that Mrs. Cuevas has again been threatened with arrest and her children with expulsion from school.\n.Finally, the ICFTU states that in January  the Appeals Court accepted a petition for amparo (habeas corpus) which had been lodged by Manuel Bustos and authorised him to return to the country. However, the military government introduced an appeal against this decision which prevented Manuel Bustos from exercising his right to live in his homeland. The ICFTU adds that the two expulsions are not exceptional and encloses a partial list of the names of  trade union leaders who ace currently living in exile.\n.In an initial communication dated  February , the Government confirmed that Manuel Bustos had in fact been arrested and exiled by Decree No.  of  December  in application of article  (transitory) of the Constitution and that Supreme Decree No.  of  December  prohibited him from returning to the country.\n.The Government explained that Manuel Bustos had submitted three petitions for habeas corpus (amparo) to the Appeals Court of Santiago. The first, dated  March, was rejected;']"

The police intervened to break up the meeting of the persons who had gathered. As regards this matter the Secretary of State for the Interior pointed out that a minimum principle of authority necessitated an intervention in a reunion which had not been authorised. He also emphasised that the police had acted moderately and in a correct manner. Some  people, amongst whom was the trade union leader for the railway sector, Ernesto Vogel, were arrested for an identity and residence check. They were all released the same day without having been interrogated even if some of them are being charged before the local police court for breach of the peace in addition, some of the demonstrators held a meeting in a church whence they withdrew peacefully without any intervention on the part of the police. The leaders of  trade union organisations issued a tract to the workers in which they examined various aspects of the social and trade union situation and in which it is indicated that authorisation to hold a meeting on the occasion of  May had been refused for the fifth year running.\n.The Committee notes that the persons arrested on the occasion of the demonstration organised on  May were immediately released. It must however express its regret at the fact that the Government did not authorise a meeting requested by a large number of trade union leaders. In fact, as the Committee has already indicated as regards the prohibition of a meeting which certain trade union organisations wished to organise on  May , trade unions should have the right to freely organise meetings which they wish on the occasion of Labour Day provided that they respect the measures taken by the authorities to ensure public order.\n.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the detention or the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists:(i) to regret that the information provided by the Government does not permit it to note that any progress has been made as to the supply of information on the persons in question and to request the Government to continue its investigations in order that these persons might be traced;(ii) to request the Government to transmit information on the results of the judicial proceedings that are taking place regarding these persons;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the transfer of some trade unionists, to note that all the trade unionists concerned have regained their freedom, and to decide that no purpose would be served in pursuing further its examination of this aspect of the case;(c) as regards the allegations concerning the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from trade union leaders in exile, to suggest to the Government that it should, in the spirit of the amnesty that has recently been decreed, re-examine the measure which affects Mr. Meneses and Mr. Araneda;(d) as regards the allegations concerning the measures affecting certain trade union leaders:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  concerning the obligation on trade union leaders to belong to the occupation represented by their organisation and the removal from office of trade union leaders by administrative authority;(ii) to request the Government to intervene with a view to the reinstatement of those concerned in their trade union functions and, in the case of dismissal, in their employment;(iii) to request the Government to transmit the text of the judgement to be handed down in the case of Mr. Juan Fincheira, Mr. Milton Paga, Mr. Carlos Arellano and Mr. Arturo Latuz.(e) with regard to the allegations concerning the events which took place on  May, to note that the persons arrested have been released, but to express its regret that the Government did not authorise a meeting requested by a large number of trade union leaders, and to stress that trade unions should have the right to freely hold meetings which they wish on the occasion of Labour Day provided that they respect public order;(f) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.\n.The Committee examined this case in February, May and November  and in February, May and November . It submitted an interim report at each of these sessions.\n.Since it last examined the case the Committee has received a number of communications from complainant organisations: one (dated  November ) from the World Federation of Trade Unions, three (dated  November and  December  and  January ) from the World Confederation of Labour, one (dated  November ) from the Industrial Federation of Building, Wood and Building Materials Workers (FIEMC), one (dated  November ) from the National Federation of Metalworkers' Unions (FENSIMET), one (dated  December ) from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), and one (dated  December ) from the Trade unions international of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries (UIBWM).\n.These allegations were transmitted to the Government as and when they were received. The Government has supplied information in letters dated  December ,  and  January and  February .\n.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In reply to the allegations made earlier, the Government had supplied certain information, and had stated on several occasions that nobody was or had been under arrest on account of his status as a trade unionist or his trade union activities, but for breaches of the law or for reasons of public order.\n.In November  the Committee noted with deep regret that the Government had not supplied any new information concerning the alleged arrest or disappearance of the many persons named in the complaints. The Committee had, however, been informed that following the submission of new evidence to substantiate the claim that these persons had been arrested, the Supreme Court had decided to reopen the inquiry into, in particular, the disappearance of  serving or former trade union officials named in these complaints.\n.The Committee expressed the hope that the investigations would be carried out diligently and in full independence. More generally, as concerns all the allegations of disappearances, the Committee urged the Government to carry out thorough inquiries into these cases, in respect of most of which the complainants had supplied additional information, including eye-witness accounts, to substantiate their claim that the persons in question had been arrested.\n.The Committee further noted with regret that the recommendations for the continuance of the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn did not appear to have been complied with. The Committee considered that the witnesses' testimony compiled by the Ad Hoc Working Group established by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the organization of American States sufficed to show the need for reopening the inquiry into this matter and continuing it until the person or persons responsible were found.\n.The Government had likewise failed to reply to the allegations concerning the temporary arrest of certain trade union officials: Samuel Astorga, Eduardo Berros Morales and Ramn Velasquez.\n.On the Committee's recommendation, the Governing Body, inter alia, requested the Government to supply information on the situation of the persons named in the list annexed to the th Report. It requested that the competent authorities continue the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, and asked the Government to forward as speedily as possible its comments on the arrest of the persons named in paragraph  above.\n.The FENSIMET subsequently alleged, in its letter of  November , that the caretaker of its union headquarters, Juan Montecinos Montecinos, had been kept in custody for six hours. The persons who arrested him had produced no warrant for his arrest, and he had allegedly been severely tortured. The complainant organisation had filed a protest with the Ministry of the Interior; an inquiry had been ordered, but it had not yet been discovered who was responsible for the torturing.\n.As concerns the persons alleged to have disappeared, the Government stated in its letter of  January  that the Ministry of Labour and Social welfare had set up, jointly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a co-ordination Committee for the collation of evidence, since most of the names mentioned also appeared in similar complaints filed with other international organisations. All the available information would be sent with the report requested for  April .\n.With regard to the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, the Government repeated that the Valparaiso courts had undertaken an inquiry and had adjourned the case on  February , in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. No new evidence had come to light and the case had not been reopened.\n.The Government denied that Samuel Astorga, Eduardo Berros and Ramn Velasquez had ever been arrested; the first named was not and"", 'General Secretary of the said body. However, this illegal work stoppage was rejected and was not joined by several major union organisations. On  April when the paralysis of activities was called, violent acts took place, such as the destruction of an underground railway wagon; the assault of the driver of a public transport vehicle which resulted in him receiving bullet wounds; the shooting of police officers by two persons planting explosives in the Quinta Normal commune; the theft, ransacking and destruction of medical consultancy rooms in the ""Joao Goulart"" suburb of La Granga; an explosion in the San Bernardo municipality causing serious damage; electricity cuts caused by the toppling of all high tension cable towers; the attack on, robbery and ransacking of merchandise in the ""San Miguel"" shopping centre in La Granga by  persons who also broke windows; the stoning and attempted ransacking of a butchery, a bottleshop and a bakery in San Miguel commune; at the cross-section of Central Avenue and Las Industrias Street, at . p.m. a group of  persons led by five heavily armed individuals whose faces were hidden by hoods broke into the above-mentioned medical clinic owned by the municipality and demolished a wall, intimidated the guards, stole the milk destined for pregnant women and lactating mothers, sacks of rice and other food which the municipality gave to the needy and to those having few resources, medicines which were distributed to patients free of charge and medical equipment and broke down doors and shattered windows and glass. The damage to private property, public buildings and individuals surpassed  million pesos (US$. million) without counting the  million pesos represented by the damage to the  electricity towers and electrical distribution installations.\n.The Government states that, given the alarming situation produced by the enormous destruction of private property and the Government\'s duty to protect law and order and citizens\' safety which were seriously affected by these acts, it was decided that the public authority, the Governor of the Interior, would petition the courts to summon Diego Olivares, Sergio Aguirre, Nicanor Araya, Manuel Jimnez and Moiss Labraa in relation to any responsibility they could have in inciting and promoting all types of activities aimed at the collective interruption and suspension of work and stoppages and strikes in public services, production, transport and commerce. This would be a crime under section () of Act No. . on State Security which had been promulgated in  when the Government of Carlos Ibaez del Campo was in power. The petition was lodged on  April  with the secretariat of the Criminal Court of Appeal of Santiago. That court appointed an examining magistrate who questioned and took the statements of the five persons involved and who, on  May , laid charges against Messrs. Olivares, Aguirre and Araya on the grounds that there was reason to believe that they had taken part in the crime set out in section  of Act No. .; at the same time he released them on bail amounting to over , pesos (about US$.). Messrs. Labraa and Jimnez were released unconditionally. The defence counsel for the accused announced that they would appeal the magistrate\'s decision to bring charges and they had five days in which to lodge the appeal. As regards the sentence of the Appeal Court, the affected parties can make a request for a writ of certiorari to correct any errors or abuses committed by the judges and have the sentence amended. Such a writ is heard by the Supreme Court.\n.In its communication of  May , the Government provides information on the present legal status of unionists Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez; during this month of May, Messrs. Bustos\' and Martinez\' lawyers filed an appeal to the Chamber of Accusations, asking that their banishment be rescinded, that they be transferred to Santiago and that they be allowed to serve the remainder of their sentence on nights. The Chamber of Accusations dismissed that request as lapsed. The defence attorneys further appealed to the Santiago Appeals Court, which unanimously upheld the decision of the Chamber of Accusations. The Government adds that neither Messrs. Bustos and Martnez nor their lawyers appealed to the President of the Republic or to the Minister of Justice, to obtain the presidential clemency for the remainder of their sentence. The Government points out that a privilege can only be granted or denied if the persons concerned request it, and that it cannot grant or deny something that the would-be beneficiaries did not ask.\n.As regards the ban on entering the country imposed on Rolando Caldern Aranguiz, Hernado del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro, the Committee notes with interest that in September  these persons returned to the country where they are now residing; as regards trade union leader Luis Meneses Aranda, the Committee observes that the Government states that under article  of the Political Constitution, persons who have lost Chilean nationality may be rehabilitated by a law and that Mr. Meneses Aranda has not initiated any proceedings in this respect. In this connection, the Committee would request the Government to keep it informed of any proceedings for recovery of his nationality which may be initiated by this union leader and requests the complainant to inform it precisely of his present situation.\n.As regards the legal situation of union leaders Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez, sentenced to banishment, the Committee notes that there has been no change in their legal situation. It recalls that the detention and sentencing of union leaders in connection with activities related to the protection of workers\' interests endanger the free exercise of trade union rights. In the light of the last information provided by the Government, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to lift the terms of banishment imposed on leaders Bustos and Martnez.\n.As regards the allegations concerning the journalist Juan Pablo Crdenas, the Committee notes the Government\'s information to the effect that Mr. Crdenas is not a party in any proceedings and he has not been convicted.\n.As regards the allegation concerning proceedings against union leader Florencio Valenzuela, the Committee notes that Mr. Valenzuela was fined, together with other detainees, and was released on the same day by the Third Local Police Court of Valparaso and that no proceedings are pending against him; the Committee also notes that the proceedings initiated by the College of Professors of Iquique and by the police, respectively, which are now under way before the military courts, as a result of the events which occurred during the celebration of International Labour Day in , have been referred to the First Court of Appeal of Iquique. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the development of these court proceedings.\n.As regards the collective bargaining process in the Curtiembre Interamericana enterprise, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government to the effect that this was completed on  October , with acceptance by the workers involved of the employer\'s final offer.\n.As regards the various allegations presented by the National Confederation of Federations and Unions of Workers in the Food, Restaurant, Hotel and Allied Trades (CTGACH), the Committee takes due note of the detailed information supplied by the Government, in particular as regards the proceedings before the appeal court initiated by Mr. Luis Bentez Galaz, leader of the Inter-Enterprise Union of Workers in the Culinary Arts, against his former employer in order to recover the benefits ordered to be paid to him. The Committee also observes that, according to the information supplied by the Government, the reinstatement proceedings initiated by union leaders Angel Cataln and Juan Montalbn are still under way; the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the development of these proceedings.\n.As regards the reinstatement proceedings initiated by a group of workers and union leaders dismissed in connection with a stoppage of work affecting the state railway enterprise, the Committee notes that in one of the trials  workers withdrew their suit with the agreement of the enterprise and that trade unionists Jos Ortega and Jos Morales also withdrew their claim with the approval of the enterprise. It also notes that trade unionists Andrs Salinas and Guillermo Munizaga have been reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the proceedings initiated by the other dismissed trade unionists, namely: Jos Criado, Chairman of the National Federation of Railway Workers; Germn Daz, Secretary of the Federation; Miguel Muoz, its Secretary-General; Ceferino Barra, Chairman of No.  Union; Juan Daz, Secretary of that union; Rafael Rivera, its Treasurer; Ren Vilches, Director of No.  Union of San Bernardo; Oscar Cabello, Director of that union ; Tito Ramrez, Secretary of Trade Union No.  of Santiago; Juan Contreras, Chairman of the No.  Traction Union; Orlando Gahona, Treasurer of that union; and Ivn Orellana and Luis Pradenas, both directors of that union.\n.As regards the allegations of unfair practices by the Via del Mar Municipal Corporation against the Inter-Enterprise Union of Education Officials of the Fifth Region,', 'had never been, according to the Government, a trade union official; he had been a Member of Parliament until .\n.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government concerning the three persons named in the preceding paragraph, but observes that it is in complete contradiction with the allegations referring to their arrest.\n.The Committee draws the attention of the complainant organisations to this reply.\n.Furthermore, the Government has not yet replied to the allegations concerning the temporary arrest of the caretaker of the FENSIMET\'s headquarters and the ill-treatment he is said to have suffered.\n.As concerns the circumstances of the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, the Committee had previously drawn attention to certain discrepancies between the Government\'s statements and the evidence taken from various witnesses, and had recommended that the inquiry be continued.\n.The Committee is bound to observe that this recommendation has not been acted upon, and it deplores the fact that, as a result, it is impossible for it to form an opinion in full knowledge of the facts on such a serious aspect of this case.\n.The Committee further regrets that the Government\'s recent communications contain no information with respect to the many persons named by the complainants as having been arrested or disappeared, whereas the Committee had hoped to obtain particulars, inter alia, as to the results of the further investigations undertaken by the Supreme Court into the disappearance of  serving or former trade union officials. More generally, the Government had been requested to carry out thorough inquiries into the cases of disappearance. But the Government\'s reply is that it will supply all the available information by  April .\n.The Committee appends to this report a list of the persons in respect of whom information - or further information - has been requested from the Government but not yet supplied, and urges the Government to supply detailed particulars as to the situation of these persons.\n.Several trade union organisations (WFTU, WCL, FIEMC, FENSIMET, CLAT and UIBWM) have referred to the arrest and subsequent assignment to forced residence of the following seven trade union officials: Carlos Frez Rojo, President of the National Port Workers\' Federation and the Unitarian Workers\' Front; Arturo Latuz Favi, Director of the Copper Manual Workers\' Union (""El Teniente"" Mine); Milton Puga, Director of the Copper Salaried Employees\' Union (""El Teniente"" Mine); Juan Fincheira, President of the Copper Salaried Employees\' Union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and Metallurgy Workers; Juan Manuel Sepulveda, Vice-President of the FENSIMET; Carlos Arellano, Director of the Copper Manual Workers\' Union, and Hctor Hugo Cuevas Salvador, PRESIDENT of the FIEMC. According to the Government, they have been assigned to forced residence ""for having engaged in political agitation in the trade union field and organised acts of indiscipline at work completely incompatible with national security"". According to the complainants, these persons have been victimised for exercising trade union rights, although their activities formed part of their trade union duties as representatives of their organisations and of the workers, and their demands related to conditions of work.\n.The complainants have drawn attention to the plunge in the purchasing power of wages and the blatant inadequacy of the adjustments granted on the ground of inflation. They have also referred to arbitrary dismissals, unfair treatment by employers, lack of freedom to organise, hold meetings, elect representatives in full freedom, submit pay claims, negotiate improved conditions and go on strike, and the problem of unemployment in town and country. Petitions addressed to the Government by trade union organisations, they continued, had gone unanswered, and requests to see officials had been refused; on the contrary, the unions were accused of engaging in politics and behaving unpatriotically.\n.According to these organisations, the banished union officials were merely doing their duty and endeavouring to carry out faithfully the mandate given to them by the workers; they did not organise any work stoppages nor engage in subversive activities; while there may have been a few instances of indiscipline at work, they arose out of problems still unsolved. The complainants added that it was not by banishing, nor imprisoning, nor threatening people that these problems could be solved.\n.The complainants went on to state that the workers at the ""El Teniente"" Mine, those at the port of Valparaiso, building workers, metalworkers and others had been seeking wage increases. Immediately following the El Teniente miners\' strike  workers had been dismissed. The complainants pointed out that the trade unionists assigned to forced residence had been separated from their families and deprived of means of subsistence and medical supplies in an inhospitable region subject to extremes in temperature in the north of the country. In conclusion, one of the complainant organisations requested that a representative of the Director-General be sent to Chile as a matter of urgency.\n.In several communications the Government stated that the trade union officials mentioned in paragraph  had been assigned on  November  to forced residence in towns in the north of the country for breaches of the legal provisions in force. They had been freed on  December  by Decree No.  of  December  (of which the Government supplies a copy), issued by the Ministry of the Interior, and returned to their homes.\n.The Committee notes with interest the release of these persons. It observes, however, that the penalty of assignment to forced residence was imposed on them without any judicial proceedings having been initiated against them, and that the Government has not specified the offences of which they were accused.\n.As the Committee has already had occasion to point out in earlier cases, although the fact of exercising trade union activity or holding trade union office does not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the absence of guarantees of due process of law may lead to abuses and allow trade union officials to be penalised pursuant to decisions based on groundless accusations. It may also create a climate of insecurity and fear which may be prejudicial to the exercise of trade union rights.\n.In a more recent communication (dated  January ), the WCL referred to the assignment to forced residence of the following trade unionists: Georgina Aceituno, Juan Sepulveda, Hernn Mery and Samuel Astorga.\n.In its communication of  February the Government states that these measures of assignment were taken by virtue of the special powers conferred on the President of the Republic by Decree No.  of , in conformity with the Constitution of . They do not amount to penal sanctions. The powers thus conferred on the President of the Republic are subject to the control of the courts. The Court of Appeal of Santiago has been seized of appeals lodged by persons affected. The court confirmed the powers of the President and the measures taken. The court, however, decided that the Government should not have fixed the place of residence of those persons in the province to which they were assigned. They themselves had the right to choose their place of residence within that province. All the persons concerned had chosen to settle in Arica.\n.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government concerning this matter. It notes, however, that the Government does not state the precise reason for which the measures in question were taken. The Committee would like to request the Government to provide information in this connection.\n.The WFTU had alleged that a number of trade union officials had been harassed in connection with their activities on the occasion of May Day . These officials, who had signed a document entitled ""Analysis and Aspirations of Chilean Workers after  Months of Military Government"" (submitted to the Government on May Day), stated that after that date ""overt, illegal and abusive pressure"" had been brought to bear on the leaders who had associated themselves with this document. Submissions under the amparo procedure had been filed by some officials whose organisations were signatories to the document; they had been followed by vehicles and by persons in civilian clothes; the premises of their organisations or their homes were being kept under surveillance; some of them had received a series of anonymous telephone calls. The WFTU mentioned the names of the following officials: Hctor Hugo Cuevas Salvador, Fernando Bobadilla Pisani, Ricardo Celedonio Lecaros Gonzlez and Sergio de Jests Villalobos.\n.The WFTU also referred to the Government\'s refusal to allow the celebration of May Day  to be organised by  trade union organisations.\n.In the absence of any reply from the Government concerning these various allegations, the Governing Body requested it in November  to forward its comments on these matters as speedily as possible.\n.In its letter of  January , the Government stated that the trade union organisations had celebrated May Day in  with a combined mass demonstration in which the most important Chilean Confederations, federations, associations and unions had taken part.\n.The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied fuller information on these aspects of the case. It wishes to emphasise that the holding of public meetings and the voicing of demands']"

The state copper enterprise adds that, at the time of the dismissals,  per cent of the workers were trade union members and were registered with the primary trade union affiliated to the CTC (to date these figures still stand)); (ii) regarding the move to reprimand the Gardilcic Andina trade union,  per cent of the associates requested the Labour Inspectorate to provide a certifying officer to take part in the process of reprimanding the union leadership. After a public notice of a meeting had been posted, a decision to reprimand the union leadership was adopted by a vote on  November  (in which  men and  women participated). The Government explains that the Labour Inspectorate does not interfere in the validation of the grounds of a reprimand and that, in the event of false accusations, it is the responsibility of the organization itself to annul the reprimand or adopt measures to resolve any conflict arising within the organization. All requests to annul a leadership reprimand are dealt with by the labour courts; (iii) the illegal replacement of striking workers participating in the collective bargaining process of the integral services was recorded by the Chaara Labour Inspectorate and reported to the Directorate of Labour, which, in turn, submitted a complaint of anti-union practices to the Labour Court, which resulted in an agreement approved by the court on  March  and the closure of the case on  May ; and (iv) as for the allegation that the maintenance service contractor in the El Teniente division refused to engage in collective bargaining, it did so under section  of the existing Labour Code, that is to say it raised an objection relating to time limits and a lack of opportunity to enter into bargaining, which was accepted by the Rancagua Labour Inspectorate.\n.With regard to the possible effects of the CTC s criticism of the labour reform, the Government understands that the organization has a legitimate right to disagree with the Government s views when the latter introduces legislation on collective bargaining and to promote a complete revision of Chapter IV of the Labour Code.\n.The enterprise denies the allegations that it used direct or indirect psychological pressure or physical force on workers during the bargaining process, and submits that the general accusations levelled against it are not based on specific facts, but on assertions of interference by the State in this regard. The enterprise also denies having committed acts of union interference, reiterating that these, too, are unsubstantiated accusations. With regard to the mass dismissals of the contracting enterprises' workers who were involved in the strike, the enterprise, as the principal in the subcontracting system, states that it does not intervene in the dismissals of the contracting enterprises' employees. Its sole interaction with the contracting enterprises is limited to establishing, in advance, the tendering terms which are ultimately transferred to the resulting civil-law contract, which are also signed by the contracting enterprises, as any further involvement in the management and administration of each enterprise s human resources would be inappropriate. The enterprise states that the complaint does not contain any factual evidence of collaboration to undermine trade union activity and that, to the contrary, it has acted as a mediator or facilitator of agreements and intervened only when it was possible to promote agreement between the parties which might be linked to matters within its remit as principal, without interfering in trade union or worker organization matters in the processes mentioned above.\n.With respect to the public monument in memory of Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, the Government indicates that the situation which arose during the process to authorize its construction stemmed from the actions or decisions of either the Council for National Monuments or the Ministry of National Assets, in which the enterprise played no part. Although the authorization and putting in place of the memorial undermined the legitimate exercise of a right in rem associated with the mining easement owned exclusively by the enterprise, the monument has been built and set up in that location without waiting for the orders which revoked the authorization.\n.The Committee notes that, in this case, the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC), which comprises workers in a subordinate and dependent relationship with contracting enterprises of the enterprise, denounces the excessive use of police force during a lawful strike held between  July and  August , that resulted in the death of a worker, and it also alleges that during negotiations to improve and expand the framework agreement concluded in  between the CTC, the enterprise and the contracting enterprises, various anti-union practices occurred in several of these enterprises.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the complainant: (i) on  August , a framework agreement was concluded between the CTC, the enterprise and the contracting enterprises (according to the complainant, the enterprise, dominates the contracting enterprises); (ii) this framework is the only supra-enterprise collective instrument that embodies rights and obligations relating to the workers' remuneration and social protection;; (iii) although the framework agreement does not specify a renewal date, it was extended through negotiations in ,  and , that is to say within the minimum periods established in the national legislation for the renewal of collective instruments, meaning that negotiations should have been conducted in ; and (iv) on  July , the CTC submitted an application for the enforcement, improvement and extension of the agreement and, faced with the reluctance of the enterprise and its contracting enterprises to start the negotiation process (they argued that the negotiations should be held in , not , and that the enterprise was facing a difficult economic situation due to internal production conditions and the low price of copper), the CTC launched a lawful strike on  July .\n.In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s contention that: (i) the drop in the price of copper has significantly affected the copper industry in recent years, leading to job losses and the discontinuance of projects and investments; (ii) Chilean legislation recognizes only one binding and compulsory level of negotiation: the enterprise level (supra-enterprise negotiation is essentially voluntary); (iii) while the framework agreement between the enterprise, the contracting enterprises and the CTC was concluded on  August , the complementary agreements negotiated in ,  and  were concluded between the CTC and the contracting enterprises which form the Professional Association of Mining Enterprises and Related Industries (AGEMA). The enterprise participated in these negotiations only as a facilitator and guarantor; and (iv) on  July , the CTC broached the possibility of direct negotiation with the enterprise, thus breaking with the parties' previous practice. On being faced with this situation, the enterprise responded that this request should be settled directly between the contract workers, their representative trade union organizations and the respective enterprises employing them, at which point the CTC began to put pressure on the state enterprise, calling a stoppage that would result in the occupation of facilities and the blocking of a public road.\n.In relation to the alleged excessive use of police force during a lawful strike held between  July and  August , that resulted in the death of a worker, the Committee notes that, according to the CTC, the Government and the police report annexed to the complaint, on  July, the Chilean paramilitary police force carried out an operation in the El Salvador division, which resulted in the death of the worker Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, who died of a gunshot wound in the early hours of the next day. The Committee notes that according to the CTC and the Government, two investigations are being conducted in order to clarify the circumstances surrounding his death: one by the paramilitary police force (which, according to the complainant, lacks credibility, legitimacy and impartiality) and another by the Public Prosecutor s Office, in which the CTC is the complainant. The Committee notes that to date, both investigations are ongoing. It also notes the Government s statement that, with a view to further clarifying the facts, the National Human Rights Institute has filed a criminal complaint against those responsible for the death of the worker Nelson Quichillao Lpez. The Committee recalls that in cases in which the dispersal of public meetings by the police has involved loss of life or serious injury, the Committee has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated immediately through an independent inquiry and to a regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification for the action taken by the police and to determine responsibilities (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ). The Committee deeply regrets the death of the worker Nelson Quichillao Lpez and urges the Government to keep"", 'meeting especially called for this purpose at which an Inspector of Labour or Notary must be present. The decision to affiliate must be reviewed every two years and decisions to collect trade union contributions by federations and Confederations must be ratified by first degree general meetings to be of effect.\n.The Government indicates finally, that it will provide more detailed information on the new trade union legislation for the next session of the Committee, since by then it will be in a position to give exact details of the content of the standards to be adopted once all the opinions have been heard.\n.The Committee notes the statement of the Minister of Labour according to which the new trade union legislation is due to be adopted before  June . The Committee considers, in the light of the information provided by the Government, that the main principles underlying this legislation should permit the adoption of provisions ensuring greater respect of the principles of freedom of association than those which were in force. In addition, the Committee notes with interest that provisions have been adopted with a view to guaranteeing freedom of assembly for trade union organisations. It also notes that a legislative decree to facilitate the collection of trade union contributions has been promulgated.\n.The Committee will not, however, be able to express its opinion in full knowledge of the facts as to whether the new trade union legislation is in conformity with the generally recognised principles on the matter until it is in possession of the complete text of the relevant provisions. The Committee notes in this regard the assurance given by the Government that more detailed information will be provided for its next session. In this context, and bearing in mind the concerns expressed within the ILO in regard to the trade union situation in Chile, the Committee cannot overemphasise the importance of its being able to examine the provisions of the legislation before their envisaged promulgation in June . It therefore expresses the firm hope that the Government will be in a position, for its next session, to provide it with all the information necessary for a thorough examination of the draft legislation as well as the measures envisaged by the Government for implementing the new law.\n.In the meantime, the Committee considers it useful to recall the recommendations formulated by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission respecting the adoption of new trade union legislation. The Commission had considered that such legislation should, to be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association enshrined in the Constitution of the ILO and in order to be able to ratify the freedom of association Conventions, should recognise, in particular, the following principles:\n.The Committee must also stress the value of systematic and thorough consultation of employers\' and workers\' organisations in the course of drafting trade union legislation. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Minister of Labour held talks with leaders representing various trends in the trade union movement as well as with employers\' representatives.\n.Finally, the Committee must point out that it would be highly desirable for the new legislation to be implemented in full as rapidly as possible so as to put an end to the major restrictions which have been imposed on trade union organisations since .II. Trade union activities(a) Collective bargaining.In a speech delivered in October , the Minister of Labour had indicated that the country was preparing to restore collective bargaining in a new and modern way which would render it more effective in a really free society. According to the Minister, such progress had been made possible by the success with which the Government and the people of Chile had overcome the economic catastrophe in the country. Collective bargaining would take place at the level of the undertaking.\n.In a speech delivered in October , the Minister of Labour had indicated that the country was preparing to restore collective bargaining in a new and modern way which would render it more effective in a really free society. According to the Minister, such progress had been made possible by the success with which the Government and the people of Chile had overcome the economic catastrophe in the country. Collective bargaining would take place at the level of the undertaking.\n.At their November  Session, the Committee and the Governing Body had expressed the hope that, when restoring collective bargaining, the Government would take account of the principles expressed by the Committee concerning compulsory arbitration which would be contrary to freedom of association.\n.In presenting the Government\'s ""Social Plan"" at the beginning of January , the minister of Labour stated that what had to be aimed for was a system of collective bargaining which would be:- effective and just, which would suggest that it be conducted within each undertaking, without prejudice to the exceptions strictly necessary in the case of activities where such an arrangement would not be viable;- technical, which would require that both parties with full knowledge of the relevant factors involved and with the aid of any technical assistance required;- responsible and integrated, which can only be achieved within the framework of conciliation procedures since experience proved that mediation and arbitration arrangements did not enjoy the necessary confidence to facilitate equitable and peaceful solution of wage negotiations. Because of this, strikes proliferated to the extent that, instead of being the last resort in an unresolved conflict, they became a regular and immediate means of seeking a solution to such dispute. It is clear that striking cannot be legally accepted when it affects services in the public interest or when a work stoppage seriously impairs the population\'s health or food supplies, the country\'s economy or national security. In requiring compulsory arbitration in these cases, Chile is following the pattern prevailing in the most advanced democracies in this field. On the other hand, the situation is different in undertakings where strikes do not have such effects on society and where the problem is confined to a dispute between employers and workers without vitally affecting the State or the population. In these cases, there is nothing preventing the possibility of occupational strikes and lock-outs.\n.In winding up this point, the Minister of Labour pointed out that his statements on collective bargaining did not concern employees of the State and municipalities. Finally, he indicated that the legislation respecting collective bargaining would enter into force before  June .\n.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government on this point, in particular regarding the early adoption of new legislation on collective bargaining. The Committee also notes with interest that, according to the statements of the Minister of Labour, the procedure of compulsory arbitration would not be applied to all collective labour disputes, contrary to what had been previously announced, but only to limited cases.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the re-establishment of collective bargaining which the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission had already declared to be a general aspiration of trade union circles, will be effective in the very near future. In the opinion of the Committee, this would constitute an important factor in improving industrial relations in the country.\n.The Committee noted nevertheless that, according to the statement of the Minister of Labour, the framework for collective bargaining will be mainly at the level of the undertaking. In this regard, the Committee considers it useful to point out that the law should not stand in the way of the participation of federations and Confederations in voluntary collective negotiations concerning conditions of work.(b) Allegations concerning collective labour disputes\n.Some of the complainant organisations, and in particular the ICFTU and the WFTU, had referred to collective labour disputes which had recently taken place in Chile, particularly in the mining sector at Chuquicamata. The complainants explained that, after two years of fruitless action to obtain higher wages, the workers of Chuquicamata had submitted, on  August , a list of the following social and economic demands: a  per cent increase in wages, an increase in the residence allowance, an increase in the production bonus and scholarships for children who were studying. The management of the public mining undertaking reacted by dismissing trade union leaders who had taken part in the assembly during which the list of demands had been approved. In protest against these measures and against the prices of meals in the undertaking, the miners began what has been known as the ""canteen strike"", refusing to take their meals in the canteens of the undertaking.\n.Following this movement, the Government declared a state of siege throughout the province. This measure had various consequences, in particular the obligation to submit a duly justified written request for the holding of any meeting or assembly, to be presented  hours in advance to the Garrison Commander. Movements of persons within the province and leaving the province were controlled, as was entry to the mines, to which only the workers were allowed access. In addition, workers were arrested, sent to a remote part of the country, or placed under house arrest.\n.In', ""is around  per cent of all its workers. If the rate of union membership among supervisors is not similar to that of List B workers (operators), this is due solely and exclusively to the personal decision of the workers who carry out those functions. There is no interference by the enterprise in that decision-making process.\n.The enterprise states that it has signed agreements with the complainant on a number of occasions, which is why it cannot understand the claim of discriminatory treatment between FESUC and the FTC. The courts also reached this same conclusion in two of the four judicial proceedings initiated by FESUC against the enterprise in which very similar allegations to those in this case were made. In two of the proceedings, the claim was rejected, dismissing the existence of discrimination between trade unions, and the other two proceedings are still ongoing.\n.With respect to the allegation that FESUC does not have the same level of influence as the FTC in the appointment of representatives to the enterprise s board, the enterprise indicates that, under its Corporate Governance Act No. , one of the two worker representatives on the board is appointed from a shortlist presented by the FTC (as the only organization representing List B workers) and one member is appointed from a shortlist put forward by ANSCO together with FESUC (both have to agree because both represent the enterprise s supervisors).\n.With regard to the alleged threats of dismissal, the enterprise states that, while its senior management publicly expressed the need to adjust its costs and number of supervisors as part of measures to respond to the period of economic difficulty it is facing, those statements were made against the backdrop of a depreciation in the price of copper, which is public knowledge and in no way represents anti-union conduct. In the circumstances, the mining companies have had to reduce their costs to optimize their operations. The enterprise s divisions agreed, in their collective instruments, on the so-called  redundancy packages'  which include a series of benefits well above the level of those that workers would be legally entitled to receive on termination of service, as an incentive for them to leave.\n.The enterprise states that there were no threats of job losses because of worker participation in trade unions or in activities organized by them, and that the reasons for adjusting staff numbers are related to market changes and to the difficult economic situation the enterprise is facing, and thus in no way constitute threats of job losses associated with the exercise of freedom of association by List A workers. The termination of  unionized workers at the national level can in no way be qualified as arbitrary and was never intended to affect the freedom of association of FESUC or the trade unions affiliated to it. In that context, in October , each division began reducing its numbers of supervisors, which in some cases involved supervisor redundancies or, in others, dismissals owing to the enterprise s need to adjust staff numbers to respond to requirements. The enterprise highlights that the numbers of workers carrying out supervisor tasks at the national level actually rose by  per cent from  to date, increasing from , to ,. On the other hand, the total number of workers carrying out operator tasks fell by  per cent in the same period, as at the beginning of  the total number of operators was , and by the end of  it was ,. This situation, in addition to the fact that greater numbers of List B workers agreed to the redundancy packages, justified the fact that the reduction in staff numbers affected the supervisor category and not the operator category. Furthermore, the cost-reduction measures (with respect to reducing worker numbers) also affected another category in the enterprise, namely List E, which includes the enterprise s managers, who were affected by management restructuring in some of the divisions. Therefore, these measures were not centred solely on workers in the supervisor category.\n.The enterprise states that it did not engage in anti-union practices aimed at hindering the functioning of FESUC by changing its quorum at the time of the dismissal of  supervisors in October . It reports that the Andina division did not know which workers were going to stand as candidates in the election and that ultimately the termination of the employment contracts of  workers affiliated to the List A Supervisors Trade Union of Andina was made through voluntary redundancies. The workers opted for the redundancy package provided for in the collective agreement in force and agreed to change the grounds for termination to voluntary redundancy. The redundancy package was the workers' preferred option because it gave them access to greater benefits than the option of termination of services owing to the need to adjust staff numbers to the enterprise s requirements. Consequently, in accepting the redundancy package, the workers received, thanks to compensation calculated on years of service, sums of money greater than those agreed. The enterprise states that the workers, individually and after consultation with their trade union representatives, agreed to change the grounds for termination to voluntary redundancy. The enterprise also states that there has always been a high proportion of List A workers of the Andina division affiliated to trade union organizations of FESUC, which stands at  per cent. This is why  of these workers were affected.\n.With respect to the allegation of police intervention in the strike, the Government and the enterprise state that the eviction decree was issued by the provincial governor of El Loa to stop the trucks blocking access to the Radomiro Tomic division as part of a legal strike held by the List A Supervisors Trade Union of that workplace, in the context of a collective bargaining process at the end of . The enterprise indicates that the strikers prevented non-striking workers from entering the division, including workers from contracting and subcontracting enterprises. While the enterprise recognizes the right to strike, any strikes held must respect the rights of other workers of the enterprise and/or of contracting and subcontracting enterprises who, as they were not involved in the collective bargaining in question, had to provide the services for which they had been hired.\n.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant alleges that a national copper enterprise discourages supervisors from union membership; that the law discriminates against the complainant in the systems for representation on the enterprise s board; that the functioning of the complainant s trade unions has been hindered by the dismissal of hundreds of members; that the right to strike was violated through an eviction decree issued by the provincial governor; and that several trade union leaders were called in for questioning by the police in relation to their participation in a peaceful strike.\n.The Committee also observes that, in addition to those allegations, in the present complaint the complainant recalls allegations that were examined by the Committee in Case No.  presented by the same complainant organization in  [see st report of the Committee of March , paras ' ]. The Committee notes that, according to the complainant, the Government has not implemented the recommendations made by the Committee in that case, which referred to the need to take legislative measures in relation to articles ,  and  of the Labour Code. In this respect, the Committee notes the Government s statement that, on  April , that is to say after the presentation of the complaint, Act No.  entered into force, modernizing the labour relations system and reforming chapter IV of the Labour Code, and implementing the recommendations made by the Committee in Case No. , derogating, inter alia, articles ,  and  of the former text of chapter IV of the Labour Code. The Committee observes that, according to the Government, in its latest observations published in  in relation to the application of Conventions Nos  and , the CEACR noted with satisfaction the derogations of the provisions mentioned. The Committee welcomes the legislative changes derogating the provisions in line with its recommendations in Case No. .\n.With regard to the allegation that the enterprise discourages supervisors from union membership since they are in positions of trust (the complainant indicates that while List B workers (operators) have a union membership rate of  per cent, List A supervisors have a rate of . per cent), the Committee notes the enterprise s statement that: (i) it respects the exercise of freedom of association of all its workers, operators and supervisors alike, who are free to join a trade union organization of their choice, which is demonstrated by the high percentage of unionized workers in the enterprise of around  per cent of all its workers; (ii) it does not distinguish between trade union organizations, and FESUC (supervisors) and the FTC (operators) have participated in the various collective bargaining opportunities that have arisen over time; (iii) if the rate of union""]"
