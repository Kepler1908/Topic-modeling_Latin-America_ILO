In this respect, the Committee notes the different viewpoints of the complainants and the Government. On the one hand, the unions claim that the mere fact of adopting a clause to keep the minimum teaching salary higher than the minimum living wage by a specified proportion ( per cent) cannot mean that the teaching unions shall stop exercising their right to bargain collectively with regard to salaries and conditions of work. On the other hand, the Government considers that because of the clause regarding the automatic increase, there is no need to reopen discussions each year regarding the minimum teaching salary. The Committee also observes that the Governments position is consolidated with the adoption of Decree No. / amending certain sections, and abolishing others, of Decree No. /. The Committee observes that with these amendments the discussions no longer focus on salary issues, since the only requirement is the link between the minimum teaching salary and the minimum living wage.\n.The Committee wishes to recall that on several occasions it has drawn attention to the importance of promoting collective bargaining, as set out in Article  of Convention No. , in the education sector [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. While considering that it is not competent to express views on the level ?federal or provincial ?of collective bargaining, and noting the efforts made regarding the implementation of a framework agreement, the Committee also wishes to underline the special importance of salary matters in collective bargaining. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed on salary matters as part of the exercise of collective bargaining, in order to determine the scope of the clause for the automatic adjustment of the minimum teaching salary that the parties to the February  federal joint negotiations agreed on and to ensure that collective bargaining on salary remains possible at all levels.\n.The Committee notes that although both the complainants and the Government have mentioned various amparo appeals, no definitive decisions have yet been adopted on the issue of the federal joint negotiation board. The Committee requests the Government to forward the relevant judicial decisions, once they have been issued.\n.As regards the abovementioned Decree No. /, which, according to CTERA, entails the de facto abolition of the collective bargaining system at the national level in the education sector, the Committee notes that so far the Government has not supplied any information on the Decree. With regard to the allegation by CTERA that the new Decree disregards the key element of representativeness, the Committee is bound to note in this regard that section  of the Decree substantially alters the previous situation. It provides that the representation in the framework agreement of public sector education workers, in the provinces and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, shall be exercised by one member of each first-, second- and third-level organization having official trade union status and having nationwide geographical scope for teaching, and that if in the course of the negotiations there is no uniformity within the representation of the teachers?unions, that of the majority members shall prevail.\n.The Committee also observes that the reference to a list of information which must be in the possession of the parties, and considered to be the minimum necessary for undertaking the required discussions within the framework agreement, has been removed from section  of new Decree No. /. In this regard, the Committee recalls that Article  of the Collective Bargaining Recommendation,  (No. ), which complements Convention No.  ratified by Argentina, provides that measures adapted to national conditions should be taken, if necessary, so that the parties have access to the information required for meaningful negotiations. Hence, while observing the efforts made by the Government to undertake reforms in the education sector, the Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners to determine the appropriate representation of workers in the process of establishing the framework agreement provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ). It also requests the Government to ensure that the parties have the necessary information during the actual negotiations. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on this matter.\n.With regard to compulsory conciliation instigated by the Minister of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires, the Committee notes that CTERA denounces the use of compulsory conciliation (consisting of a mechanism in which the labour administrative authority summons the parties to the dispute to a forum for dialogue) as a tool for restricting the right to strike of education workers in the Province of Buenos Aires, since no industrial action may be taken during the period of compulsory conciliation. The Committee notes the indication by CTERA that the trade unions secured protective measures in their favour and that (as at April ) the matter was before the Provincial Supreme Court. The Committee notes the Governments indication that the main factor behind the summons to conciliation was the need to keep schools open since many of them also function as canteens. It also notes the Governments statement that the dispute was settled with the agreement of all teachers and professional organizations involved in the salary dispute in the Province of Buenos Aires (Act No. / dated  June ).\n.The Committee recalls that the provision of food to pupils of school age may be considered to be an essential service [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. It also recalls that it has examined several cases from Argentina involving objections to orders for compulsory conciliation between the parties to a dispute in the public education sector by the administrative authority, when the latter was a party in the dispute and that it has considered that it was necessary to entrust the decision of initiating the conciliation procedure in collective disputes to a body which is independent of the parties to the dispute (see thReport, Case No. , paragraph ).\n.As regards the classroom allowance, which forms part of the salary structure for private tutors, as established by law in the Province of Mendoza, the Committee notes the complainants objection that this salary element has been established for the purpose of obstructing the regular exercise of the right to strike by private tutors. The Committee notes the complainants allegation that if there is just one strike day in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay, and so the right to strike is penalized by an excessive loss of remuneration. The Committee notes the Governments reply indicating that the plaintiff brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court, though this was later withdrawn. The Committee also notes the Governments indication that: (i) the present denunciation is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity; and (ii)on the contrary, this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism.\n.The Committee observes that the classroom allowance mechanism does not in itself raise any issue relating to freedom of association. Nevertheless, it considers that it may have indirect repercussions with regard to salary deductions for strike days, where it involves a substantial loss of teaching salary for just a one-day stoppage or strike. On several occasions the Committee has considered that salary deductions for days of strike should only apply to workers who have taken part in the strike or a protest action and that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles [see Compilation, op. cit., paras & ]. However, in a case where the pay deductions were higher than the amount corresponding to the period of the strike, the Committee recalled that the imposition of sanctions for strike action was not conducive to harmonious labour relations [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. In the present case, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the classroom allowance mechanism operating in the Province of Mendoza does not give rise to excessive salary deductions for legitimate strike action. In view of the information provided by the Government, the Committee requests the complainant to indicate the reasons for withdrawing its claim of unconstitutionality concerning the classroom allowance.\n.With regard to the allegations by CTERA that the general secretary of SUTEBA, Mr Roberto Baradel, has become the target of death threats, directed at himself and his family, in relation to his role in collective bargaining in the sector which', 'in that the key element of representativeness is disregarded; (iii) there is no right to information on collective bargaining matters since a close examination of the Decree shows that it abolishes the right to information within the joint negotiation board for education itself (section ), thereby denying the unions knowledge of employment levels in the education sector, investment policies, programmes for the introduction of new technologies, etc.; and (iv) there is also no possibility of requesting the Ministry of Labour to set up a board for collective agreement negotiations since section  of Decree No. / has been abolished.\n.Lastly, CTERA denounces the brutal crackdown by the police in the city of Buenos Aires on  April  against education workers and union officials belonging to CTERA, some of whom were unlawfully arrested and subsequently released, for attempting to set up the Mobile School?at the Plaza de los Dos Congresos with a view to calling on the Government, in ways other than work stoppages, to convene a national joint negotiation board in the sector. It also claims that the head of State, when referring to the teachers?salary claims, made offensive comments about the education unions.\n.In a communication dated  April , the Government states that at no time was there non-compliance on its part which would justify the complaint presented by the UDA. On the contrary, considerable progress had occurred in relation to the previous situation.\n.Firstly, the Government makes a clarification regarding the reference to the national Government (to which the Ministry of Education and Sport belongs) as the employer? For the Government, this assertion is far removed from reality. In this regard, it explains that in the early s legislation adopted by the national Congress (Act No.  and complementary legislation) provided that educational establishments that had hitherto been under the auspices of the national Government would now be directly governed by the provinces. Hence the legislation provided at that time for the transfer to the provinces of educational establishments and their teaching and non-teaching staff that until then had been under national direction. Consequently, from that time onwards no educational establishments, or any of the teachers employed there, were any longer under the control of the national Government. Hence it is incorrect to describe the national Government as the employer? There are  different sets of regulations relating to teaching, each of them applicable in their respective area of jurisdiction. According to the Government, this demonstrates that the central government is not the employer? the employers are the provinces plus the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, each having its respective territory.\n.As regards the framework agreement (provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ) and referred to in point  of the collective agreement of February ), the Government indicates that it should not be forgotten that even if reference is made to a framework agreement? what is essential is the existence of agreements between the parties in each province. On that basis, from a position already fixed internally, discussions on the framework agreement can begin with the aim of reaching basic agreements at national level. The Government indicates that section  of Act No.  of January  (implemented by Decree No. /), provides as follows: The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (currently the Ministry of Education and Sport) together with the Federal Council for Culture and Education (currently the Federal Council for Education) and the teaching unions with national representation, shall conclude a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d) the teaching career. The Government explains that: (i) although no meetings were held from  to  for the purposes of formulating the framework agreement established in section of Act No.  ?there were only meetings at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary, which had been fixed by agreement with the unions in some cases, while other meetings had been prescribed by decree of the Executive Authority where there was no agreement ?this inaction ceased as from ; (ii) the foregoing does not alter the fact that it is a complicated, difficult task for the various regional jurisdictions, each having its own regulations relating to teachers, to reach basic agreements in relation to the creation of the framework agreement; and (iii) this whole situation goes far beyond the possibilities of the national Government, which depends on the decisions and policies of the various regional jurisdictions within the countrys federal system.\n.With regard to the minimum teaching salary (point  of the collective agreement of February ), namely the salary threshold below which no province may set the salary of any teacher, the Government explains that reaching agreement at that time on an automatic mechanism for increasing the minimum teaching salary was a significant step forward. The new mechanism agreed upon with the trade unions entails the automatic increase of the minimum salary, which is updated each year. This joint agreement establishes that the teaching salary must be at least  per cent higher than the minimum living wage, and this adjustment would be automatic, irrespective of any agreement reached in the joint negotiation board for education. For the Government, the clause regarding the automatic increase makes it unnecessary and merely academic to hold discussions on the minimum teaching salary each year. The automatic increase is calculated on the basis of the minimum living wage. This is fixed annually by the Council for the Minimum Living Wage, with the participation of workers, employers and representatives of the national Government and of the Federal Labour Council (provincial governments). Hence, in addition to the amount established annually as the general minimum wage by this Council, there is an extra  per cent as a fixed component of the minimum teaching salary for the year.\n.With regard to the Compensation Fund referred to in the complaint from the UDA, this is designed to complement (compensate) the earnings of teachers who do not reach the established minimum threshold. The aim is to help iron out disparities in the initial teaching salary in provinces where, despite financial input into the sector and greater efficiency in the allocation of resources, it is not possible to overcome those inequalities. This is separate from the FONID, which, simply providing incentives as its name suggests, has a totally different function from the Compensation Fund.\n.In a communication of March , the Government forwards information provided by the Ministry of Governance, Labour and Justice of the Province of Mendoza regarding the classroom allowance. It states that FLATEC brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court. However, it was withdrawn by the plaintiff. According to the Government, this demonstrates a lack of coherence in that the union renounced any local ruling but decided to pursue the matter at the international level in the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association. It also indicates that: (i) the Province of Mendoza is experiencing a severe financial emergency; (ii) in conformity with the terms of the national joint negotiations signed by the national union representatives on  February , the initial teaching salary was raised by implementing the Compensation Fund, with a further increase in the funds supplied by FONID, and stipulating that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the minimum living wage, irrespective of any agreements reached in the joint negotiation board for education; (iii) the negotiations took place in accordance with all the principles of good faith negotiation. For each proposal made, appropriate efforts were made to reach agreements, within the current economic context and budget of the province; (iv) however, even though the province improved the initial proposal on several occasions, no agreement could be reached. It was here that the increase in the teaching salary was fixed by decree, chiefly safeguarding the right to education and thereby guaranteeing the resumption of classes; and (v) with regard to the classroom allowance, the provincial government considers that the whole complaint is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity. On the contrary, the Government explains that this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism, there has been a substantial improvement in pupil attendance and also a reduction in the number of replacement teachers required. The Government also denies categorically that the classroom allowance is a way for the legislation or Government to penalize the right to strike through substantial losses of teaching salary for just one stoppage or strike day.\n.Lastly, the Government attaches a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza, Second Chamber, in the case Single Union of Education Workers v. Government of Mendoza ?claim of unconstitutionality? dated  December , which calls on the Plenary Court to rule on the constitutionality of the legal provisions challenged in the case file (Decree No. / ratified by Act No.', 'in that the key element of representativeness is disregarded; (iii) there is no right to information on collective bargaining matters since a close examination of the Decree shows that it abolishes the right to information within the joint negotiation board for education itself (section ), thereby denying the unions knowledge of employment levels in the education sector, investment policies, programmes for the introduction of new technologies, etc.; and (iv) there is also no possibility of requesting the Ministry of Labour to set up a board for collective agreement negotiations since section  of Decree No. / has been abolished.\n.Lastly, CTERA denounces the brutal crackdown by the police in the city of Buenos Aires on  April  against education workers and union officials belonging to CTERA, some of whom were unlawfully arrested and subsequently released, for attempting to set up the Mobile School?at the Plaza de los Dos Congresos with a view to calling on the Government, in ways other than work stoppages, to convene a national joint negotiation board in the sector. It also claims that the head of State, when referring to the teachers?salary claims, made offensive comments about the education unions.\n.In a communication dated  April , the Government states that at no time was there non-compliance on its part which would justify the complaint presented by the UDA.

The organizations report that in order to remedy this situation, draft legislation was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies with a view to the establishment of a uniform collective bargaining regime for the judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the  Argentine provinces. They state that it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies and that although the relevant Senate committees issued a favourable opinion on it and it was placed on the Senates agenda on three occasions, it was never considered and, as a consequence, the draft legislation expired pursuant to Act No. .\n.The complainants add that judicial workers do not fall within the scope of Act No. , which regulates the right to bargain collectively in the public sector. They consider that not only does the absence of national legislation guaranteeing the right of employees of the national judiciary to bargain collectively and regulating the exercise of that right affect the interests and working conditions of those employees; it also has an impact on and serves as a deterrent to collective bargaining by judicial workers in all of the provincial jurisdictions since, notwithstanding the countrys federal system, the provinces adopt laws and mechanisms through which they agree to be bound by domestic law. The complainants also allege that the Argentine Government cannot invoke the separation of powers under the national Constitution as grounds for not adopting legislation that would grant judicial workers the right to bargain collectively since, in , the Government introduced and Congress adopted Act No.  regulating the hiring of all public servants and other employees of the judiciary and the national public prosecution services.\n.In a communication sent in , drawing attention to Case No. , in which the Committee on Freedom of Association recommended that the Argentine Government should take measures adapted to national conditions, including legislative measures if necessary, to promote collective bargaining between judiciary authorities and the trade union organizations concerned? and the similar observations of the Committee of Expert on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with regard to the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the complainants add that by failing to adopt legislation on the right of judicial workers to bargain collectively, the Argentine Government has not followed any of the observations and recommendations of the International Labour Organization (ILO) supervisory bodies and that, despite the supervisory bodies?urging, there has been no progress whatsoever on the issue.\n.The complainants further allege that the Argentine Government and the judicial authorities are interfering with the UEJN both at the national level and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. They maintain that: (i) the emergence of the Union of Judicial Workers of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (SITRAJUCABA), a pseudo-union, has led to the unlawful diversion of , members of the UEJN; (ii) Ms Vanesa Raquel Siley, General Secretary of SITRAJUCABA, has links with the political party in power at the time of the events in question; (iii) both at the national level and in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the UEJN has been subjected to threats and persecution by the Attorney-General, MsAlejandra Gil Carbn, and the President of the Council of the Judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Mr Juan Manuel Olmos; (iv) this persecution worsened after  February , when the UEJN held a demonstration in front of the law courts and demanded additional information on the death of a prosecutor, Mr Alberto Nisman, who had been murdered a month earlier; (v) with the collusion of the President of the Council of the Judiciary, the pseudo-union misappropriated information on the UEJNs members and erased the hard drives of the computers in the latters offices; and (vi) the aforementioned events occurred at a time when the countrys then Minister of Labour, Employment and Social Security, Mr Carlos A. Tomada, who had links with the political party, Frente para la Victoria (Onward to Victory), was encouraging the emergence of yellow trade unions? having subjected the unions that did not share the official ideology to years of procedural delays while facilitating the registration process for other unions; in that regard, the complainants state that the Union of Judicial Workers (SITRAJU) and SITRAJUCABA were registered on  April  (Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security decisions Nos / and /), just four days after the registration process began. Lastly, the complainants accuse the Government and the judicial authorities of providing direct and indirect support to SITRAJU and SITRAJUCABA.\n.In its communication of  April , the UEJN alleges, first, that the Council of the Judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CMCABA), hereinafter the local judicial body? arbitrarily excluded it from collective bargaining in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires even though it had signed a compromise agreement, agreeing to bargain collectively with the UEJN, on  December . The complainant maintains that the judicial body excluded it from the collective bargaining process in violation of its trade union rights and, on  November , signed a collective labour agreement with the Association of Employees of the Judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (AEJBA), a trade association that is registered only at the local level, and SITRAJUCABA, against which the complainant states that it has filed several criminal complaints and whose trade union status has been challenged in the courts. The complainant also recalls its allegation that there is no regulation of collective bargaining in any of the geographical areas over which the judiciary has jurisdiction and adds that, to date, there has been no collective bargaining in the sector as required by national legislation. The complainant also reports that the judicial body has conducted de facto?collective bargaining with trade union entities that, under Argentine law, were not authorized to bargain because they did not have the required trade union status (personera gremial).\n.In a subsequent communication, the complainant mentions a meeting between CMCABA, AEJBA and SINTRAJOCABA, which was held on  April  in order to negotiate the wages and working conditions of judicial workers and to make any necessary changes in the current collective agreement. The complainant states that on the date in question, it arrived prepared to negotiate and was denied entry to the premises on the sole pretext that it was not empowered to bargain collectively. Lastly, the complainant maintains that it has exhausted domestic remedies in so far as it has made unsuccessful requests for cancellation of the registration of SITRAJUCABA and of the collective agreement.\n.The UEJN further alleges that the local judicial body has committed acts of trade union interference, giving preferential treatment to SITRAJUCABA and AEJBA. It states that: (i)pursuant to the collective agreement, these two unions were subsidized through contributions from the employer amounting to . per cent of the total wages paid to employees of the judiciary in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires in order to defray the costs of their trade union activities; (ii) the President of the Council of the Judiciary, in decision No. /, ordered the employer to pay a supplement amounting to ,  and  per cent, respectively, of the wages of Mr Jos Alberto Olmos and Mr Adrin Javier Pafunto, (representing SINTRAJU) and Mr Carlos Daniel Daz (representing AEJBA) in order to establish the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Labour Policy and Labour Relations under the collective labour agreement; (iii) the associations that signed the collective labour agreement, but not the complainant, were granted private offices in buildings belonging to the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; and (iv) each of the signatory entities?trade union representatives were granted ten hours of paid trade union leave per month; in an act of discrimination, the UEJN was not granted such leave.\n.In a communication received on  August , the Government indicates that by virtue of the separation of powers in the republican system enshrined in the Constitution, it has forwarded', 'the complainants allegations regarding barriers to collective bargaining in the national judiciary to the Supreme Court. In a second communication dated  March , the Government forwards the Supreme Courts statement that it will not rule on this case. In a communication of May , the Government reiterates that, owing to the countrys republican and federal regime and pursuant to the Constitution, each provincial government may regulate the separation of powers and the competencies of each of those powers in accordance with its own constitution? The Government also mentions sections ,  and  of the federal Constitution, which states that the provinces shall retain all powers not delegated to the Federal Government by this Constitution or expressly reserved by special agreement at the time of their incorporation?and that the provinces are governed by their own local institutions; they elect governors, legislators and other provincial officials without interference from the Federal Government. The Government further states that the country has  provincial states and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and that each of them has been adopting its own legislation for years in light of its specific characteristics and conditions. On this point, the Government refers to the Committee on Freedom of Associations Case No. , in which the Association of Judicial Officers of Mendoza (AFJM) alleged that the Government of Mendoza province had failed to comply with the relevant Convention and the complainant dropped the complaint after signing a sectoral collective agreement with the provincial government. Lastly, the Government maintains that active wage negotiations have resulted in progress in the judiciaries of the various provinces. In its most recent communication (of October ), the Government states that Autarchic Act No. , which regulates the functioning of the judiciary, strengthens the latters independence; it reiterates that wage negotiations with the judiciary are ongoing in many provinces. In that connection, the Government mentions that: (i) there is already collective bargaining with the judiciary in Ro Negro and Santa Cruz provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, all three of which have adopted legislation regulating it; (ii) Santiago del Estero province reports that bargaining with the judiciary is being conducted at a round table with the relevant social stakeholders; and (iii) Neuqun and Crdoba provinces report that they have procedures for voluntary bargaining in the judiciary and that all relevant social stakeholders are notified in such cases.\n.In a communication dated  June , the Government forwards the local judicial bodys response to the UEJNs allegations regarding the negotiation of a collective agreement within the Buenos Aires judiciary and interference in favour of other trade unions. With regard to these allegations, the local judicial body categorically denies having discriminated against the UEJN by excluding it from collective bargaining, failing to follow the recommendations of ILO supervisory bodies, interfering with the exercise of trade union rights, showing favouritism to other trade unions and conducting de facto?collective bargaining with trade union entities that did not have the required trade union status (personera gremial). It states that it is only competent to comment on the situation of the local judiciary since section  of the federal Constitution establishes that the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires shall have a system of autonomous government with its own legislative and judicial powers. It maintains that for this reason, the complainants complaint that judicial workers are unable to bargain collectively at the national level is irrelevant because a collective labour agreement was recently signed at the local level.\n.Concerning the exclusion of the UEJN from collective bargaining, the local judicial body points out that the collective labour agreement was the outcome of joint efforts by itself and the trade unions and that the scope of the agreement includes all workers, regardless of whether they belong to a specific trade union. With respect to the agreement signed on December , the local judicial body explains that it was envisaged that, in addition to the employer, the signatories would be the two most representative trade union entities ?which were, at that time, the UEJN and the AEJBA ?since the statistics provided by the legal secretary in the Department of Human Resources showed that they had  and  members, respectively. However, by the time the collective labour agreement was signed on  November , the UEJN had become less representative than SITRAJUCABA, which had been entered in the Registry of Trade Unions of Workers in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires on  April . Thus, when the collective labour agreement was signed in , the signatories were the AEJBA and SITRAJU, which, again according to data provided by the Department of Human Resources, had , and , members, respectively. The UEJN was excluded from the bargaining because it had  members (. per cent of all trade union members). The local judicial entity also indicates that, according to information contained in Department of Human Resources memorandum No. of  February , the delegates who had represented the UEJN at the signing of the compromise agreement on  December  had changed unions and were members of SINTRAJU when the collective agreement was signed.\n.The local judicial body states that in calling the AEJBA a trade association that is registered only at the local level?and SITRAJUCABA a pseudo-union? the UEJN is attempting to limit the participation of other labour groups, the coexistence of trade unions and the formation of new ones even though the complainant has always functioned locally as a sectional trade union and has not even been registered at the local level. It also states that it was the Committee on Freedom of Association that drew the Governments attention to the elimination of distinctions between trade unions and that, by making such a distinction, the complainant violated the principles established by the Committee. It adds that it has always maintained an ongoing dialogue with all trade union groups, regardless of their registration status.\n.The local judicial body states that the ILO supervisory bodies have always considered that recognition of the most representative trade union does not violate the principles of freedom of association, provided that certain objective requirements are met and that the advantages are limited to the granting of certain preferential rights. It also explains that the fact that the AEJBA, SITRAJUCABA and the UEJN participate at the local level demonstrates respect for the principles of freedom of association and the promotion of trade union pluralism in the judiciary of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. It explains that, given that two of the local judiciarys trade unions are registered only at the local level and that only the complainant has trade union status at the national ?though not the local ?level, priority was given to the most representative unions during the bargaining in question. It states that although section  of the Trade Unions Act (Act No. ) authorizes the withholding of dues from wages only in the case of unions with trade union status, not those that are registered only at the local level, it withholds dues for all three of the trade unions that operate at the local level. Furthermore, although sections  and  of the Act provide that only individuals with trade union status shall enjoy trade union immunity, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires has decided to accord favourable treatment at the local level to all trade union representatives in order to avoid discriminating against any of them.\n.The local judicial body explains that between December  and the date on which the collective labour agreement was signed, for reasons totally unrelated to the agreement, a new trade union entity ?which, in many workers?view, better represented them ?was established. Thus, the local judicial body acted correctly by taking note of the number of members reported by the trade unions in a timely manner and ensuring that workers and their associations enjoyed freedom of association; the fact that it bargained collectively with entities that were registered only at the local level or did not have trade union status does not constitute a violation of the right to freedom of association.\n.As for the contribution made pursuant to an agreement, the local judicial body indicates that this contribution is not a subsidy, but rather an input pursuant to section  of the Trade Unions Act; its purpose is not to defray the costs of trade union activity but, as provided in section  of the collective labour agreement, to fund cultural and social activities and support planned new vocational training that will be available to the entire judicial community, regardless of trade union membership or lack thereof.\n.With regard to the supplements paid to members of the Standing Committee on the Interpretation of Labour Policy and Labour Relations under the collective labour agreement, the local judicial body indicates that the Committees establishment is envisaged in section(i) of the Basic Legal Regime Governing Judges, Public Servants and other Employees of the Judiciary, adopted through Council of Ministers decision No. /, which empowers the Council of the Judiciary to grant specific', 'the complainants allegations regarding barriers to collective bargaining in the national judiciary to the Supreme Court. In a second communication dated  March , the Government forwards the Supreme Courts statement that it will not rule on this case. In a communication of May , the Government reiterates that, owing to the countrys republican and federal regime and pursuant to the Constitution, each provincial government may regulate the separation of powers and the competencies of each of those powers in accordance with its own constitution? The Government also mentions sections ,  and  of the federal Constitution, which states that the provinces shall retain all powers not delegated to the Federal Government by this Constitution or expressly reserved by special agreement at the time of their incorporation?and that the provinces are governed by their own local institutions; they elect governors, legislators and other provincial officials without interference from the Federal Government. The Government further states that the country has  provincial states and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and that each of them has been adopting its own legislation for years in light of its specific characteristics and conditions. On this point, the Government refers to the Committee on Freedom of Associations Case No. , in which the Association of Judicial Officers of Mendoza (AFJM) alleged that the Government of Mendoza province had failed to comply with the relevant Convention and the complainant dropped the complaint after signing a sectoral collective agreement with the provincial government. Lastly, the Government maintains that active wage negotiations have resulted in progress in the judiciaries of the various provinces. In its most recent communication (of October ), the Government states that Autarchic Act No. , which regulates the functioning of the judiciary, strengthens the latters independence; it reiterates that wage negotiations with the judiciary are ongoing in many provinces. In that connection, the Government mentions that: (i) there is already collective bargaining with the judiciary in Ro Negro and Santa Cruz provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, all three of which have adopted legislation regulating it; (ii) Santiago del Estero province reports that bargaining with the judiciary is being conducted at a round table with the relevant social stakeholders; and (iii) Neuqun and Crdoba provinces report that they have procedures for voluntary bargaining in the judiciary and that all relevant social stakeholders are notified in such cases.\n.In a communication dated  June , the Government forwards the local judicial bodys response to the UEJNs allegations regarding the negotiation of a collective agreement within the Buenos Aires judiciary and interference in favour of other trade unions. With regard to these allegations, the local judicial body categorically denies having discriminated against the UEJN by excluding it from collective bargaining, failing to follow the recommendations of ILO supervisory bodies, interfering with the exercise of trade union rights, showing favouritism to other trade unions and conducting de facto?collective bargaining with trade union entities that did not have the required trade union status (personera gremial). It states that it is only competent to comment on the situation of the local judiciary since section  of the federal Constitution establishes that the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires shall have a system of autonomous government with its own legislative and judicial powers. It maintains that for this reason, the complainants complaint that judicial workers are unable to bargain collectively at the national level is irrelevant because a collective labour agreement was recently signed at the local level.\n.Concerning the exclusion of the UEJN from collective bargaining, the local judicial body points out that the collective labour agreement was the outcome of joint efforts by itself and the trade unions and that the scope of the agreement includes all workers, regardless of whether they belong to a specific trade union.

That being the case, it is hoped that this initiative by the new national authorities will lead to a better appreciation of the Committee\'s conclusions and recommendations, in the provinces where the facts occurred; () the police and judiciary authorities have launched an inquiry concerning the alleged attack and looting of the ATE premises in Comodoro Rovadavia, in July ; that inquiry is on hold, pending the discovery of new evidence; () it has been decided to put on hold, for lack of evidence, the inquiry into the assault on Mr. Jorge Villalba (ATE delegate), and to suspend the inquiry into the death threat made against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the administrative committee of ATE-Lans.\n.The Committee takes note of this information. It hopes that the new Government will transmit in the near future all the information requested when this case was last examined in June , so that the pending issues may be fully examined.\n.The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (June )).\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October ,  April and  May .\n.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.When previously examining the case, which dealt with allegations of killing, detention, physical assaults and death threats against trade unionists and trade union leaders, as well as break-ins in trade union premises and trade unionists\' homes and request to withdraw legal recognition, the Committee made the following recommendations (see th Report, para.

The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure protection for the CTA and ATE and for trade unionists who have been threatened.\n.In its communications of  October ,  April and  May , the Government provided the following information in connection with the events which occurred under the jurisdiction of Neuqun Province:-- concerning the complaint that an incendiary bomb was set off in the premises of the Association of State Workers of Cutral-Co, the Government encloses Memorandum No.  (CCO) stating that the police station of the th district of Cutral-Co registered the relevant complaint lodged by Miguel Dante Alvarez and acting upon a telephone call, went on the spot to ascertain that there had been a fire in the ATE premises and, having observed the damage (in this case only ""damage to glass in the entrance door and damage caused by smoke to the premises""), took all the necessary measures to try and clarify the events, such as carrying out an expert\'s appraisal of the premises by competent staff. Any information in this respect will be communicated to the Committee as soon as possible;-- concerning the complaint that ""a group of unidentified persons fired shots at the front of the premises"" of the ATE Cutral-Co headquarters, the Government encloses Memorandum No.  (CCO) stating that Celso Faban Quesada lodged the relevant complaint with the th police station of Cutral-Co specifically pointing out that ""nobody was suspected"". The police took the appropriate measures and initiated preliminary investigations. Any further information on this matter will be communicated to the Committee in the near future;-- the Government points out that, concerning both occurrences, the corresponding judicial proceedings were carried out by the Court of Criminal Investigation and that it was clear that the police authorities had acted promptly and taken the necessary procedures. Similarly, the Government states that the relevant authorities are not sparing any effort to try and cast light immediately on such regrettable occurrences. Any progress made and further information acquired with respect to the events mentioned above will be communicated immediately to the Committee;-- concerning the allegation that on the night of  June  a group of about  police officers had broken into the homes of members of the Central Association of Argentine Workers (CTA) of Cutral-Co, and other allegations (arrest of persons without informing them of where they were being taken, break-ins during the night rather than the day, break-ins by persons wearing hoods, violence used during the break-ins against members of the detainees\' families, lack of jurisdiction of the police to break into the premises, arrest without any legitimate charge being made by the competent legal authority), the Government encloses a copy of Official Note No.  (DSICCO) giving an account of the events and instances which occurred on  June  as a result of the visit of a government group headed by the Vice-Governor of Neuqun Province; copy of Judicial Proceedings No.  (CCO-J); copy of Memorandum No.  (CCO); note drawn up by the head office of the security services of Cutral-Co and officials of the Security', 'Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristan Valle and Angel Lucero and their subsequent arrest was carried out with a warrant, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the situation of the four trade unionists, in particular with respect to the charges brought against them and the length of their detention.\n.As regards the killing of Ms. Teresa Rodrguez by police officers during a demonstration held on  April  in the Neuqun Province, the Committee notes that according to the Government the judicial authorities are still investigating. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.\n.However, the Committee notes that the Government has not provided information on the investigation concerning allegations which remained pending following its last examination of the case: assault on ATE delegate, Jorge Villalba, on  June  in Lans; the death threat against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the administrative committee of ATE-Lans, on  June ; the threat made on  June  against Ms. Ana Mara Luguercho, ATE delegate at the Arturo Melo Hospital; the death threat against the ATE-Lans delegate, Daniel Saavedra; the death threat against Vctor Bordiera, general secretary of ATE-San Martn; the threat against Mr. Ricardo Caffieri, deputy general delegate of ATE-General Rodrguez District, on  July .

In this respect, recalling the importance it attaches to an independent inquiry, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that investigations are carried out on all these allegations and to keep it informed on the outcome of these investigations.\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the charges brought against the members of the CTA of Cutral-Co, Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristan Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristan Valle and Angel Lucero and of the length of their detention.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial investigations as regards the allegations on: () the assault on ATE delegate Mr. Jorge Villalba, on  June  at Lans; () the death threat made against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the administrative committee of ATE-Lans; () the threat against the ATE delegate at the Arturo Melo Hospital, Ms. Ana Mara Luguercho on  June ; () the death threat against the ATE-Lans delegate, Mr. Daniel Saavedra; () the death threat against the general secretary of ATE-San Martn, Mr. Vctor Bordiera; and () the threat against the deputy general delegate of ATE-General Rodrguez district, Mr Ricardo Caffieri.(c) As regards the allegations still pending after the last examination of the case and concerning the attack on the home of the deputy secretary of ATE, National Branch, Mr. Juan Gonzles, the attack and looting in July  of the ATE premises in Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya, and the request by the Governor of Neuqun Province to withdraw legal recognition from the state employees and teaching unions (ATE and ATEN which are affiliated with the CTA), the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to investigate these allegations and to keep it informed of their outcome.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial inquiry into the killing of the worker Teresa Rodrguez by police offices during a demonstration organized on  April  in Neuqun Province in protest against unemployment.\n.The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) dated  August . Subsequently, in a communication dated  October , the Central Association of Argentine Workers (CTA) supported the complaint and presented new allegations.\n.The Government sent its partial observations in a communications dated  February and  May .\n.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  August , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) states that the worrying rise in the unemployment rate has resulted in greater levels of social unrest in Argentina, and that in order to honour its commitments and obligations to the workers, trade union leaders have augmented the number of measures protesting against the national authorities which in turn, in spite of the international Conventions signed by Argentina, have led to a disturbing increase in acts of anti-union discrimination. Specifically, the CLAT alleges that in a number of provinces and regions, the following acts of violence have been committed:-- Neuqun Province. In this region, which has been affected by very high levels of unemployment following the privatization of the National Oil Company (YPF) and the associated lay-offs, a number of trade union leaders affiliated to the Central Association of Argentine Workers (CTA) have been the victims of acts which directly violate the right to freedom of association. Specifically, during a demonstration organized on  April  by workers in the region to protest against unemployment and the anti-social policies implemented by the Government, Ms. Teresa Rodrguez was shot to death. All the sources consulted state that she was killed by a shot fired by a police officer during the mass police action against the demonstrators. Following the death, the Association of State Workers (ATE) set up a human rights commission in its premises to monitor the investigation into the killing. On  March , these premises were the target of an attack, and on the th of the same month, a group of unidentified persons fired shots at the front of the premises. On the night of  June , a group of about  police officers broke into the homes of the following members of the Central Association of Argentine Workers (CTA) of Cutral-Co: Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristin Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristin Valle and Angel Lucero. The trade unionists were taken from their homes without being informed of where they were being taken. The unlawful nature of the detentions is aggravated by the fact that, according to the testimony of various members of the detainees\' families, some of the police officers involved in the operation wore hoods, struck children and old people, and used a disproportionate degree of force. According to confirmed reports, the officers were not from the Cutral-Co police department and had no jurisdiction in that city. The detainees were held at different times in different unknown locations. Subsequently, one police department claimed to be holding them in detention but declined to let anyone see them. After about  hours, following intense protests, the district criminal court judge proceeded to clarify the legal situation of the detainees and charged three of them (Cristin Rodrguez, Sandro Botron and Beatriz Parra) with committing an offence contrary to article bis of the Penal Code which provides for the punishment of members of a legitimate association which commits unlawful acts. The charge was based solely on the ""evidence"" of statements made by a number of police officials who accused the trade unionists of having participated in protest demonstrations and obstructed roads in the district, to demand the implementation of the agreement signed by the Government giving work to unemployed people in the area. The gravity of this illegal act is also underlined by the fact that only one legitimate charge was brought against three of the detainees. Another irregularity in legal terms was the fact that the detainees were conditionally released after being warned not to participate in any march or demonstration during the following days. This is particularly significant, bearing in mind the fact that a protest march had been due to take place  hours later in protest against the failure of the Government to keep its promises to provide jobs for the unemployed.-- Buenos Aires Province -- Lans. From  June  onwards there was a series of physical attacks and threats against delegates and workers of the Lans section of the Association of State Workers (ATE): () on  June at approximately  o\'clock as he was leaving his place of work (the Evita Hospital in Lans), the ATE delegate in that establishment, Mr. Jorge Villalba, was stopped by three individuals, one of whom wore a balaclava while the other two also concealed their faces. They proceeded to abuse him verbally for his trade union activities and shot him in the', 'left hand. Mr. Villalba had to undergo surgery, the results of which are still not known. The incident was reported to the first police precinct of Lans; () on  June  at approximately  a.m., the mother of Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the Administrative Committee of ATE-Lans employed in the laboratory department of the Evita Hospital, received by telephone a death threat against her daughter. The incident was reported to Criminal Court No.  of the district of Lomas de Zamora; () on  June  at about . a.m., Ms. Ana Mara Luguercho, an ATE delegate employed at the Arturo Melo Hospital, was stopped a few yards from her home by two men in a car of unknown make who detained and threatened her; () the ATE-Lans delegate, Mr. Daniel Saavedra, received a death threat by telephone at his home; the caller appeared to know all the members of his family and details of his allegations. The incident was reported to the criminal court of the Lomas de Zamora Judicial Department.-- Buenos Aires Province -- San Martn. The General Secretary of the ATE-San Martn, Mr. Vctor Bordiera, received an anonymous death threat by telephone at his home. The San Martn regional unit of the Buenos Aires Province police took note of the report of the incident and in turn reported it to the criminal court of the San Martn Judicial Department.-- Buenos Aires Province -- General Rodrguez district. On  July , an unsigned letter was received at the home of Mr. Ricardo Caffieri, containing threats against the Deputy General Delegate of ATE for General Rodrguez district. That night and the following day, he received similar threats by telephone at his home. The incident was reported by the General Secretary to the local police station, which immediately reported the matter to the district judge.-- Attack on the home of the Deputy Secretary of the ATE (National-Federal Capital). At dawn on Saturday,  June , the home of the Deputy Secretary of the ATE (National Branch), Mr. Juan Gonzlez, came under attack. The attackers broke down the front door of the premises, which were not occupied by Mr. Gonzlez at the time. The nature of the attack was evidenced by the fact that the attackers did not remove anything of value or indeed anything else from the premises. The operational capabilities of the attackers was illustrated by the fact that Mr. Gonzlez lives right in the centre of the capital, only a block away from the district police station and close to the National Congress, in an area which enjoys a high level of police protection.-- Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya districts. At dawn on  July , unknown persons attacked the premises of the ATE (Comodoro Rivadavia section). The premises were looted. At the time of the attack, a police patrol was located less than  metres away but claims to have seen no suspicious activity, although the attackers removed all the furniture, computers and the fax machine from the premises. The premises of the Goya section of the ATE were also looted. In that incident, only minor articles were removed, fixtures were destroyed and graffiti drawn on the walls. Both cases are being investigated by the criminal courts of Comodoro Rivadavia and Goya districts.\n.In its communication dated  October , the Central Association of Argentine Workers (CTA) alleges that the attacks against the freedom of association of the CTA and its members in Neuqun Province have intensified and that the Governor of the province has requested the withdrawal of legal recognition from the state employees\' and teaching unions (ATE and ATEN) which were affiliated to the CTA. The complainants maintain that the request is clearly an attempt to retaliate against the trade unions for the protests and stoppages agreed by them following a government decision to cut wages by  per cent. The complainants explain that during these legitimate union activities, which were conducted in accordance with all the relevant legal provisions, there were isolated disturbances caused by trouble-making elements that had nothing to do with the organizations concerned.\n.In its communications of  February and  May , the Government states that, with regard to the killing of Ms. Teresa Rodrguez in Neuqun Province, an inquiry has been instituted by the Criminal Investigation Court of Cutral-Co, and that this investigation is at the preliminary stage of gathering evidence with a view to identifying the person or persons responsible for the killing and that police officer Hugo Alberto Rudolf has been indicted. Evidence from witnesses, ballistic evidence and evidence obtained from visual inspection of the scene have been obtained and the defence is presently appealing the indictment. Any new developments in the matter will be communicated immediately to the Committee.\n.The Government states that, with regard to the incidents reported to have taken place within the jurisdiction of Buenos Aires Province -- Lans, Lujan and General San Martin -- information has been requested from the Under Secretariat of Labour of Buenos Aires Province (the competent body for labour matters within the province). According to that body, no complaints have been received from the victims or from any trade union. Nevertheless, the appropriate inquiries are being carried out with the police of Buenos Aires Province and any information will be communicated to the Committee as quickly as possible. Finally, the Government states that, as concerns the incidents taking place in the provinces of Santa Cruz and Neuqun, it is awaiting the information requested from the respective governments. As concerns Ana Mara Luguercho, the proceedings currently under way in Lans are not related to the allegations.\n.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainants allege the killing of a worker during a protest demonstration, the detention of trade unionists and break-ins at their homes, physical assaults and death threats against trade unionists, attacks on trade union headquarters and premises and on trade unionists\' homes, and the request to withdraw legal recognition of a trade union in retaliation for demonstrations and stoppages.\n.Firstly, the Committee notes with concern the gravity of all the allegations presented and regrets that the Government has only provided partial information.\n.With regard to the allegation concerning the killing of the worker Ms. Teresa Rodrguez by police officers during a demonstration organized on  April  in Neuqun Province in protest against unemployment, the Committee notes that the Government states that it has initiated judicial proceedings, a police official has been indicted in this matter and the indictment is being appealed.\n.The Committee deeply deplores the killing of Ms. Teresa Rodrguez and cannot refrain from noting that the Government confirms the involvement of the police in the incidents in which the worker concerned died. Under these circumstances, the Committee hopes that the judicial proceedings will clarify the incidents, apportion responsibility and impose sanctions on the person or persons responsible, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.\n.The Committee also recalls that in June  it examined allegations of acts of violence against trade unionists who had participated in a protest demonstration in which a worker had also died. On that occasion, the Committee recalled that ""the authorities should resort to the use of force only in situations where law and order is seriously threatened. The intervention of the forces of law and order should be in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence when controlling demonstrations which might result in a disturbance of the peace"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee requested the Government ""to instruct the police authorities in future to guarantee the exercise of the right of trade unions to demonstrate without being the object of disproportionate measures or excessive violence"" (see th Report, Case No. , para. ). The Committee requests the Government in future to ensure that these principles are respected.\n.The Committee notes that the other allegations presented in this case refer specifically to: () the attacks that took place on  and  May  on the union premises of ATE in which a human rights commission had been set up to monitor the investigation into the killing of Ms. Teresa Rodrguez; () the break-ins into unionists\' homes and subsequent detention on  June  of members of the Cutral-Co branch of the CTA (Sandro Botron, Juan Bastas, Cristin Rodrguez, Oscar Chvez, Beatriz Parra, Cristin Valle and Angel Lucero) and the legal proceedings initiated against three of them (Rodrguez, Botrol and Parra); () the assault on ATE delegate Jorge Villalba, who was wounded in the left hand by a gunshot on  June  in Lans (the incident was reported to the Lans police); () the death threat against Ms. Nlida Curto, a member of the Administrative Committee of']"

The enterprise instigated criminal and civil actions against them, falsely accusing them of responsibility for bomb scares, sabotage at enterprise facilities and disturbances, etc., and set the press and media against them. The enterprise also dismissed staff delegates without taking the step of calling upon the courts to lift their trade union protection, as required by the legislation.\n.The CTA adds that Alitalia S.A. refused to grant trade union privileges to the trade union leader, Mr. Hugo Perosa, and completely changed his assignment, resulting in a deprivation of work responsibilities. Afterward, when Mr. Perosa became a member of the CTA executive, the enterprise dismissed him (on  October ), claiming ""neglect of duties"" as the cause, and without calling upon the courts to lift his trade union protection, as required by the legislation. (In a communication of  December  sent to the Office, the CTA states that Federal Labour Chamber  had handed down a ruling on  November  ordering the enterprise to reinstate Mr. Hugo Perosa in his post.)\n.The CTA further alleges that the Nestl S.A. enterprise dismissed the trade union leader Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn without requesting that his trade union protection be lifted.\n.In its communication of  February  the CTA alleges that the provincial government of Salta and certain municipalities of the province refused to apply Act No.  on trade unions, and specifically its provisions protecting the job security of trade union leaders who are public servants. This applied in particular to those who opposed privatization, as was the case of leaders of the State Workers\' Association (ATE). The CTA refers to  leaders who were dismissed or transferred without the required judicial procedure being initiated to lift their trade union protection, and who were the subject of proceedings between  and  which have still not been concluded, including the following leaders from the province of Salta and some of whom were from the municipality of General Gemes: Carlos Alberto Ibarra, Miguel Angel Ravaza, Hugo Miguel Quispe, Rubn Antonio Saravia, Juana Isnardez de Ruiz, Reynaldo Eduardo Pistan, Ramona Escobar de Gutirrez, Juan Carlos Valdez, Cristina Crdoba Ruiz de Mosa, Miguel Angel Vittor, Laura Alicia Lpez, Samuel Osvaldo Polo, Elio Fernndez Rodrguez, Ricardo Armiana Dohorman, Ral Avellaneda, Ren Francisco Elejalde, Hctor Luis Cruz and Luis Roberto Ramos.\n.In its communication of  June , the CTA alleges that on  May  the registration of the Federation of Energy Workers of the Argentine Republic (FETERA) was revoked through administrative channels in violation of the legislation and of Convention No. . The revocation was based on the Federation\'s failure to comply with the requirements for constituent organizations, which are not set out by the legislation. It further alleges the persecution by the authorities of the province of Santiago del Estero of the State Workers\' Association (ATE), as criminal charges were reportedly brought against its trade union leaders and its members\' contributions were unjustly retained.\n.In more general terms, the CTA notes that there is discrimination against trade union organizations which are ""merely registered"" (simplemente inscriptas) as opposed to those which are registered with ""official trade union status"" (personera gremial) with regard to protection against abuse and persecution by employers and the authorities. Specifically, sections  and  of Act No.  on trade unions reserve for representatives of trade union associations with ""official trade union status"" the legal and procedural guarantees of protection against dismissal or modification of their work situation. Similarly, from the complaint it can be understood that there is some doubt regarding judicial rulings on the applicability of these provisions to public servants and employees.\n.In its communications of ,  and  October ,  May and  October  and  January , the Government states that with regard to the complaint made against the Atlantic Energy Distribution Enterprise S.A. (EDEA S.A.) for allegedly committing anti-trade union acts, the Mar del Plata Lighting and Power Workers\' Union correctly requested the intervention of the local administrative authorities. Consequently, the Ministry of Labour intervened by issuing Decision No. /, which ordered that two trade union leaders be reinstated immediately and left the suspension of another without effect. The Ministry refrained from any further intervention pending a definitive ruling by the competent judicial authority. The Ministry\'s decision was appealed by EDEA S.A., thus prompting the Ministry of Labour to issue Decision No. /. In it, following an extensive examination of the de jure and de facto circumstances surrounding the previous decision, the Ministry rejected the appeal against Decision No. / and confirmed it in its entirety. An agreement was signed on  October  between EDEA S.A. and the Argentine Federation of Lighting and Power Workers (FATLYF), and was ratified by the administrative labour authority. In it: both parties expressed their interest in resolving and overcoming the conflicts which gave rise to sanctions, suspensions and other measures adopted by the enterprise; EDEA S.A. undertook to make null and void the disciplinary suspensions applied to its staff who took part in the work stoppages on ,  and  July , to pay the appropriate compensation to the dismissed staff, to transfer some of the staff and to reinstate the rest in the enterprise; EDEA S.A. further undertook to abstain from pursuing all pending judicial proceedings against the Mar del Plata Lighting and Power Workers\' Union and against the members of its executive, including Mr. Rigane; and EDEA S.A. undertook to drop the criminal charges it had brought following the incidents on  July . Clearly, it appears that the effective conciliation efforts of the competent authorities in the government of the province of Buenos Aires made it possible to overcome this conflict and to reaffirm the protection and guarantee of freedom of association.\n.As regards the allegations concerning the incidents in the province of Salta, the Government states that the situations of Mr. Luis Alberto Ramos, Mr. Vctor Angel Ravaza and Ms. Cristina Crdoba Ruiz have been resolved. Mr. Osvaldo Polo, Mr. Ral Vicente Avellaneda, Ms. Laura Alicia Lpez de Cabral, Mr. Ren Francisco Elejalde and Mr. Elio Fernndez Rodrguez, who were employed by what was then known as the Bank of the Province of Salta, have come to an agreement with the bank and have halted any action taken against it. As regards the other individual cases, since they were not within the direct competence of the provincial executive, it was not possible to provide any information beyond that which had been submitted. The national Ministry of Labour had directly requested the appropriate bodies and institutions (the municipality of General Gemes, the Senate of the province of Salta and the Bank of the Province of Salta, S.A.) to report on the situation to which the complainant referred.\n.As regards the dismissal of the Alitalia S.A. trade union leader, Mr. Hugo Perosa, the Government states that no request for intervention has been submitted to the authorities, and that no judicial case has been brought. Nonetheless, from the inquiries which have been carried out there is no indication that the conflict was continuing. Under the legislation, questions relating to trade union immunity do not fall within the competence of the executive branch, and must be resolved through the labour courts.\n.As regards the dismissal by the Nestl S.A. enterprise of the trade union leader Mr. Marcelo Fabin Martn, the Government states that the CTA and the trade union leader in question have undertaken a summary reinstatement procedure against the enterprise, as provided in section  of Act No. , and that it is currently before the National First Instance Judge, ""Third Nomination"" (Tercera Nominacion) (Civil and Commercial) of the City of Villa Mara in the province of Crdoba. In principle, the protective measure requested by the complainant reinstating Mr. Martn has already been taken. The Government includes copies of the lawsuit and the judicial decision. The judicial file on the incidents has been in the possession of the trade union leader\'s lawyer since June , and has thus far not been returned to the judge. Despite the lack of action taken by the interested party, the judge has been asked to request that the file be returned so as to clarify the stage of the proceedings and determine whether any damages occurred which would justify intervention by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security pursuant to the protection provided under Conventions Nos.  and .\n.As regards the allegations concerning the Federation of Energy Workers of the Argentine Republic (FETERA), the case is before the courts, as the Federation has invoked the provisions of section  of Act No.  on trade unions, which establishes the exclusive competence of the National Labour Appeals Chamber for such questions, a legislative policy that is, moreover, in conformity with the principles of freedom of association. The Chamber recently ruled that judicial Decision No. / was to be revoked, and ordered that the FETERA must be registered in the Registry of Trade Union Associations (the', 'weightings that dated from the  Household Expenditure Survey (ENGH), and informant sources were based on sales volumes defined in the  National Economic Census. INDEC sends examples of problems of measurement that occurred previously.\n.INDEC indicates that having found irregularities, and following instructions from the highest national authority, the matter was reported by Beatriz Paglieri to the Notary General of the Government, through his representative at INDEC headquarters, who drew up the report on the basis of which the notary advised that there was evidence?of errors in the report submitted by Marcela Almeida and Emilio Platzer. This unprecedented matter generated a marked animosity towards the official in certain management circles, as it was the first time that a flagrant misrepresentation had been documented. It is worth emphasizing that out of some  employees who make up the staff of the CPI management, only  were determined to harass and/or boycott the new management. It is very important to emphasize the excellent predisposition presented by the great majority who made up and continue to make up the CPI team which allowed the CPI to be produced on time and in due form. It is no surprise that some of the complaints come from persons who made the mistakes?reported to the Notary General.\n.INDEC states, in the course of extensive technical explanations, that many of those responsible for the institutional errors in the production of data up to  went on to form the internal council of ATEINDEC, which provided them with protection in situations when they should have been subject to summary administrative proceedings under the legislation applicable to the national public administration. This defensive conduct was concomitant with all kinds of statements in the media designed to seriously undermine the prestige of the institution, and to generate confusion among the public.\n.According to INDEC, this behaviour was aggravated by a different type of disorder generated both within and outside the Institute, including travel within and outside the country, all aimed at achieving a public position contrary to the official statistics. Worth mentioning in this regard is the false information concerning the reassignment of duties which were never held. Such is the case of Ms Cynthia Pok, self-styled Director of the EPH when there was only an internal arrangement, a rule of the Institute of little legal import, which put her in sole charge of the office of that department. To be in charge of an office involves administering permits relating to staff (absences, holidays, etc.) and responsibility only for work related to office procedures. This function excludes the technical management of a department. The Director of this survey was MsClyde Trabucchi, who was actually appointed to the post in an open competition in , an appointment which expired in  and was extended without competition. She was never insolvent or appointed by presidential order as national director for living standards. As in the previous case, she was put in charge of the office of that national department. It is evident that the CTA and Ms Cynthia Pok herself are falsely purporting that she holds public office, a criminal offence under national legislation. In the same vein, cases can be mentioned such as that of Mr Luciano Belforte, who was never head of CPI data collection since there is no such post, or Ms Marcela Almeida, who is said to have been removed from the coordination of the National Consumer Price Index section, a post which does not exist. Moreover, Ms Almeida is not even an INDEC staff member. On the contrary, she was and is contracted by the Government of Buenos Aires City, under a cooperation agreement.\n.INDEC indicates that Ms Paglieri was the victim of an assault by Mr Emilio Platzer on October . When she was in the INDEC building and guarded by two federal police officers, Ms Paglieri was violently pushed by Mr Platzer. It led to the sending of a note to the INDEC management by the Ministry of the Interior, requesting consideration be given to the possibility of imposing a sanction. Finally, and following an instruction on the matter by the Legal Affairs Department, the management decided not to renew his contract with the institution, on the grounds of his failure to observe the standards expected of those who work in the national public administration. INDEC considers that it is particularly relevant to mention these facts and dispositions with respect to the characterization of the conduct of certain members of the ATEINDEC union who, like Mr Platzer, had no hesitation in resorting to aggression as a result of their animosity against INDEC staff, which had nothing to do with trade union actions. It is important to emphasize that MrPlatzer was no longer working in the CPI Department because he made unacceptable mistakes.\n.INDEC indicates in relation to the alleged replacement of professional technical staff by persons related to the political authorities that primarily, as stated above, the INDEC authorities were appointed by the executive authority under the legislation applicable in the Republic of Argentina.\n.INDEC indicates that the theory that the CTA expresses in its statement and on which it bases an account concerning the unlawfulness of the presence and work of certain?INDEC staff is incorrect and tendentious. It is incorrect in that it would be nonsense to think that the supposed intervention?occurred through, for example, the appointment of a new director for the CPI. The reason for the erroneous character is simple: as in any organization, private or public enterprise, there are changes of post which do not reflect any type of intervention? but a renewal of personnel in the hierarchy involving a systematic reorganization. This is a far cry from the supposed destruction?conjectured by the complainant. It is tendentious because it affirms what it seeks to prove, namely, that INDEC is in a state of exception and instability, which the Government was exploiting. The action of the Association of State Workers, ATEINDEC, accompanied by the homogeneous statements of the media companies, was the only indication, a false one, of a supposed state of exception which, bluntly, does not exist. In fact, these assertions show the desire of the trade union or its representatives to project their influence into matters which are beyond their competence. The Argentine legal system does not contain a constitutional or legal right of an individual, trade union or prospective worker which grants them powers of control of any type over the appointment of the officials whose legitimate presence they are challenging.\n.As regards the alleged physical violence against the workers on  August , INDEC indicates that in a biased and false description of the facts, the complainant states: during the  day strike by INDEC workers in protest against the situation generated by the management? In this respect, we must inform you that INDEC has a total of ,workers. Of those, during August , according to the attendance sheets provided by the Human Resources Department,  workers took part in the strike, representing per cent of the total workforce. In addition, only one took part in the strike for ten days, one for eight days, one for five days, six for three days,  for two days and  for only one day. It thus clearly emerges that the complainant is not telling the truth when it states that there was a strike of  days. It is also lying when it speaks in general terms of the INDEC workers? as  per cent of the workers never took part in the strike in the period mentioned in its complaint, and of the  workers who joined the strike,  did so for only one day, as mentioned, thus it may be wondered whether this group can be adjudged representative of INDEC workers in general. Furthermore, the total number of ATEINDEC members is  out of a total of , workers.\n.The complainant also infers the occurrence of a violent?intervention by the Argentine Federal Police (PFA) preventing the erection of a stand at the entrance to the INDEC building. On this point, by way of preliminary explanation, it should be noted that certain spaces in the Federal Capital are under the jurisdiction of the PFA and that INDEC has no control over the conduct of the PFA or any hierarchical link with it, for obvious reasons of competence. With respect to the facts, we can report that on that date, various persons were observed provoking the security forces, preventing access to the building and causing damage. Of the rough handling? there is no real, judicial or administrative evidence whatsoever.\n.As regards the existence of three court cases, Nos /, I-- and , all for various injuries, in which the deputy secretary of ATE-Capital, Luis Opromolla, two workers of other areas of the Ministry of Economy (not identified) and Ms Cynthia Pok, all members of ATEINDEC, were injured, it should be mentioned in relation to the first two cases that these were a single case, namely, No. . The proceedings in question were initiated on the basis', 'impact that such reports could have on public opinion, initiated an aggressive policy of intervention in the Institute. Thus it ordered the replacement of professional technical staff by persons in sympathy with the political authorities who, controversially, made certain changes to the methodology and substituted survey data which resulted in data more in line with the public pronouncements of members of the Government. This was denounced by the workers and public opinion in general quickly noted the clumsy attempts at deception.\n.The CTA adds that although it was in January  that the national Government ordered intervention in the INDEC, prior to that the situation was already not normal due to the fact that the then Director was pressured to disclose the names of the businesses surveyed (that being information protected by statistical confidentiality). The CTA alleges that from January , the disembarkation?began with the permanent and direct presence of the interveners and the persons reporting to them. From that time onwards, the result was manipulation of public statistics, harassment of workers and systematic destruction of the institution which has continued until this day. The intervention consisted basically of abolishing the Institutes chief function, which is to produce reliable and accessible statistics produced in a transparent manner in the framework of legal and methodological rules. The first operation subject to intervention was the Consumer Price Index (CPI). On  January , a new Director of the Institute was appointed by presidential decree.\n.According to the CTA, the Secretary of Trade and the Director of INDEC said that the body needed to adapt to the policy set by the Government in accordance with its own needs. Thus, from that moment, data would not be published in order to align public policies with reality and the needs demonstrated by the information, but, on the contrary, the Institute would be turned into a political tool of the Government. This situation produced an immediate reaction from everyone, public opinion and the Institutes workers. That is how the collective dispute to save INDEC began. The CTA adds that, in consequence, and because the active opposition of the Institutes workers to the manipulation and deception promoted through the Institute constituted a serious obstacle, the Government launched an offensive against the workers and their representatives which took numerous forms. They began to harry and punish the Institutes workers through dismissals, reassignments, wage reductions, summary proceedings, discriminatory acts, actions in the courts and other forms of harassment, even to the extent of allowing or encouraging physical violence by third parties in INDECs sphere of operations.\n.The CTA alleges the following violations of the right to organize.Physical violence against workers\n.The CTA indicates that on  August , during the  day strike by INDEC workers in protest against the situation generated by the intervention and rejecting the reassignment of the Director of the Permanent Household Survey, the workers?assembly decided to erect a stand at the entrance to the INDEC building, as a trade union action to make society aware of the need to defend public statistics and the workers who opposed the manipulation. The violent intervention by the Federal Police of Argentina (PFA) prevented the stand being erected, and it was confiscated to prevent any possibility of erecting it. The workers were subjected to rough handling.\n.The CTA adds that on  May , when a meeting of all the workers employed in the Ministry of Economy was called in the central hall of the Ministry, to present to the Minister , signatures in support of a claim for a wage increase of  pesos (ARS) through the reception desk, those present were brutally beaten by persons recognized to be members of a shock force which usually operated in INDEC. As a result of the attack, the assistant secretary of ATE-Capital, Luis Opromolla, was beaten and suffered various injuries, and two other workers from other parts of the Ministry were left bleeding and the worker, Cynthia Pok, was pushed violently to the ground. These attacks took place in the deliberate absence of the security personnel who normally work in the area and just after all the lights that usually illuminate the area went out. The complaints of threats and injuries are the subject of proceedings in Case No. /, instructing prosecutors office, office ; I--, instructing prosecutors office  and , correctional prosecutors office .Anti-trade union discrimination ?Persecution through judicial means\n.The CTA indicates that there have now been numerous court cases in the dispute that has arisen in INDEC. Two of them are against delegates and workers who were prosecuted by the Institute for taking part in the dispute. These cases are: (a) Luciano Osvaldo Belforte, defrauding the public administration? Case No. /, Federal , office . This case concerns trade union delegates, Mr Belforte and Ms Graciela Bevacqua. The persecution by INDEC intervention was pursued in the criminal courts. In this case, INDEC intervention involved filing a complaint against these workers, alleging that they had committed fraud against the Institute. The charge was that the workers had fraudulently claimed holiday and overtime pay. The judge in the criminal court of first instance tried MrLuciano Belforte, ATEINDEC delegate, on the basis of a construction totally alien to the principles of criminal procedural law. On appeal by the accused, the National Criminal Appeal Court quashed the proceedings and upheld the workers, and also reprimanded the judge in the lower court which had accepted the allegations by the INDEC intervention. The Appeal Court quashed the proceeding. The Court emphasized that trial without evidence is a clear example of persecution; (b) Liliana Haydee Gasco v. State, Ministry of Economy and Production, summary proceeding, Case No. /. In September , INDEC intervention ordered that trade union delegate Liliana Gasco should not be given a desk, computer and telephone at the CPI office. This situation lasted for several months until, as a consequence of legal actions, Ms Gasco was assigned other tasks which were not appropriate to her function as special operations supervisor. The changes in the conditions of work imposed by the employer are expressly prohibited in the case of a trade union delegate or representative (article  of the Trade Unions Act, No. ). The safeguards for trade union activities set out in the Act were the legal arguments recognized in the judgments in favour of the trade union delegate, both in the lower court, Court No. , and the appeal court, Chamber III of the National Labour Court. The Court found that the reinstatement decided in the lower court should be implemented on the same conditions, in the same category and functions as those normally exercised by Ms Liliana Haydee Gasco prior to the change decided by her employer; (c) Vanina Micello v. State, Ministry of Economy and Production, National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC), Action for Amparo (protection), Case No. /. Here the presiding judge, Dr Gabriela Vzquez, supported by Judge Dr Luis Catardo in a majority judgment, stated that: On the basis of the material and evidence produced in the documents, I consider that it is proved that INDEC, through its officials, order the reassignment and change of work of staff member Vanina Micello as a reprisal for her exercise of trade union activities. I reach this conclusion, starting from a series of precise and consistent indications that show negative discrimination and, in addition, that the defendant did not show, regarding the burden of proof, that the reassignment was objectively and reasonably justified. In this context, the decision taken by the defendant to reassign Vanina Micello should be declared null and void and it is ordered that she be reinstated in the function that she performed prior to her reassignment.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:\n.The CTA also refers to the court case of Luciano Osvaldo Belforte, violation of domicile? Case No. , Criminal and Correctional Court No. , office . The employer issued an internal memorandum prohibiting the entry of delegate Belforte to the workplace. Apart from the fact that this legal measure was appealed in the labour courts, the delegate could enter the building as that was the location of the trade union office and he is a member of the internal council. On these grounds, the employer initiated criminal proceedings for violation of domicile? The case is still in process.Attacks on trade union premises\n.The CTA alleges that on  May , the ATE trade union office on the tenth floor of the INDEC main building was attacked. The intruders overturned and scattered fittings, computers, furniture and documents. On  July , another even more violent attack occurred, as the intruders attacked and damaged the trade union office (the case is being heard as Case No. /, contraventional prosecutors office ).Intimidation through police and para-police presence\n.The CTA indicates that in February , under the pretext peddled by the Institute intervention that it was a matter of security personnel acting as bodyguards to the new Director of the CPI section, the permanent presence of surveillance personnel was observed on the third floor of the building at']"

Faced with the exhaustion of the negotiations to resolve the dispute and faced with the immovable, unreasonable and recalcitrant attitude adopted by the State of the Province of Entre Ros with regard to fulfilling its obligations, the industrial action decided by the trade unions took place.\n.The complainant organization states that in the face of this industrial action, which obviously had massive support from the teachers, the provincial authorities?only reply was to issue regulations to allow deductions for strike days. By doing so, they attacked the teaching profession in the province with provisions which clearly conflicted with the constitutional guarantee. This being the case, the deduction ordered by the State, apart from a dogmatic assertion lacking in any justification, constitutes penalization?in violation of a right which should be strongly guaranteed. The complainant indicates that, for that reason, it is addressing this complaint to the Committee, on constitutional and supranational grounds, concerning the statement in the preamble of the resolution of the General Education Council that If it is not performed (it refers to performance of work), remuneration should not be paid for the time when the services ceased to be provided and in proportion to the length of time when the labour was withdrawn.?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:\n.The complainant organization considers that penalization for individual participation in the industrial action which was collectively decided is illegal, as the background and justification of the trade union action is the prior failure of the provincial state to comply with the constitutional requirement to revise wages in line with the cost of living, set out in the Constitution of  and in the current revised text. It should be emphasized that the principle of legality must preside over all acts of government and constitute the basic guarantee for the foundation of a democratic state and rule of law. The deductions made are an administrative sanction and, thus, an expression of the States power of sanction and punishment, which affects the right to strike, and thus has clear constitutional implications.\n.The complainant organization indicates that there is a procedure in Argentina instituted by a current National Law (Act No. ) to resolve collective disputes which cannot be resolved between the parties, and this procedure was not followed by the provincial administration, which makes its action illegal. The Provincial State commits, as a matter of practice?an act which consists of making deductions from wages for days when teachers took strike action, without ensuring due process and without resorting to the appropriate bodies to determine the reasons behind the industrial action.\n.The complainant organization states that bad industrial practice by the Entre Ros provincial state and the General Education Council is common. They have repeatedly abused of collective bargaining (Act No.  on Collective Bargaining for Teachers) seeking only to stop the strike action. According to the complainant, this is shown by the fact that they come to the table without genuine wage offers and, when rare and inadequate wage rises are granted, they are not consolidated as pensionable or the basis for future increases, and have no impact on teachers?benefits (concealed sums which merely diminish teaching wages, made up of various concealed items which are not subject to tax or contributions). Neither did they respond to claims for decent conditions of work, which is shown by the calamitous state of school buildings, and the lack of rooms for school canteens and washrooms.\n.The administrative action in this case was illegal because it not only proceeded without respecting the right to defence or due process, but when it issued Resolution No.  on the deductions, the State had not requested compulsory conciliation through the General Education Council, nor had the trade unions been given legal notice to cease their industrial action. Thus, the administrative acts which are claimed to serve as the legal basis for the deductions are null and void because they are unjustified and lack foundation. According to the complainant, the deduction is compulsive, arbitrary, and unreasonable, and is shown in pay statement as Deduction for days not worked? without there having been a prior declaration of the illegality of the declared strike, without ordering compulsory conciliation and without giving notice to the trade unions to cease their industrial action. In short, without waiting for the judicial pronouncement and subjugating the guarantees of the teachers, who were victims of the illegal act. Not only this, but the deduction was applied as an administrative sanction?without any basis in any constitutional rule of the administrative power. The second part of article  of National ActNo. , which institutes an administrative proceeding prior to any action, is conclusive when it states: the strike or voluntary and premeditated reduction in production, below normal limits, shall result for workers in the loss of the entitlement to remuneration for the period of the strike or reduction in work if they do not cease after receiving notice from the competent authority?\n.The complainant organization emphasizes that the notice to the striking workers to return to their work is the means of excluding the guarantee of the right to strike. If the judicial or administrative authority does not give this notice, it is not possible to enforce a sanction such as deduction of pay, as in that case, the administrative action violates the principle of reasonableness and fundamentally violates the principle of the hierarchy of law in article of the National Constitution. The complainant also considers that both the Provincial Government and the General Education Council violated their own rules, as they resorted to the courts to stop the strike and, before the court decision, issued administrative rulings under which they claim to legitimize the arbitrary deductions. The lack of a legal provision which legitimizes the deductions for strike days emerges clearly from the very text of Directive No.  of  of the Executive Power of the Province, an administrative act of lower rank which can in no way justify the states action. Indeed, the purpose of that act is to issue instructions on deductions of pay for the adoption of industrial action by employees of the provincial public administration? without these instructions?being in any way supported by a basic legal instrument. For that reason, the complainant organization considers that the directive is purely arbitrary, a caprice of the executive power, tainted with arbitrariness, and should be condemned.\n.The claimant states that the provincial state of Entre Ros and the General Education Council are not only violating the guarantee of the right to strike by deducting days without following due legal process, but are also in contravention of the international human rights treaties ratified by the Argentine State, ignoring and subjugating their obligations which must be fulfilled on pain of incurring liability under international law. It is thus all the more evident that an act is being committed which lacks any justification, reasonableness of any kind and is totally without legality. For its part, Circular No. /, on the subject of Reporting on strike days by all employees under the General Education Council?and addressed to departmental managements by the Department of Adjustments and Settlements of the General Education Council, states, with reference to the absence of teachers to participate in the strikes: In the case concerned here, it is a case of absence, justified by direct industrial action, i.e. not leave requested by the teacher, but failure to attend their place of work ? This circular implemented an administrative system for cases when teachers are absent to take part in industrial action, despite the fact that, for the educational body, the offence of strike is, in its own words, an absence justified by direct industrial action? It should be clear that the provincial state, which is the teachers?employer, cannot qualify an industrial action as legal or illegal, since it does not have the power to do so. Even if it did have such power, in so doing, it assumes the dual role or judge and party, and cannot claim to settle a dispute based on its own rules which censure all strikes by an incorrect and irrational qualification of illegality. The administrative authority cannot even qualify direct industrial action as such, since that decision is solely reserved for the courts.\n.It is quite clear that the deductions from wages, while not overturning the guarantee of the right to strike, equals to an unacceptable restriction of that right, since the provincial executive power thereby assumes powers that it does not possess. In the case of the teachers affected by the deductions from their pay, it conspires against the integrity of the salary, which is certainly of a subsistence nature, and thus unfairly affects the right of property, the inalienability of which is guaranteed by article  of the National Constitution.', 'March for an unspecified duration if agreement was not reached. From the list of issues raised by ATEN, workers were offered: () the standardization of non-remunerative bonus elements in the basic wage; () the elimination of performance-based benefits (for ATEN, presenteeism?, instead making such benefits an element of the basic wage; () a further guarantee of a wage increase of no less than  pesos for those who already earned the minimum amount; () a commitment to instruct the Neuqun Social Security Institute to make the necessary arrangements to increase the variable percentage of the teachers?retirement allowance; () the establishment of a working group on granting contract staff regular staff status and on social programming in the education sector (non-teaching staff); () with regard to wages, the amount offered reached and exceeded the fixed national levels, the base amount offered being , pesos.\n.The Government indicates that a wage agreement was effectively not reached. This prevented the provincial Government from pursuing a timely dialogue, without prejudice to the industrial action being taken by ATEN at the time. Nevertheless, another working group was established with finance officials from the Neuqun provincial authorities to find a solution to the wage claims raised during the dispute. While the negotiations were under way, the union took direct action which involved: () the non-initiation of the academic year; () the blocking of bridges; () the setting up of road blocks without warning in various parts of the province to cut off towns far from the provincial capital and to prevent commercial activity in the productive sector; () demonstrations in towns; and () threats of further action.\n.The Government adds that the situation described above prevented the normal progression of the academic year, which meant that children were prevented from attending school in a normal and regular way. This situation led to numerous complaints from parents, causing unrest among civil society. Subsequently, faced with the impossibility of continuing the negotiations, the provincial Government proceeded to issue a compulsory conciliation order with the aim of restoring the pre-dispute status quo, so that education workers could return to their normal and regular jobs and so that dialogue could be resumed with the trade union in a climate of social peace. Although the application of Act No.  on compulsory conciliation was rejected by the union, the provincial authorities nevertheless agreed to increase the pay of new teachers to , pesos, with due account to the geographical location concerned. This proposal was also rejected. It should be noted that the conciliation process provides an opportunity for settlement and rapprochement and that, by exercising their autonomy and by making mutual concessions, it is the parties themselves that reach an agreement that should in theory reconcile their underlying differences. In such circumstances, it is unacceptable for the parties involved to be subjected to measures which restrict their freedom of negotiation. The power to request compulsory conciliation for a limited period is vested exclusively in the State for the purposes of ensuring social peace, and in no way can it be considered to be a violation of the principles of freedom of association because it will always be established for a limited period.\n.According to the Government, it is of paramount importance to stress that schools in the Republic of Argentina not only provide a natural environment for educating children but also play a very important social role, as in many respects they exert a cohesive influence on various sectors of society, in particular in view of the fact that Neuqun Province occupies a vast territory, which means that many children have to travel many miles, often in adverse weather conditions, in order to attend school. Many publicly run schools in the Republic of Argentina therefore provide children with breakfast and lunch, which means that school attendance is of the utmost importance because the State provides additional support to families, taking into account that there are certain pockets of poverty in the region.\n.The Government states that, because the trade unions felt unsatisfied with the proposals by the provincial authorities, they decided to take direct action, leading to the occupation of the bridges linking the cities of Cipolletti and Neuqun. On  April , a road block was set up on national road No. , at Arroyito, where there is an intersection of the roads leading to the tourist areas of southern Argentina (Bariloche, Villa La Angostura, Caviahue, El Bolsn and San Martn de los Andes, among others). When they heard about this measure, the Neuqun provincial authorities announced that they would not allow such a blockage and the demonstrators were requested to carry out their protest in the area of the Carancho bridge, in order to provide road users with an alternative route. This request was ignored by the protesters, who at that point included not only teachers but members of different trade unions and political associations. The police force was then called in to enter into dialogue with the union authorities to prevent the demonstrators from blocking the abovementioned road and thus to protect the rights of third parties who had nothing to do with the matter in question to the freedom of movement (a freedom which is protected by the Constitution). No agreement was reached. It was at this point that the police proceeded to clear the way to enable the free movement of the vehicles that had been brought to a standstill. Minutes later, teacher Carlos Fuentealba was unfortunately killed when a tear gas canister was fired. The provincial authorities have since identified those responsible and reports have been prepared leading to the dismissal from the Neuqun police of the perpetrators of the unfortunate event, who have subsequently been handed over to justice. With regard to the legal proceedings, the judge responsible for the case has indicated that the citizen Jos Daro Poblete was detained after questioning on  April  and, after a court hearing on  April of the same year, on the basis of a final decision.\n.The contested Decree No.  declares a state of educational emergency throughout the province. It gives the Neuqun Province Education Council the power to appoint the interim managers and teaching staff needed in the various schools for the purpose of providing and guaranteeing an educational service and provides that such staff will be appointed until the situation returns to normal. This decision by the provincial authorities is in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Even though the education system is not considered to be an essential service, a crisis situation began to emerge when the academic year failed to begin, leading to unrest among parents and society as a whole. Thus, section  of the Decree in question that is being challenged by trade unions stipulates that the staff mentioned in section  will be appointed until the educational service returns to normal? Consequently, the claim that the Decree in question restricts freedom of association is categorically rejected, not only because the Decree was prepared in the spirit of the Committees recommendations, but also because the workers hired to provide replacement services for the strikers were recruited on an interim basis, as has been stated unequivocally. Significantly, the right to strike was not violated because the strike took place for the entire period called for by the union (two months) and wages are being paid to date for the days not worked as a result of participation in the strike, in accordance with an order by the board of the Neuqun Province Education Council, which is a tripartite body responsible for the implementation of the abovementioned Decree.\n.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainants allege that Mr Carlos Fuentealba was killed on  April  during a demonstration by education workers in Neuqun Province which was suppressed by the police, and object to Decree No.  of April  on educational emergency, issued by the authorities of Neuqun Province, authorizing the appointment of teachers on an interim basis until the end of the strike called by ATEN.\n.With regard to the allegation concerning the murder of teacher Mr Carlos Fuentealba, on  April , during a demonstration of education workers in Neuqun Province which was suppressed by the police, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: ()in the context of a dispute between ATEN and the authorities of the province in question, trade unions decided to take direct action which led to the occupation of bridges linking two cities and on  April  the establishment of a road block on national road No. , where there is an intersection of the roads leading to the tourist areas of southern Argentina; () the provincial authorities announced that they would not allow such a blockage and requested the demonstrators to carry out their protest in the area of the Carancho bridge, in order to provide road users with an alternative', 'do with freedom of association or collective bargaining.\n.First, the provincial authorities consider the complaint about the supposed violation of the right to engage in collective bargaining inadmissible. According to the provincial authorities, SUTEF started the dispute in order to collectively negotiate the total or partial derogation from, or replacement of, the legislation concerned. They therefore consider that the dispute lay outside the reach of collective bargaining with the employer, the subject being beyond the authority of the executive and collective bargaining possibilities. They further state that the legislation that gave rise to the dispute was not subject to collective bargaining as it does not involve matters relating to employment conditions but is instead strictly circumscribed within social security legislation.\n.Second, the provincial authorities assert that the allegations relating to the supposed violation of the employment rights (alleged precarious employment situation) of the so called facilitators?of cultural workshops should also be deemed inadmissible. They state that, although the allegations may be of concern to the trade unions, they do not come under the Committees remit. Without prejudice thereto, the provincial authorities provide additional information on the situation. First, they point out that the trade union status of SUTEF encompasses teaching staff providing services in state-run schools?and that the workshop facilitators are not covered by that definition since they do not provide services within the scope of State schools or the Ministry of Education (but rather the Culture Secretariat); SUTEF therefore cannot claim to represent those workers. Second, the provincial authorities indicate that the decisions taken by the authorities were intended to improve the management of the cultural workshops, which involved the adoption of a new regulatory framework following an exhaustive analysis (irregularities having been identified in its past application), and to strengthen the administrative and technical structure and ensure greater transparency, efficiency and effectiveness and better access for the general population. The provincial authorities provide detailed information on the procedure followed and consider the assertion that workers were reinstated on a discriminatory or criteria-free basis to be completely false (they also point out that many of the facilitators who complained were reinstated).\n.In a further preliminary statement, the provincial authorities indicate that the complainants omitted to provide information on the acts of violence that took place in the context of the industrial action. Those acts resulted in various judicial ?in some cases, criminal ?proceedings that are currently pending. The provincial Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security indicates that the dispute, which lasted for almost  days, prevented and obstructed not only educational but also government activities, owing to the fact that the protest surrounded the provincial seat of government, preventing public officials from entering the building. The Ministry indicates that the industrial action involved disproportionate violence, undemocratic slogans and criminal acts. It gives the following examples: (i) national road No. , the only overland route to the town of Ushuaia, was cut off despite repeated court injunctions to the contrary (leading to several criminal charges); (ii) in order to cut off the supply of fuel to the province, on  April , a fuel depot was blockaded and the premises surrounded by wood-burning pickets in a serious hazard to public safety; (iii) these acts were accompanied by highly threatening and intimidating demonstrations, as described in various criminal cases, different kinds of sabotage and damage to public property, and acts of aggression such as those publically inflicted on the Vice-Governor; and (iv) in the schools, workers trying to perform their duties were not only threated but also hurt. The provincial authorities consider that such displays of violence are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.\n.Referring to the alleged refusal to hold discussions and reinstate workers, the provincial authorities state that, despite the violence deployed in the industrial action, the Provincial Government reacted to the dispute by convening the trade unions in joint commissions in order to discuss the dispute among the items subject to the collective negotiation of working conditions. This proved impossible, however, because SUTEF refused, demanding to discuss only questions that were not subject to collective bargaining and refusing to stop the direct action it had started. The Provincial Government was therefore obliged to take appropriate measures to protect the rights of children attending public schools, and after days it decided to implement an exceptional and temporary class make-up programme. The provincial authorities specify that the programme was in no way an attempt to replace the striking workers; instead, in the face of the social harm caused by the prolongation of the dispute it sought to minimize the harmful consequences for children by establishing minimum services. The provincial authorities assert that, owing to the prolongation of the dispute, the provinces judicial authorities required the executive to consider the adoption of minimum services that would limit the damage being done. The Provincial Government, in adopting the class make-up programme called into question by the complainants, considered that the criteria established by the Committee were applicable to the strike in the education sector, noting that even though education could not, strictly speaking, be termed an essential service, in cases in which a dispute was extended the possibility of establishing minimum services was not an infringement of freedom of association, in particular taking into account the principle of the higher interest of the child. The provincial authorities further indicate that the exceptional conditions that gave rise to the programme were the result not only of the strike but also of the critical situation of the provinces education system. They deny that the programme was an attempt to replace the strikers since the make-up teachers had a different purpose (to make up for lost classes as additional human resources guaranteeing the right to learn); indeed, when a striking worker was reinstated, the two teaching functions were maintained alongside each other in the classroom. In addition, the make-up teachers were retained even after the dispute had ended and the decision was made to prolong the programme in question in the expectation that the exceptional situation would last longer since a great many classroom days had been lost.\n.Regarding the deductions made for days of strike, the provincial authorities recall that according to the Committee such deductions give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has not criticized the legislation of member States stipulating salary deductions for days of strike, and that the domestic regulations and case law take account of those principles and establish that, in the event that a service is not provided because of direct action, the employer has the right to make the relevant deductions. The provincial authorities indicate that the court of first instance dismissed the suit for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) filed by SUTEF in that regard.\n.Regarding the declaration that the strike was illegal, the Provincial Government states that, while it is not unaware of the Committees position that declarations of this type should not be made by an administrative body, it considers that the declaration did not imply any anti union practices. In that regard, the provincial authorities assert the following: (i) the strike, in addition to stopping education for more than three months, paralysed the Governments administrative and labour-related activities almost entirely, obliging the executive to issue Decree No. / of  March  declaring a state of administrative emergency; (ii) in Resolution No. /, the provincial Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security declared the industrial action carried out by SUTEF on  May  to be unlawful on the grounds that the grievance had nothing to do with the employment relationship and exceeded the purpose of a labour dispute ?in other words, on the grounds that the matter in dispute had nothing to do with the industrial relationship, there being no grievances involving labour or working conditions that could have been resolved by the provincial executive in its role as the employer; (iii) according to the case law and legal doctrine, industrial action must be decreed in the context of exclusively contractual disputes arising from the employment relationship, and the application for amparo filed by SUTEF was therefore dismissed at first instance, the judge considering that the strike was based on criticism of the law but that there was no evidence of a dispute with the state employer; (iv)of the more than  days of strike called in an attempt at widespread violence on the part of demonstrators and trade unionists, only one day was the subject of the declaration of unlawfulness; and (v) no measures or reprisals were adopted as a consequence of the declaration (it stipulated no effective legal consequences).\n.The Committee observes that this case concerns allegations of anti-union harassment and discrimination on the grounds of participation in industrial action, refusal to hold discussions, replacement of workers, salary deductions and declaring a strike illegal, in the context of an industrial dispute in the public education sector of Tierra del Fuego Province.\n.The Committee notes, on the']"

The Committee firmly expects that the necessary steps will be taken so that the Ministry can, without delay, take an appropriate decision with regard to the requests for recognition of representativeness that it has received, and so that representative workers?organizations and companies in the railways sector can regulate conditions of employment by means of collective bargaining.\n.The Committee recalls that it had requested the Government to confirm that trade union delegate Mr Ramn Daro Alcaraz, who had been dismissed from the ALL company in violation of his trade union immunity, had been reinstated without loss of pay in accordance with the order issued by the judicial authority. In this respect, the Committee notes the Governments statement that the said delegate has opted for payment of compensation and has left the company.\n.With regard to recommendations (b) and (d), the Committee regrets that, despite the seriousness of the allegations (exertion of pressure on trade union members to leave the union, non-recognition of the election of union delegates, threats of dismissal, etc.) dating back to , the Government merely informs it that information on the matter is still being gathered. The Committee reiterates its recommendations and firmly urges the Government to send its observations on the matter without delay.\n.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)\tThe Committee firmly expects that the necessary steps will be taken so that the Ministry can, without delay, take an appropriate decision with regard to the requests for recognition of representativeness that it has received, and so that the representative workers?organizations and companies in the railways sector can regulate conditions of employment by means of collective bargaining.(b)\tThe Committee firmly urges the Government to send its observations without delay on the following recommendations that it made at its meeting in November : (a) the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings with respect to unfair labour practices filed with regard to the alleged threats of dismissal of members of the APDFA and with respect to the sanction imposed on delegate Mr Daro Corbaln in the Ferrovas SA enterprise; and (b) the Committee regrets the Governments considerable delay in responding and urges it to carry out an investigation into the following allegations of anti union discrimination: () pressure on members to leave the union; refusal to recognize the election of delegates and to engage in dialogue with elected delegates; refusal to provide a notice board; prohibition of trade union assemblies and denial of trade union leave at Ferrosur SA; () denial of the legality of the trade union election procedure and refusal to recognize elected delegates at Amrica Latina Logstica Central and at Amrica Latina Logstica Mesopotmica; and () threats of dismissal of members at Ferrovas SA. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of the investigation.\n.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Association of Management Staff of Argentine Railways and General Ports Administration (APDFA) dated  October .\n.The Government sent its observations in a communication of May .\n.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  October , the APDFA states that, in accordance with the national legislation in force, the APDFA is a primary-level trade union with trade union status, pursuant to Decision No.  of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security. Accordingly, the APDFA enjoys legitimacy and has the capacity to present the complaint. The APDFA states that it is presenting this complaint against the Argentine State for multiple violations of freedom of association and the rights of workers?organizations and representatives guaranteed under Conventions Nos ,  and , and Workers?Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), in the form of acts of antiunion discrimination, harassment of trade union delegates and activists, and refusal to engage in collective bargaining, among other serious violations, committed by the Ferrosur SA, Roca SA, All Central and All Mesopotmica SA, Nuevo Central Argentino SA, Ferroexpreso Pampeano SA, Belgrano Cargas SA, Ferrovas SA and Ugofe SA enterprises. It states further that the complaint describes some of the serious acts contrary to freedom of association committed by three of these enterprises (Ferrosur SA, All Central and All Mesopotmica SA, and Ferrovas SA), with the complicity of the Ministry of Labour.\n.The APDFA points out that it groups together and represents all dependent employees of the railway sector working as managerial, administrative, technical and/or professional staff, university graduates holding qualifying degrees and currently performing those duties: coordinators, supervisors and all staff performing management, supervisory and control tasks, with or without subordinate staff, irrespective of their employment situation, without distinction based on occupational category, who are working in a dependent relationship in any enterprise in the sector, including state enterprises or companies at national or provincial level; public, private or mixed enterprises operating railway services; centralized or decentralized public service bodies engaged in activities related to railways; enterprises and/or bodies carrying out repairs and/or maintenance of railway equipment, control and/or operation of movable or fixed assets formerly owned by Ferrocarriles Argentinos and remaining within the remit of the State, control and/or supervision of the management and operation of railway service enterprises; employer enterprises that conclude agreements or contractual or subcontracting arrangements for the operation, sale or performance of tasks inherent in or ancillary to railway activity, industries engaged mainly in the production and/or repair of railway equipment and enterprises providing services to the railway sector. The unions coverage also includes managerial and executive staff working in Argentine ports. Its legally recognized geographical coverage is nationwide.\n.The APDFAs employer was originally the State, as the owner of Ferrocarriles Argentinos, the enterprise responsible for providing railway services on the different branch lines. In the s, however, the privatization policies implemented by the then Government led to the fragmentation of the railways, with concessions being granted for operation of the railway services to several private companies, which thus became the employers of the workers represented by the trade union. The APDFA emphasizes that, under the policies carried out in the s in Argentina, nearly all of the public service enterprises formerly owned by the State were privatized. The APDFAs position was to resist and oppose the Governments decisions to privatize, and to that end it launched a propaganda and public awareness plan to inform society of the serious consequences the process would entail. In response to the APDFAs militant activities, the employers, with the acquiescence of the State, retaliated by withdrawing recognition of the unions representative status; in fact, the workers represented by the union were required to leave the trade union as a condition for being transferred to the concessionaires ?in other words, for keeping their jobs. These reprisals, which constitute a violation of freedom of association, were decided and implemented by all of the enterprises referred to in the complaint: Ferrosur SA, Roca SA, All Central and All Mesopotmica SA, Nuevo Central Argentino SA, Ferroexpreso Pampeano SA, Belgrano Cargas SA, Ferrovas SA and Ugofe SA.\n.Since then, despite all the action taken by the APDFA, the union has been prevented from exercising the right to collective bargaining, notwithstanding the fact that, in accordance with the legal provisions, it initiated an administrative procedure with the Ministry of Labour requesting the establishment of a bargaining unit with all the concessionaires. By preventing collective bargaining, the employers achieved their goal: the workers covered by the relevant collective agreements while the railways were being operated by the State were removed from the scope of the agreements by the', 'Professionals, etc.) operate in the institution, along with ordinary associations of psychologists, biochemists, nurses, pharmacists, etc. This broad and non-exhaustive list of social partners within the scope of the Ministry of Health led to the signature in  of Decision No.  in the Joint Sectoral Committee for the Ministry of Health. The Government also draws attention to the full implementation of Article of Convention No. , with respect to trade union plurality, as set out in the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee.\n.The hospital indicates that, in the abovementioned Decision No. , it is agreed that: ?representation must meet objective requirements with regard to membership ? ?that representation to that effect may be exercised when proof is provided that it has as a minimum the support of at least  per cent of hospital employees ...?(section  of Act No.  on trade union associations). The hospital management notes in this regard that the ATE must prove that it has the support of that  per cent, which it has never done. Nevertheless, the authority in question has never questioned the nature of minority representation in the institution and has always endeavoured to work with the union.\n.As for the alleged discrimination against and failure to recognize the ATE by not providing it with union premises, as is required by law, it is emphasized that, given the particular characteristics of the institution (it is a public hospital where priority is given to patient care and ongoing staff training), and given that it is located in a building that cannot be extended, it does not currently have any free spaces that could be used for the requested purposes. Nevertheless, studies are currently being carried out into possible architectural modifications that would make it possible to provide a physical space for the development of trade union activities. With regard to the alleged rejection of a request for permission to put up a bulletin board, the institution categorically denies this allegation, as on various occasions it has authorized the placement of a bulletin board on the fifth floor in the main staff entrance hall, which is a area that the entire hospital staff has to pass through, on the condition that the cost of the bulletin board should be covered by the ATE. To date, no bulletin board has been put up in the space agreed upon with the representatives of that association, a situation that is certainly not attributable to the hospital, which in its reply stresses that the space in question is available. The institution states that, when agreement was reached with regard to the space in question, the union agreed that it would stop posting fliers on walls throughout the building.\n.As for the alleged reprisals against the union official, Ms Tarragona, the Government indicates that she is a nurse and works on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays in the out-of-hours medical unit. This unit provides a public service and deals with a high number of patients, especially on weekends, as the institution has an emergency medicine and trauma centre and so receives many accident victims; it should also be noted that the hospital is located near to several high-speed roads. Furthermore, the Government indicates that the hospital is located close to several recreation and dance establishments, which means that a significant number of patients receive medical attention for alcohol-related conditions and for injuries caused in accidents, especially during weekends. There are also the normal patient demands, for the treatment of various conditions. In the report, the director of the institution indicates that it is common knowledge that there is a lack of trained nursing staff, in both the public and the private sectors. However, efforts have continued to be made to make more nurses available in all of the hospitals departments, including the outof-hours medical unit. Accordingly, in recent months there has been a significant increase in the nursing staff, especially in the out-of-hours medical unit, which has had a new intake of six nurses. In the light of the above, the Government rejects the allegation that nurses were withdrawn from the out-of-hours medical unit intentionally to do a disservice to MsTarragona.\n.With regard to Order No. /DGARH/, under which, according to the ATE, MsTarragona was demoted to a lower grade, it is reported that on  February  there was a meeting of the Administrative Technical Advisory Committee (CATA), a body comprising the department heads of the hospitals administrative and professional technical services, union representatives of the Association of Municipal Physicians, SUTECBA and representatives of the hospital management and deputy management. At the meeting, the SUTECBA representative reported that some members of the nursing staff were classified as registered nurses but did not have the necessary qualifications, and requested the hospital management to investigate the alleged irregularity.\n.An assessment was made by human resources, which found that four staff members were on a pay scale that was applicable to registered nurses, while they were qualified as licensed practical nurses. These nurses included Ms Tarragona and three other people (who were named). This information was sent to the Ministry of Finance, which issued the order that is now being challenged (No. /DGARH/) to adjust the grades of the staff members accordingly. This is a matter that falls within the Ministry of Finances area of competence, given that it concerns the classification of staff in accordance with the effective verification of the qualifications of Ms Viviana Tarragona, Ms Ester Pelozo, MsRosa Prez and Ms Mara Cristina Vzquez. In other words, far from being harassment, their grades were adjusted to reflect their actual qualifications. No other aspects of the reviewed situation or work situation of Ms Tarragona or her reclassified colleagues were changed in any way.\n.With regard to the days deducted for having applied for union leave, the institution indicates that the deductions were made in April and May  and were repaid in accordance with Note No.  HGAJAF of  June . The deductions from September  were also repaid, following the proper and timely submission of the relevant documentation. It is stressed in conclusion that it is the spirit and policy of the hospital management (the current director has been working for the institution for years) to work in partnership with the different trade unions and associations, never losing sight of the fact that better working conditions for all will lead directly to the better delivery of health services to patients and setting out the shortcomings and difficulties faced by the institution, which are discussed with the union representatives of the bodies concerned.\n.The Government adds that the Director General for Administration in the Human Resources Management Unit of the Ministry of Finance of the government of the City of Buenos Aires sent a note that supports the observations made by the hospital management, to the effect that Ms Tarragonas reclassification was the result of an assessment of staff duties under the new system governing the administrative careers of city government officials, which has nothing whatsoever to do with her union activities; furthermore, the union official did not duly raise an objection to the measure challenged in this complaint in accordance with the procedural remedies at her disposal (Administrative Procedure Act).\n.The Committee notes that, in this case, the complainant organization, the ATE, alleges that the authorities of the Dr Juan A. Fernndez Hospital for Acute Medicine has, in a discriminatory way, failed to provide it with union premises for carrying out its trade union activities, has not given it a place for a bulletin board and that acts of anti-union harassment have been taken against one of its officials.\n.With regard to the allegation concerning the refusal to provide the ATE with premises for carrying out its trade union activities (according to the ATE, it has been demanding such premises since  and the hospital has made premises available to another trade union), the Committee notes that, according to the hospital in question: () several trade union associations (SUTECBA, the UPCN, the ATE, the Association of Municipal Physicians, the Association of Professionals, etc.) operate in the institution, as do ordinary associations of psychologists, biochemists, nurses, pharmacists, etc., and that the number of social partners led to the signature in  of Decision No.  in the Joint Sectoral Committee within the Ministry of Health; () in Decision No. , it was agreed that representation must meet objective requirements with regard to membership and that representation to that effect may be exercised when proof is provided that it has as a minimum the support of at least  per cent of hospital employees; () the ATE never provided proof of such support, but nevertheless the authority in question has never questioned the nature of minority representation in the institution and has always endeavoured to work with the trade union; () given the particular characteristics of the institution (it is a public hospital where priority is given to patient care and ongoing staff training) and, given that it is located in', 'a building that cannot be extended, it does not currently have any free spaces that could be used for the purposes requested by the ATE; () nevertheless, studies are currently being carried out into possible architectural modifications that would make it possible to provide a physical space for the development of trade union activities.\n.In this respect, while noting the difficulties in the hospital with regard to making union premises available to trade unions, the Committee notes with interest that studies are being carried out to find a solution to this issue. The Committee recalls that Convention No.  provides in its Article  that: (a) facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognized public employees?organizations as may be appropriate in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work; (b) the granting of such facilities shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned; and (c) the nature and scope of these facilities shall be determined in accordance with the methods referred to in Article  of this Convention, or by other appropriate means. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that, taking into account the provisions of the abovementioned Convention, the ATE and the hospital authorities will be able to reach a satisfactory agreement in this respect.\n.With regard to the refusal by the hospital authorities to provide a space for an ATE bulletin board, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () on various occasions, it gave the ATE permission to put up a bulletin board on the fifth floor in the main staff entrance hall, which is an area that the entire hospital staff has to pass through, on the condition that the cost of the bulletin board would be covered by the ATE; () to date, no bulletin board has been put up in the space agreed upon with the representatives of that trade union, a situation that is not attributable to the hospital, which has stressed that the space is available; and () when a space was provided for the bulletin board, the union agreed that it would not post fliers on walls throughout the building. In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.\n.With regard to the allegation that acts of anti-union harassment have been taken against one of its officials, Ms Viviana Claudia Tarragona (according to the complainant, these include undue deductions of workdays ?including those on which she applied for union leave ?work overload during her shift as a result of a decision to withdraw staff and modification of her professional grade ?and therefore her employment conditions ?causing her material damage), the Committee notes that, according to the Government: ()the trade union official in question is a nurse and works on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays in the out-of-hours medical unit, which provides a public service and deals with a high number of patients, especially during weekends, as the institution has an emergency medicine and trauma centre and receives many accident victims; () according to the director of the institution, it is common knowledge that there is a lack of trained nursing staff, in both the public and the private sectors, but there have nevertheless been ongoing efforts to make more nurses available in all of the hospitals departments, including the out-of-hours medical unit. Accordingly, in recent months there has been a significant increase in the nursing staff, especially in the out-of-hours medical unit, which has had a new addition of six nurses and, in the light of this, the allegation that nurses were withdrawn from the out-of-hours medical unit intentionally to do a disservice to MsTarragona cannot be sustained; () with regard to Order No. /DGARH/, under which, according to the ATE, Ms Tarragona was demoted to a lower grade; on February  there was a meeting of the CATA, a body comprising the department heads of the hospitals administrative and professional technical services, union representatives of the Association of Municipal Physicians and SUTECBA, and representatives of hospital management and, at the meeting, the SUTECBA representative reported that some members of the nursing staff were classified as being registered nurses but did not have the necessary qualifications and requested the hospital management to investigate the alleged irregularity; () an assessment was made of staff duties under the new system governing the administrative careers of city government officials, which found that four staff members were on a pay scale that was applicable to registered nurses, when they were qualified as licensed practical nurses; () Ms Tarragona and three other nurses were found to be in this situation. This information was sent to the Ministry of Finance, which issued the order that is now being challenged (No./DGARH/) to adjust the grades of the staff members accordingly (this is a matter that falls within its area of competence, given that it concerns the classification of staff in accordance with the effective verification of their qualifications); () far from being a form of harassment, the grades were adjusted to reflect their actual qualifications. No other aspects of the reviewed situation or work situation of Ms Tarragona or her reclassified colleagues were changed in any way; () with regard to the days deducted for having applied for union leave, the deductions were made in April and May  but were repaid in accordance with Note No.  HGAJAF of  June , and the deductions of September  were also repaid, following the proper and timely submission of the relevant documentation; and ()it is the spirit and policy of the hospital management to work in partnership with the different trade unions and associations, not losing sight of the fact that better working conditions for all will lead directly to the better delivery of health services to patients and setting out the shortcomings and difficulties faced by the institution, which are discussed with the union representatives of the bodies concerned. In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee expresses the hope that, taking into account the provisions of Convention No. , the ATE and the authorities of the Dr Juan A. Fernndez General Hospital for Acute Medicine will be able to reach a satisfactory agreement with regard to granting premises so that the trade union can carry out its activities.']"

The industrial action, which was lawful and had been notified to the labour authority, received voluntary mass support from teachers in Argentina, who withdrew from their duties. The complainant alleges that, in addition to the failure to convene the joint negotiation board, the State decided to reduce the share of the Compensation Fund (financed by the Government) received by the seven provinces facing the greatest difficulties.

By a decision of  April , the protective measure was granted in summary proceedings and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was ordered to convene within five days the negotiation board provided for by section  of Act No. .

The proceedings are in progress and no first-instance ruling had been issued by the end of May .\n.The UDA adds that on  March  the Government summoned the trade unions to a joint meeting during which it made a proposal consisting of the advance payment of one-off fixed sums not classified as remuneration (considered illegal and not generating contributions to the social security system) for serving employees, the payment being subject to non-implementation of the industrial action called for by the trade unions at the national level for  and  March . As the proposal was rejected, the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires did not put forward any other proposal but served notice of compulsory conciliation on the trade unions. The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on  March  secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On  March , the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.\n.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.).
