The Committee recalls that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. The Committee further recalls that the detention of trade unionists for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular [see Compilation, paras  and ].\n.As regards its recommendation (b), the Committee deeply regrets that the Government once again refuses to send copies of the court rulings requested. In this regard, the Committee must emphasize that the right to a fair and public hearing implies the right for the ruling or decision to be made public and that the publicizing of decisions is an important safeguard in the interest of the individual and of society at large. The Committee also hopes that the Government will understand that, given the contradictory information received from the parties, and the fact that it has been denied access to the relevant court rulings, it cannot abandon its examination of the allegations concerned. The Committee recalls in this regard, that, on numerous occasions where the complainants alleged that trade union officials or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof, and the outcome of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations [see Compilation, paras  and ].\n.Furthermore, the Committee expresses its deep concern about the serious allegations of the arrest and one-year prison sentence following a summary trial, of trade unionist, Mr Humberto Bello Lafita, at the end of . The Committee notes the Government s indication that Mr Bello Lafita was charged with spreading an epidemic and failing to comply with penalties, and received a one-year prison service, which he is serving at a correctional facility. It requests the Government to provide it with a copy of the conviction and to ensure that no workers are arrested for their trade union activity.\n.Regarding recommendation (c) (request for an investigation into all allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms reported by the complainant organization), the Committee notes that the Government reiterates previously submitted statements, according to which Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Emilio Gottardi, Mr Ral Zerguera Borrell, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pedro Scull, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez, Mr Hiosvani Pupo, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr William Esmrido Cruz, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Beldarrain, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Mr Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet, Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez, Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio and Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar are not truly trade unionists and were not tried or convicted for activities relating to the exercise of trade union freedoms.\n.The Committee also observes that the above-mentioned further allegations made by the complainant organization warn of continuing violations of the public freedoms of trade unionists, and that, in this regard, the Government once again rejects the allegations of repression, persecution, harassment, victimization, illegal raids on homes and targeted arrests, indicating that these individuals are not trade union leaders and that, in some cases, these citizens were arrested for common offences, and accusing ASIC and its officials of serving foreign interests to bring about a regime change. The Committee also observes that it has yet to receive information on ASIC s allegations contained in its communication dated  December . The Committee requests the Government to provide its observations in this regard.\n.While it notes the continuing discrepancies between the allegations made and the complete denial of these allegations by the Government, the Committee once again recalls that, while persons engaged in trade union activities or holding trade union office cannot claim immunity in respect of the ordinary criminal law, trade union activities should not in themselves be used by the public authorities as a pretext for the arbitrary arrest or detention of trade unionists. The apprehension and systematic or arbitrary interrogation by the police of trade union leaders and unionists involves a danger of abuse and could constitute a serious attack on trade union rights [see Compilation, paras  and ]. The Committee also recalls that all appropriate measures should be taken to guarantee that, irrespective of trade union affiliation, trade union rights can be exercised in normal conditions with respect for basic human rights and in a climate free of violence, pressure, fear and threats of any kind [see Compilation, para. ].\n.In light of the above, the Committee deplores that the Government has not taken the necessary measures, beyond the information that it provides, for the investigation of all the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms regarding the aforementioned individuals, including the new allegations made by the complainant organization since the last examination of the case. The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to carry out the investigation in question, and requests it to provide further detailed information regarding each of the above-mentioned individuals and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the above-mentioned allegations.\n.Regarding recommendation (d) (alleged restrictions imposed on ASIC members on travelling outside the country to participate in international activities in connection with their trade union work), the Committee observes that the Government once again denies the existence of restrictions and repeats what it had already indicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that, in its most recent allegations, the complainant organization reports cyber sabotage carried out by the public authorities to prevent ASIC trade unionists from participating in international online events with other trade union organizations. The Committee observes in this regard that the Government also considers that these are false allegations and unfounded accusations, and that the restrictions on access to the Internet and information technology are due to the blockade imposed on the country. The Committee also notes that the complainant organization alleges that the reported restrictions cannot be considered as limitations on access that apply to all persons in the country, and emphasizes that such limitations were targeted at specific events and individuals, and that in other cases, there were no problems in accessing these Internet communication services.\n.While the Committee reiterates that trade unionists, just like all persons, should enjoy freedom of movement and that, in particular, they should enjoy the right, subject to national legislation, which should not be such so as to violate freedom of association principles, to participate in trade union activities abroad [see Compilation, para. ], it reminds the Government that the right of ASIC officials and members to organize and freely exercise their trade union activities, including when these activities are conducted outside the country or when they involve participation in international online forums.\n.Concerning recommendation (e) (alleged restrictions on the right to the freedom of movement of ASIC officials and members in Cuban territory), the Committee notes that the Government once again disagrees with the allegations of restrictions on the right to free movement. While noting the diverging versions of events of the Government and the complainant organization, the Committee observes that the complainant organization reports new restrictions on the exercise of freedom of association in this regard (for example, allegations of threats and orders for some trade unionists not to leave their homes in the context of a demonstration organized by civil society groups on  November ). In this regard, the Committee must recall that the right to demonstrate peacefully in order to defend the occupational interests of workers is a fundamental aspect of trade union rights. The Committee therefore firmly urges the Government to fully ensure that ASIC officials have the freedom of movement in the national territory to carry out their trade union activities, including participation in demonstrations to defend the interests of their members, without Government interference.\n.As regards the anti-union dismissals of Mr"", ""Lzaro Roberto Aguiar Mendoza; ASIC provincial secretary, Mr Yorsi Kelin Snchez Perdign; members Mr Ismael Castro Valentn and Ms Dania Marit Noriega Castriz; trade union journalist Ms Yunia Figueredo Cruz; another ASIC member, Mr Yolsdan Armenteros Vzquez; activists Mr Luis Orlando Len Randich, Mr Ulises Gonzlez, Ms Yaquelin Dalis Caballero, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, as well as provincial secretaries Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln and Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi; and ASIC general secretary, Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo; the independent trade unionist Ms Maybell Padilla Prez; independent trade unionists Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo, Mr Charles Rodriguez; Ms Yaquelin Snchez Batista; Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Carlos Javier Gmez Guevara, Mr Rodolfo Aparicio Alemn; and provincial secretary Mr Livn Monteagudo Rivero (see paragraph , subparagraphs (a) to (k) above).\n.With regard to the persons referred to specifically in the new allegations, the Committee notes that the Government provides the following: (i) Mr Juan Alberto de la Nuez Ramrez: it is false to claim that he was arrested on  February . There is no evidence in any police record that this citizen was arrested, let alone detained in a Ministry of the Interior facility; (ii) Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez: neither he, nor his children or wife, have been victims of threats, persecution or harassment, but rather they committed acts designated as breaches of public order (communication dated  February ); (iii) Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi: on  February  he was fined an amount of  Cuban pesos, under paragraph (h) of Decree Law No. , for attempting to breach a security measure on the public highway. There is no evidence of any other action against this person; (iv) Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar: he has not had an employment relationship since , he is neither a leader nor representative of any trade union organization and there is no evidence of police surveillance against him; (v) Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo: relevant investigations were carried out and no link to ASIC was established in respect of this citizen. According to the Government, it was known that this was a person with numerous previous convictions. There is no evidence in any police records that any action was taken to detain him on  March  or on  April , as indicated in the allegations; (vi) Mr Humberto Bello Laffita: following investigations, it has been established that this citizen has had no links to ASIC. This person was the subject of sanctions in November  for failing to comply with the measures ordered by the health authorities to curb the COVID- pandemic. He was the subject of a criminal prosecution in case No. /, acknowledging his responsibility for the acts for which he was charged. The trial was held with all the guarantees established by criminal law and, at the time of sentencing, the court took into account the previous conduct of the accused who had been prosecuted for the offences of illegal currency trafficking, theft, contempt and resistance. He was also officially warned about conduct likely to encourage prostitution. It is false to claim that he is in solitary confinement. Mr Humberto Bello Laffita enjoys the conditions required for Cuban prisons, including the ' ' facility where he is serving his sentence. He has electricity, water and the possibility of making telephone calls and receiving visits from family members; (vii) Mr Yunier Herrera Rodrguez: it is false to state that he was arrested for peacefully claiming trade union rights. He was arrested when found inebriated on the public highway shouting abusive phrases, totally unrelated to labour or trade union matters; lastly, (viii) the Government denies the allegations that seven ASIC activists and officials were arrested in early February  and rejects the allegations of interrogation or detention concerning Luis Orlando Len Randich and Yaqueln Snchez Batista.\n.The Committee cannot fail to once again note the diverging versions of events of the Government and the complainant and the fact that the Government continues to deny the alleged acts.\n.While the Government continues to list the offences or details of previous legal proceedings against various persons (including illicit economic activities, handling stolen goods, causing damage, public disorder, antisocial behaviour) mentioned both in recommendation (b) of the last report on the present case and in ASIC s new allegations, the Committee regrets to note that it has still not provided information on the commission of such offences, nor has it annexed documents on the relevant investigations or copies of rulings, as the Committee noted in previous conclusions concerning the present case. The Committee recalls in this regard that on numerous occasions where the complainants alleged that trade union officials or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests had been made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the alleged arrests, particularly in connection with the judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof, and the outcome of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations. It also recalls that in many cases, it has asked the government concerned to communicate the texts of any judgments that have been delivered together with the grounds adduced therefor [see Compilation, paras  and ]. In these circumstances, in order to be able to examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee again requests the Government to provide the outcome of the investigations carried out and, if applicable, the court rulings concerning the union members or officials in respect of whom the Government states that they are engaged in inappropriate social behaviour and/or have committed offences, including public order offences, in particular: Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Willian Cruz Delgado, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Baldarran, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene, Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez, and Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo.\n.The Committee also deeply regrets that the Government once again refuses to send a copy of the court ruling handed down against Mr Humberto Bello Laffita sentencing him to a one-year prison term. The Committee requests the Government to do so without further delay. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that no workers are arrested for their trade union activities.\n.Regarding recommendation (c) (conducting an investigation into the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms) raised in the communication dated  December , referring to the situation of Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, ASIC general secretary, threatened by the DSE that his parole would be revoked and that he would be charged with mercenary activity, the Committee notes that the Government refers to the information it provided on recommendation (b), in other words merely recalling that Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo is currently serving the remainder of his sentence in freedom, meaning that under existing criminal legislation he must fulfil certain obligations. Noting both this information and the complainant's repeated allegations about the many restrictions to which Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo is allegedly subject, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that Mr Hernndez Carrillo can freely carry out his legitimate trade union activities.\n.Regarding recommendation (d) (alleged restrictions on travelling outside the country to participate in international activities in connection with their trade union work), the Committee observes that the Government once again denies the existence of restrictions, repeating what it had already indicated to the Committee. While noting the diverging versions of events of the Government and the complainant, the Committee observes that the complainant reports new restrictions on travelling (as in the case of ASIC deputy general secretary, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, for denouncing the Government s anti-union practices at the th Session of the International Labour Conference (communication dated  March ). The Committee also notes that, in its most recent allegations, the complainant reports that the authorities continue to use the repressive weapon of cutting off communications to prevent ASIC trade unionists from participating in international online events with other trade union organizations (communications dated  and  September ). The Committee observes in this regard that the Government also stresses that these are false allegations and unfounded accusations, and that the restrictions on access to the internet and information technology are due to the blockade imposed on the country.\n.In light of the foregoing and the complainant s new allegations in the case, the Committee recalls that it has highlighted that trade unionists, just like all persons, should enjoy freedom of movement and that, in particular, they should enjoy the right, subject to national legislation, which should not be such so as to violate freedom of association principles, to participate in trade union activities abroad [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee strongly urges the Government to ensure"", ""the time of sentencing, the court took into account the previous conduct of the accused who had been prosecuted for the offences of illegal currency trafficking, theft, contempt and resistance. He was also officially warned about conduct likely to encourage prostitution. It is false to claim that he is in solitary confinement. Mr Humberto Bello Laffita enjoys the conditions required for Cuban prisons, including the '  ' facility where he is serving his sentence. He has electricity, water and the possibility of making telephone calls and receiving visits from family members; (vii) Mr Yunier Herrera Rodrguez: it is false to state that he was arrested for peacefully claiming trade union rights. He was arrested when found inebriated on the public highway shouting abusive phrases, totally unrelated to labour or trade union matters; (viii) lastly the Government denies the allegations that seven ASIC activists and officials were arrested in early February  and rejects the allegations of interrogation or detention concerning Luis Orlando Len Randich and Yaqueln Snchez Batista.\n.With regard to the disturbances that occurred on  July , referred to in the allegation letter, the Government indicates, in its communication dated  October , that: (i) peace was disturbed for the deliberate purpose of subverting the constitutional order. There was a very serious incitement to violence in the country, causing injuries and endangering collective security and the lives of citizens, officials and law enforcement officers. Property and facilities were damaged and destroyed; (ii) no one was arrested or punished for exercising their constitutionally recognized rights, including their labour and trade union rights; and (iii) the ILO complaints mechanism cannot be used to settle issues unrelated to alleged violations of freedom of association. There is an attempt to make people believe that there is a  wave of repression' in the country against alleged independent trade unionists, which is doubly false, given that there is neither repression nor are the persons mentioned in the allegation submitted trade unionists.\n.The Government indicates that, since the receipt of the communication of  April , a thorough investigation has been conducted into the list of persons submitted as an annex. There is no evidence of the dissemination of this alleged list of workers, let alone that anyone has been threatened because of it or because it was drawn up. In particular, the alleged threats to Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez have not been proven.\n.The Committee recalls that this complaint concerns several allegations of acts of aggression, harassment, persecution, arrests, assault and restrictions on the free movement of trade union officials and members while carrying out their functions by state security forces. The complainant also denounces its non-recognition by the Government.\n.As regards recommendation (a) (recognition and free operation of ASIC), the Committee notes that the Government once again stresses that: (i) ASIC is not a trade union organization; ASIC members do not have employment relationships, do not belong to any labour collective and therefore have not been elected or appointed by the members as trade union representatives; they do not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests, nor do they have the genuine support of the membership or any labour collective; and (ii) its supposed members answer to a foreign government, which provides them with funds in the political aim of subverting the legitimately established internal order.\n.In this regard, the Committee firstly recalls that, for several decades, it has been examining allegations of non-recognition and interference by the Government in the free operation of trade union organizations not affiliated to the Confederation of Workers of Cuba [see Cases Nos , , ,  and  of the Committee on Freedom of Association]. The Committee also recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since this is the first step that workers' or employers' organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately; and a long registration procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the establishment of organizations and amounts to a denial of the right of workers to establish organizations without previous authorization. It further recalls that freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities without any interference by the public authorities [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras ,  and ]. Considering that, according to the information provided by the complainant, some trade union members and officials mentioned in the complaint were self-employed workers, and that others had been dismissed for anti-union reasons, the Committee secondly recalls that that the criterion for determining the persons covered by the right to organize is not based on the existence of an employment relationship. Workers who do not have employment contracts should have the right to form the organizations of their choosing if they so wish [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee reiterates that in its initial examination of this case, it had noted that ASIC, in its founding declaration of principles, advocates trade union autonomy in the framework of the rule of law, aims to promote full compliance with ILO international labour standards and proclaims that it will not compromise or associate itself with party-political activities. In its union constitution, ASIC states that its key objectives include grouping together independent trade unions and reporting violations of international labour standards. Moreover, ASIC members' duties as set out in the union constitution include defending workers' claims and benefits. It is in this context that the Committee observes that the elements of ASIC s declaration of principles and union constitution fall within the scope of action and definition of a workers' organization. The Committee can only regret that there has been no progress since its last examination of this case and therefore once again refers to its previous conclusions and once more strongly urges the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition, and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.\n.Regarding recommendation (b) (investigations into the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms with respect to certain union activists and officials), the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication dated  October , provides information about the members identified in the said recommendation, indicating or reiterating that the persons in question: (i) do not have, or have not had, employment relationships (Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Ms Ariadna Mena, Mr Ral Domingo Zerguera Borren, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Ms Yadislandia Hurtado Bicet, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene); (ii) continue to engage in inappropriate social behaviour and/or have committed offences, including public order offences (Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Willian Cruz Delgado, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Baldarran, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene, Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez); (iii) have never been subject to police action, such as arrests, ill treatment and isolation, or any other kind of action such as travel restrictions (Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Ral Domingo Zerguera Borren, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Lisan Zamora Ricardo, Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez, Ms Consuelo Rodriguez Hernndez, Ms Mailn Ricardo Gngora); (iv) reside overseas (Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar, Mr Pave Herrera Hernndez, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez, Mr Hiosvani Pupo, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez); (v) have died (Mr Pedro Scull); and/or (vi) have already been subject to comments by the Government (Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi, Mr Willian Cruz Delgado, Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Humberto Jos Bello Laffita).\n.While taking due note of the Government s reply, the Committee cannot fail to observe the numerous additional allegations made by the complainant regarding the commission of new acts of anti-union discrimination, in particular arbitrary arrests, threats of deprivation of liberty and various acts of harassment against ASIC members and officials. The Committee notes that ASIC even reports intensified repression by state security agencies against its union officials and activists, with the declared objective of putting an end to ASIC.\n.The Committee notes in this respect that, in the numerous communications received since its last examination of the present case, the complainant alleges that ASIC members and officials are constantly subjected to threats and to frequent brief but arbitrary and intimidating arrests by state security agencies, including: the trade union activist Mr Juan Alberto de la Nuez Ramrez; the activist Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo; ASIC general secretary in the province of Holgun and his family; ASIC provincial secretary, Mr Ibn Guerra Hernndez, and his wife Ms Kety Martnez; ASIC national executive member, Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes Consuegras; ASIC representative Ms Consuelo Rodrguez Hernndez and her husband Mr""]"
