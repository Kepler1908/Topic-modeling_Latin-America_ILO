The trade union leaders did not meet any more, as they feared for their safety.- The harassment of trade unions spread to a number of enterprises under the protection of the army in the private sector. On  and  May,  trade union leaders were dismissed from ""Home of Champions"", a US enterprise which produces baseballs and which is located in Cit Soleil. One month later, four other trade union leaders were also dismissed by the enterprise. When the director of the enterprise called the trade union leaders into his office to inform them of their dismissal, he stated that ""this is not the right time to be a trade unionist"".- The trade union leaders employed by three other US enterprises were also dismissed. They too reported anti-trade union statements made by management. Nine trade unionists were dismissed from the ""Michico"" enterprise which produces textile products, and eight from the ""Chancerelles Manufacturing"" enterprise which produces women\'s lingerie.- The management of the US ""Automatic Accusonic"" enterprise had a different but just as effective approach to destroying the enterprise\'s trade union. The factory was temporarily closed, and when it reopened it was declared a ""union-free"" company. None of the trade union leaders or trade unionists were re-employed. When the President of the trade union asked for them to be reinstated, he was severely beaten and his arm was broken.\n.The ICFTU later sent supplementary information, which was obtained during a mission to Haiti from  to  January , reporting that the trade unionist Cajuste Lexinste, the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Workers, Phabonord Saint Vil, the secretary of the organization, and Sauveur Orlus, the CGT\'s General Secretary in Gros Morne, were arrested on  April  and transferred to the main anti-gang squad, where they were tortured because they wanted to distribute a press release to protest against the arrest of several members of the CGT in Gros Morne.\n.Furthermore, according to the ICFTU, on  February  more than  workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CAMEP) were dismissed for having taken union training courses organized by the Trade Union of Workers, Employees and Temporary Workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (SOETRATEC). On  November  the members of the executive of this trade union had already been dismissed. Finally, on  March , Joseph Michelet, a member of the trade union of workers of Larco Frres SA, a union affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested, subjected to intensive interrogation on the Haitian crisis, and then released.\n.The complaint of the WCL in Case No. , dated  March , addresses the fact that the Confederation of Haitian Workers (CTH), an organization affiliated with the WCL, has been the subject for many months of all sorts of administrative harassment. Its occupational organizations, and particularly the National Federation of Agricultural Workers and Haitian Farmers (FENATAPA), the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, the National Federation of Industrial Workers and Subcontractors (FENATIS), and the Association of Newspaper Workers (ATPGA), are regularly hindered from exercising their trade union activities. Many of their members have been arrested or tortured, or have disappeared. Namely, there have been the following cases:- On  October , Pierre Andr Mertyl was tortured. There has still been no response to the complaint filed by the lawyers of the CTH (Confederation of Haitian Workers).- On  December , Webert Mars, a worker at the FENATAPA pig farm in Jrmie, was tortured for no reason by Joseph Jean-Franois, a corporal in the army, and by Kesnel Guerrier.- On  January , Baselet Derival, a member of the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, was arrested, imprisoned and tortured. He was held at the Faustin Soulouque barracks in Petit-Goave.- Pierre Trechelet, the brother of a member of the Executive Committee of the CTH, has been reported missing.- On  January , Raynold Belizaire, a member of the FENATIS, was shot twice while he was in his private home.- On  January , Estimable Jean-Emile, a correspondent of Radio Cacique and a member of the Democratic Youth Movement (affiliated with the Young Farmers\' Association of Plagie-AJPL, which is an association under the FENATAPA) was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by Mr. Gls, the head of the third section of Marchand Dessalines.\n.The WCL goes on to explain that the possibility of holding trade union meetings without prior authorization, which is a fundamental right of workers and their organizations, was being flouted in Haiti. Indeed, on  January , the head of the fifth communal section of St. Marc (Tibordet - Antibonite region), prohibited a FENATAPA meeting which was to be chaired by Arsne Lebrun, the General Secretary of the Organization. The request for authorization was rejected by the authorities.\n.Furthermore, according to the WCL, freedom of opinion and the right to information and to training, which are rights recognized as part of the free exercise of trade union rights, are also violated in Haiti. On  January , Jean Elder Almeus, a member of the ATPGA (Newspaper Workers\' Association of Grand\'Anse), was arrested while he participated in the ""Truth on the Drum"" programme broadcast by Radio Vision.\n.Finally, on  December , during the arrest of three active members of the National Federation of Agricultural Workers and Haitian Farmers (FENATAPA) (they have since been released), audiovisual material including inter alia equipment and documents used for training of the rural population was confiscated by second-lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Ravix.\n.The complaint of the commission of the General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) sent in communications dated  April  and  May  (Case No. ), confirms the illegal dismissal, under the pretext of lack of funds, of  workers personally identified by the director of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CAMEP) on  February  as sympathizers of the SOETRATEC. This national trade union organization also reiterates the information according to which these dismissals followed the dismissal of  members of the SOETRATEC singled out by name, including the members of the trade unions\' executive, as early as  November , under the pretext that the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CANEP) did not have any more money to pay them. The complainant organization explains that under President Aristide, the SOETRATEC held regular trade union meetings to deal with workers\' problems and union affairs, and the members of this union had taken trade union training courses. The complainant organization points out that on  March  the SOETRATEC sent a letter to the director of the labour service of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but that nothing was done in response to this letter.\n.CLAT, for its part, denounces the grenade attack in Jrmie on  June  of which Serge Paul, an important leader of the Confederation of Haitian Workers (CTH), was reportedly a victim. This attack reportedly led to the death of his two children and seriously injured a third child. CLAT adds that this union leader and six of his collaborators were reportedly arrested while organizing a seminar in Jrmie. Furthermore, the Deputy Secretary-General of the CTH, Louis Octave Dorvilier, was reportedly held by four armed individuals; he was abducted into a van blindfolded, kicked, tortured and then abandoned. The General-Secretary himself, Jean-Claude Lebrun, was reportedly threatened. Finally, three members of an organization in Marceline (Cap Perin South), Gerthin Augustin, Gabriel Louine and Romain Castra were abducted into a van, license number , on a road in Ption Villi; their whereabouts are as yet unknown.\n.The Committee observes that these cases concern extremely serious allegations of violations of freedom of association by the military authorities who were exercising actual control in Haiti. Even in the absence of a reply on the substance of the case from the present democratic Government, which cannot be held responsible for these acts, the Committee has to determine which principles of freedom of association are at stake in these affairs so as to make it possible for the Government which has been restored to its prerogatives and functions in Haiti to redress these violations. Considering the scope of the issues involved, the Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is at its disposal.\n.The Committee notes that the violations of freedom of association in these cases related to the total absence of public democratic freedoms, characterized by measures of intimidation and anti-union harassment which had prompted trade unionists to go into exile and had involved murders, arrests, torture, abductions, dismissals, transfers of trade unionists, arson attacks against their places of work or residence, brutal repression of demonstrations or trade union meetings, the establishment of new trade unions by the military authorities and serious violations of trade unionists\' rights to freedom of opinion, information and training.\n.The Committee recalls that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists and with respect for basic human rights (see Digest of decisions and principles of the', 'hold trade union meetings.
