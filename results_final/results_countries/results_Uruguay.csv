0,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Federation of Secondary School Teachers (FENAPES) and Education International (EI) dated  November . The Inter-Union Assembly of Workers orkers' National Convention (PIT CNT) sent a communication in November  stating its support for the complaint. FENAPES sent additional information in communications dated  February,  April,  May and  September .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May,  August and  December , as well as  April .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications dated  November ,  February,  April,  May and  September , the complainant organizations allege that as from , following the change of government, the new education authorities began to limit various forms of trade union action. The complainants allege specifically that the Directorate-General for Secondary Education (DGES), a decentralized body of the National Public Education Administration (ANEP), has through various decisions and actions violated freedom of association in a number of secondary education establishments (liceos ' high schools) in the country, to the detriment of the FENAPES, the most representative trade union in public secondary education, and its activists.
.The complainants allege that this anti-union policy has been manifested through the implementation of repressive disciplinary procedures with regard to the performance of union activities, namely: (i) anti-union repression with threats of dismissal against teachers at High School No.  in the department of San Jos on account of union activities; (ii) an investigation into the participation of FENAPES leaders in an activity with teachers from the high school in Canelones; (iii) an investigation into the use of the union noticeboard by teachers at High School No.  in Montevideo; (iv) anti-union acts aimed at limiting and suppressing the use of trade union leave; and (v) disregard for collective bargaining and interference by the DGES authorities in relation to the Association of Secondary Education Non-Teaching Staff (ATES).
.The complainants indicate that on  October  a plebiscite on constitutional reform with respect to the subject of security in Uruguay was held at the same time as presidential elections. They indicate that, together with other organizations, including the PIT CNT, they carried out various actions to contribute to the campaign against this constitutional reform, which was instigated by certain political sectors and in the end was not approved. The complainants indicate that the proposal for reform gave rise to intense public debate because it included aspects of major social interest, including the forming of a national guard trained by the military, the possibility of establishing reviewable penalties of permanent imprisonment, and the demarcation of alternative measures to prison. They also indicate that the debate on reform included various social organizations concerned with the defence of human rights, academic circles, the political parties and especially the trade union and student movements. The complainants indicate that those who opposed the constitutional reform adopted the motto that fear was not the way, advocating education as the way to tackle problems of insecurity and initiating a campaign against the proposal.
.The complainants indicate that as part of this campaign, which included publicity on the radio and television and through billboards, FENAPES activists and members went to take photos of each other with a banner proclaiming  No to the reform'  with a view to posting the images on social networks. The complainants allege that: (i) during the evening of  October , activists from the Teachers' Association of the department of San Jos, affiliated to FENAPES, assembled at High School No. ; (ii) eight teachers took photos of each other on the public thoroughfare near the school and six teachers did so inside the school but in spaces for the use of teachers during breaks between classes; (iii) on  October , the principal of the school reported this activity to the DGES, being of the view that secularism had been violated since the activity constituted propaganda, resulting in the establishment of an administrative file, which ended up being archived; (iv) in June , with the change of government and new authorities at the DGES (formerly the Secondary Education Board (CES)), the school principal persisted with her previous complaint, the file was reopened, and an investigation was ordered into incidents that had occurred a year earlier, without the teachers being granted the right of defence; this culminated in a final report which contains errors, omitting to mention the trade union nature of the activity that took place on  October , and condemning freedom of expression on a subject of public interest; (v) the intention to cause harm to the union was evident and a context of public censure of the activists was created (no measures were taken against teachers who influenced students in favour of the constitutional reform): (vi) even though the proceedings against those who took photos outside the school were concluded without any liability being established, the decision indicated that the activity constituted political propaganda, dismissing its union nature; and (vii) the legal advisers proposed that the teachers who took photos inside the school premises should be dismissed, with the exception of two cases in which it was agreed that such a sanction would be excessive.
.The complainants consider that the report produced by the attorney acting in the investigation committed an inexcusable error, in denying the union nature of the activity that took place on  October , clearly indicating his malicious and repressive intent through the sentence:  The undersigned considers that, in a situation such as this, the reason  why' no longer predominates and  where' the activity takes place assumes vital importance.' The complainants indicate that the prohibition on propaganda or proselytism is established by article  of the Constitution of Uruguay, which provides that:  In workplaces and during working hours, any activity unrelated to official duties shall be prohibited and any activity for propaganda purposes of any kind shall be deemed unlawful.' In other words, the constitutional provision itself requires the intention or ultimate aim of the activity to be stated. The complainants consider that the omission of any mention of the union nature of the activity opened the way for censure of the exercise of freedom of expression on a subject of public interest, also ignoring the terms of article  of the Constitution, which promotes the right to organize. The complainants consider that a coherent interpretation of both articles would have enabled the investigator to conclude that article  actually bans political propaganda, while article  places all union activities under the protection of the ban established by article , and establishes an obligation to promote them.
.The complainants allege that on  September  the CES decided to initiate an investigation into a suspected violation of the principle of secularism by FENAPES leaders for assembling at Empalme Olmos High School in October  with the intention of establishing communication with the members of the union branch at that school, as part of a mobilization of students against the constitutional reform (the students had denounced limitations imposed by the school management on the right of assembly and expression by the students' union).
.The complainants allege that: (i) in April , the principal of Montevideo High School No.  reported the fact that informative material on the referendum against a law entitled the  Urgent Consideration Act' (LUC) had appeared on the trade union noticeboard at the school, further to which the DGES ordered an investigation to be launched; and (ii) the existence of trade union material on the noticeboard is normal and so the investigation under way (of a disciplinary nature and without any guarantees) can only constitute harassment by the employer in reprisal for the kind of material displayed on the noticeboard, and is therefore a clear act of interference for the purposes of anti-union repression.
.The complainants allege that since the change of government a number of hostile actions were recorded calling into question the use of trade union leave by FENAPES and they allege that: (i) the principal of San Jos High School No.  reported the allegedly excessive use of paid hours for the purposes of trade union activity, pointing out that an inappropriate legal basis had been used to justify this (the complaint was directed against the teacher and FENAPES leader Mr Marcel Slamovitz); and (ii) the anti-union actions of the principal began to receive the backing of a parliamentarian belonging to one of the parties in the government coalition who accused the authorities of the previous government and FENAPES of having issued false certificates for trade union leave. The complainants indicate that on account of the above a commission was set up in the National Parliament with the mandate to investigate the granting and justification of irregular union leave",0,2022,Uruguay
1,"to FENAPES members by the CES during the '  period.
.The complainants indicate that on account of the above-mentioned complaint an administrative investigation was launched at the DGES into the hours used by Mr Slamovitz for trade union purposes and that, although the investigating counsel suggested that the investigation should be archived since there did not appear to be any elements that called for action to be taken, the DGES ordered the suspension of the teacher from his post for  days with total deduction of pay for gross misconduct on account of using  trade union power' to mislead the school principal. The complainants indicate that as part of the investigation it was decided to file a criminal complaint against the teacher for allegedly excessive use of paid hours for trade union activity and also against other members of the FENAPES executive committee, seeking to classify the union leaders' activity as a criminal offence for having issued and used false records of union activity in the context of agreements concluded with the authorities of that time. The complainants allege that the education authorities are calling for the imprisonment of the union leaders who argue that there are no formalities in the collective bargaining process, postulating formal bases over and above the basic elements that in themselves form the core of negotiations, as illustrated by Professor Barreto in a report attached to the complaint, who indicates that there are no formal requirements for registering agreements and that the lack of such requirements does not affect the validity of what is agreed upon. This report mentions that Resolution No  of Record No.  of  features an agreement concluded in the context of collective bargaining in the  Working Group on trade union immunity' comprising the ANEP and the PIT CNT and indicates that the said agreement also refers to other agreements that may be concluded, which would demonstrate the interplay of different existing bargaining processes.
.The complainants allege that the investigating commission set up in Parliament operated outside the legal framework, with the clear intent of persecution of the trade union, and indicate that what the commission was investigating was not the misuse of time for trade union activity but whether or not an appropriate legal basis had been used to justify such time, also launching a media campaign against FENAPES. The complainants indicate that the key issue was the unwritten agreement concluded at the time between FENAPES and the former authorities so that hours taken for union activities in excess of those fixed by the agreement signed in  could be justified by invoking section . of the Teaching Staff Regulations (EFD). The complainants indicate that there are no formalities of any kind in Uruguayan law that require that an agreement must be in writing, whether in the public or private sphere, and that customary compliance with the terms of an agreement also contributes to the understanding that an agreement exists even if not in writing. The complainants indicate that the investigating commission concluded its activity with two final reports.
.The complainants allege that: (i) in , the Coordinating Committee of Uruguayan Teaching Unions (CSEU), to which FENAPES belongs, signed a collective agreement with the ANEP regulating the use of trade union leave by the leaders of the ATES; (ii) in October , the DGES issued Decision No.  unilaterally regulating, in total disregard for the above-mentioned collective agreement, the allocation of trade union hours for the ATES, prescribing that only named officials on a staff list shall be authorized to be members of representative committees and shall not be replaced by other officials, thereby committing interference that violates trade union autonomy; and (iii) this decision also prescribes that the records of hours taken for trade union activity shall be signed by the DGES or the ATES president and, in the case of the latter s trade union hours, by the secretary designated for such purposes; if established hours are exceeded, these shall be deducted, with retroactive effect, thereby constituting interference in trade union activity and restricting the free exercise thereof.
.The complainants indicate that the above-mentioned collective agreement had established the number of officials who were union members (whether or not they paid union dues) as a basis for calculating the number of free hours paid. The complainants allege that for the period from  March  to  February , the secondary education authorities changed the aforementioned criterion, excluding teachers who were union members but did not pay union dues, thereby reducing the number of units corresponding to union leave. It is alleged that this action has affected the exercise of freedom of association with a possible impact on the quality of collective bargaining.
.The complainants mention other facts in the complaint which, in their view, enable the context of anti-union repression which started in  to be understood and indicate that: (i) on  May , the ANEP issued a decision ordering the removal of all banners that might infringe upon the guiding principles of education (secularism and the ban on propaganda); and (ii) FENAPES filed a complaint in this respect with the National Human Rights Institution (INDDHH), an impartial body under the aegis of Parliament, which issued a decision recommending the deletion of the most controversial sections of the above-mentioned decision. The complainants indicate that they have brought another complaint before the INDDHH, in which various situations are described, including the ban on holding union meetings inside the school or at its entrance in the context of a stoppage held by a branch of FENAPES.
.In its communications of  May,  August and  December , as well as  April , the Government indicates that the ANEP is an autonomous entity with legal personality which governs public education and comprises the following bodies: the Central Executive Board (CODICEN), the Directorate-General for Initial and Primary Education, the DGES (formerly the CES), the Directorate-General for Vocational and Technical Education and the Educational Training Board. The Government indicates that the ANEP has always been open to dialogue and to the negotiating bodies and that it respects and complies with all the laws and regulations in force, and so it is untrue that there have been violations of rights or of legal standards as invoked in the complaint. The Government affirms that the anti-union persecution denounced in the allegations does not exist, and that what is denounced as an attack on freedom of association is quite simply the need for the country s legal system to be respected.
.The Government considers that the complaint does not reveal any elements that demonstrate action aimed at violating trade union autonomy or discriminatory anti-union conduct by the State and affirms that the DGES exercised the legitimate powers conferred on it by law, that its action arose on reasonable grounds that warranted investigation and that at no time was union activity investigated but the conduct of officials bound to the Administration by a set of regulations governing their behaviour.
.With regard to the incidents concerning San Jos High School No. , the Government indicates that: (i) the secondary education authorities which took office in May  received an official letter from the principal of the school requesting information on a complaint made in  to the CES concerning photos taken by a group of teachers inside the school with banners bearing the words  No to the constitutional reform' (which had nothing to do with the right to organize but related to issues of public safety); the principal had indicated that she had not been notified of any decision relating to the file which had been opened on account of her complaint; (ii) the CES of the time, having been apprised of the complaint, dealt with it in session, ordered it to be shelved, merely issuing an exhortation to be careful with attitudes (despite the fact that the Legal Division of the CES had suggested that an administrative investigation should be carried out), and did not notify the school principal of the action taken on her complaint; after a reasonable time, the principal asked for information in this regard; (iii) the CES authorities located the file and reopened it, as well as reopening five other files relating to similar situations on which no decision had been issued; and (iv) in August , the CES Legal Division suggested that an administrative investigation should be ordered to determine whether or not administrative infringements had been committed violating the provisions of the EFD and the Management Staff Regulations, and in September  the CES, on a unanimous vote of its three members (one of whom belonged to trade union circles), decided to order the opening of that investigation.
.The Government indicates that as a result of the administrative investigation (under section  of Ordinance No. ), it was found that an administrative infringement had been committed and summary proceedings were ordered against a number of teaching officials. The Government emphasizes that what was investigated was not trade union activity but actions",1,2022,Uruguay
2,"by public officials which contravened constitutional standards, that the officials concerned enjoyed guarantees of due process and that the proposed sanction of dismissal was rejected by the education authorities. The Government points out that the Administration has the duty to investigate any act that may constitute a violation of the regulations and for which professional liability can be incurred, and that having established the existence of an administrative infringement and having identified those responsible, the disciplinary powers of the Administration came into play. In this regard, the Government states that the action of the ANEP through the decentralized DGES did not involve any violation of freedom of association, or any restriction of freedom of expression, but was in line with the duties imposed by the Constitution and the law to avoid any kind of propaganda and to preserve secularism in education. The Government indicates that the proceedings were concluded with a decision issued by the DGES, whereby a sanction was imposed on the teachers of  days' suspension with deduction of pay, the period of suspension already served during the proceedings being subtracted. The Government emphasizes that there was no anti-union persecution or any selective dismissal aimed at penalizing the union members, but that the stages of the proceedings were followed whose purpose is to provide guarantees, not to penalize or persecute, and are covered by the legal provisions in force. The Government informs that none of the sanctioned teachers appealed the sanctions. The Government also indicates that the files relating to the officials who took photos outside the school, on the public thoroughfare, were archived once it had been established that no administrative infringement had been committed.
.The Government indicates that although a trade union has the right to define measures that it will adopt with regard to any event or occurrence, whether political, cultural or otherwise, in this case the teachers took photos of each other inside the school, which is their workplace, and article  of the Constitution provides that:  In workplaces and during working hours, any activity unrelated to official duties shall be prohibited, and any kind of activity for propaganda purposes shall be deemed unlawful. Groups may not be formed for propaganda purposes by using the titles of public agencies or invoking any link with official duties in the context of membership of such groups'  Propaganda is strictly forbidden under article  of the Constitution and freedom of expression or trade union rights cannot be invoked in order to circumvent the prohibition. Any propaganda engaged in by teachers in public education constitutes a twofold infringement: of the legal provisions banning propaganda, and of the provision that orders teaching to be carried out in accordance with the principle of secularism (section  of the General Education Act and section  of the EFD). The Government stresses that this case involves public officials governed by a set of regulations; that it is not about teachers being denied the possibility of expressing themselves; the issue is that they did so inside the school in various offices and during working hours since evening classes were in progress at that time and that the constitutional reform in question. had no connection with trade union rights or with public education regulations but was related to the subject of public safety in Uruguay.
.The Government indicates that: (i) the Schools Inspectorate informed the CES that the students at the school had used scarves with the slogan  No to the constitutional reform' while participating in union meetings inside the school, and it noted a violation of the right of freedom and of the principle of secularism and indicated that the students did not have the authorization of the school management required under the terms of the Student Regulations (in force since ); (ii) the CES Legal Division agreed with the suggestion of the Schools Inspectorate that, in line with the regulations in force, an administrative investigation should be conducted in order to elucidate the facts, but no element emerged that amounted to anti-union persecution or reprisals of any sort with regard to FENAPES members, an organization which does not represent the students; and (iii) the administrative investigation was closed without any liability having been established on the part of any official (DGES decision of  February ).
.The Government indicates that: (i) the school management reported to the DGES that on  March  material was found referring to the Urgent Consideration Act (LUC) (promulgated on  July ) inside the registration office on the upper floor of the school (leaflets concerning a political campaign for the collection of signatures aimed at the repeal of the Act, which has nothing to do with union rights); (ii) the DGES, following the suggestion of the Legal Division, ordered the opening of an investigation to determine the facts and apportion responsibility; (iii) the action of the DGES was in line with the law and upheld all the principles that govern public education; and (iv) a number of teachers, regardless of whether they were union members, featured in the investigation, which was closed without any liability having been established on the part of any official (DGES decision of  December ).
.The Government also mentions that banners referring to the campaign against the LUC were placed on the facade of the school and an order was given to remove the banners from the facade but not to remove the banners located in the vicinity of this or any other school, this being done to defend the principle of secularism, the preservation of which does not affect freedom of expression or freedom of association. The Government indicates that recital (VI) of CODICEN decision states as follows:  There is no intention to violate or restrict the legitimate right to use trade union noticeboards, nor to limit, restrict, violate or interfere with the exercise of freedom'  The Government has annexed a copy of an amparo [protection of constitutional rights] judgment handed down in  (the Government points out that at that time the authorities of the ANEP were different, appointed by the Government prior to the one that took office in March ) and which obliges the ANEP to remove proselytising/propaganda banners from the facades of its premises. In this judgment, the Administrative Court of First Instance indicated that the banners had a clear political message that undoubtedly constituted proselytising activity and that the banners violated neutrality. Based on the above, the Court ordered the ANEP to prohibit the placement of banners (on that occasion put up by the students) relating to the constitutional reform or with similar content on the facade of any other of its buildings.
.With regard to the complaint filed with the National Human Rights Institution and Ombuds Office (INDDHH), the Government recalls that neither the ANEP nor any other public entity has any dependent link with the aforementioned institution and that it has no obligation to comply with any instruction issued by it, and so it stated that it did not accept its opinion. The ANEP brought invalidation proceedings in the Court for Administrative Disputes (TCA) and this case is currently being examined by the Supreme Court of Justice. What was prescribed by CODICEN (part of the ANEP) does not constitute any element of anti-union repression since it was addressed to its own offices and the order was issued for the purpose of upholding constitutional principles.
.The Government refers to the complaint made by the principal of San Jos High School No.  in  for  allegedly excessive use of paid hours for the purpose of trade union activity and the use of an inappropriate legal basis to justify them'  which was backed by a parliamentarian from one of the political parties comprising the government coalition. In this regard, the Government indicates above all that at no time was action taken by the ANEP, through the DGES, that could constitute anti-union persecution. The Government points out that the existence of provisions regulating the use of trade union leave in the sphere of the ANEP cannot be ignored and that if faced with alleged irregularities the Administration has the power and the duty to review its own acts. The Government emphasizes that this cannot be regarded as anti-union action but action directly and solely related to compliance with legal standards.
.With regard to the teacher Mr Slamovitz, the Government indicates that: (i) after analysing the findings of the investigation, the head of the DGES Legal Division suggested that administrative proceedings should be opened in relation to the teacher; the Government explains that the head of the DGES Legal Division is not bound by the statements of the investigator and may or may not concur with the preliminary report and, if appropriate, may issue a different opinion; (ii) accordingly, administrative proceedings were ordered in the present case, with the application of precautionary measures (suspension from duties and a  per cent pay deduction), within the scope of the regulations in force (Ordinance No.  of ); (iii)",1,2022,Uruguay
3,"this was not about anti-union persecution or discrimination but solely involved the exercise of the disciplinary power of the Administration, in that summary proceedings (that is, proceedings for determining or proving the liability of the official against whom charges have been brought) are ordered for alleged gross misconduct on account of misusing hours for trade union purposes; (iv) the summary proceedings were conducted with the guarantees of due process and were not ordered for the purpose of investigating or calling into question the teacher s trade union activity but rather his action as an official in breach of the regulations in force; (v) although the official, as a trade union leader, can exercise his right to paid time off for the exercise of union activity, such exercise is regulated by the Wages Board or through collective agreements; and (vi) various accords or agreements (all in writing) have been concluded and the hours allocated for union leave have been specified in each case but at no time do the agreements or other decisions cited by the complainants refer to the use of section . of the EFD in order to justify hours for union purposes.
.The Government indicates that the head of the Legal Division indicated in his report that he disagreed with the investigator s conclusions and that in his view it was not legally possible that the former CES authorities could have concluded an agreement with FENAPES in a valid manner (accepting the applicability of section . of the EFD to justify excessive use of hours for union purposes) since that would have violated the provisions of the teaching regulations and would have exceeded the scope of its competencies and hierarchical powers. The report of the Legal Division also indicates that nobody was able to substantiate the existence of the alleged agreement and that under no circumstances can trade union leave be made up for by the application of section . of the EFD (reference is made in section  to special leave for teaching officials which shall be granted for special tasks or services assigned by CODICEN, by the respective individual boards or as required by other state bodies, in accordance with explicit legal provisions). According to the Government, the aforementioned section is clear and under no circumstances can it be used to justify trade union leave. The Government points out that although the complainants based their position on an alleged  verbal agreement' with the former CES authorities, an agreement of that nature is inconceivable where one of the parties is the State, in this case the ANEP. Furthermore, although the complainants maintain that there are no formalities for collective agreements, the actual facts show that those concluded between CODICEN and the CSEU were in written form. The Government emphasizes that the regulation of trade union leave arises from the agreement signed between CODICEN and the CSEU, embodied in Resolution No  of Record No.  dated  December , which establishes year by year the ceiling on the number of hours corresponding to trade union leave. The Government has attached a copy of this Resolution. The Government indicates that the above-mentioned agreement of  makes no reference to the use of section . of the EFD. The Government states that there was no agreement containing justification of union leave based on section . of the EFD and that Resolution No  of Record No.  of  December , to which the complainant organizations refer, does not mention anything in this regard either. The Government attaches a press release in which the former CODICEN president, Mr Wilson Netto, reportedly pointed out the  illegality' of applying the above-mentioned section to justify union leave.
.The Government indicates that FENAPES issued countless  records' of trade union activity to present to the school principals, requesting  justification of the absence' of the official in question  in accordance with section . of the EFD in line with the agreement signed between CODICEN and the CSEU'  Although the school principals accepted the excess hours taken by delegates as free time for union activity, they did so on the basis of a misleading record issued by the union authorities, which prompted the justification of absences by referring to a  signed' agreement (which, it has been accepted, was non-existent, as was any verbal  signature' , and with the indication (supposedly backed up by the non-existent agreement) that the absence was covered by section . of the EFD (a legal provision which has nothing to do with union leave). The Government explains that it was the large number of absences that Mr Slamovitz attempted to justify on the basis of such records that caused the principal of High School No.  to contact the CES in  to find out what was the  agreement signed between CODICEN and the CSEU' to which FENAPES referred, given that the lost classroom hours were causing major disruption to the work of education.
.The Government indicates that with over  absences in two years on the part of Mr Slamovitz having been established, the proceedings concluded that there had been gross administrative misconduct and a sanction of  days' suspension with deduction of pay was imposed on him, the period of suspension already served during the proceedings being subtracted. The Government emphasizes that this lawful decision does not constitute anti-union persecution or discrimination by the State but solely amounts to the exercise of the Administration s disciplinary power. On the basis of the above, the Government emphasizes that the ANEP, through the DGES, acted within the scope of its competencies and never committed any violation of freedom of association or engaged in any sort of anti-union persecution.
.With regard to the filing of the criminal complaint against Mr Slamovitz and other members of the FENAPES executive committee, the Government indicates that all public officials have the duty to report the existence of circumstances that appear to be criminal and to bring them to the attention of the justice system so that they can be investigated and resolved. The Government explains that nothing has been  classified' as a crime and emphasizes that the terms of the DGES decision are not a consequence of exercising the right to take union leave or of performing  an activity inherent in the collective right to work'  as claimed by the complainants.
.With regard to the parliamentary commission, the Government indicates that this body did not assume any power that it does not possess, that it did not violate the regulations governing the operation of parliamentary commissions, that it did not act unlawfully, that it had no intention of interfering in trade union autonomy or in the collective bargaining process, nor was there any attempt at criminalization, but that it fulfilled its purpose, which was to conduct the investigation. The Government asserts that what was undertaken was an investigation into the activity of public officials, who beyond the weekly hours of union leave made use of leave on the basis of a formula which stated that the absence was justified under section . of the EFD, in accordance with an agreement which was never presented despite being asked for by various bodies. All this activity, related to the granting and justification of leave taken during the '  period, which was the subject of investigation by the parliamentary commission, caused enormous damage to the students since those hours, unlike the hours for union activity, did not give grounds for the provision of a replacement teacher, as stated in the previous reply.
.The commission which had the task of investigating the granting and justification of irregular leave to FENAPES members by the CES during the '  period ended its activity by concluding that there had been negligence on the part of the comptroller of authorities during that period (' ), resulting in omissions, administrative irregularities and apparently criminal conduct by public officials who were members of FENAPES and of the CES in the '  period, and for this reason it referred the investigated activities to the ANEP Central Executive Board, the Transparency and Public Ethics Board and the Public Prosecutor s Office.
.The Government indicates that the alleged interference by the DGES in the sphere of union leave is untrue, given that the latter was bound to carry out a study and analysis of union leave, since there were no administrative acts which properly regulated the use of union leave by the ATES and the corresponding control mechanisms had not been established. The Government points out that the reasoning behind Decision No.  was to bring order into what had occurred until then, with the aim of ensuring that all officials would make use of the hours actually allocated to them for the purposes of union leave. The decision approved the lists presented by the ATES with the corresponding number of hours that formed the basis for union leave and the number of hours for each official, and setting the maximum",1,2022,Uruguay
4,"number of hours that could be justified for union leave. The motive for the DGES decision was the improper justification of union leave, grossly exceeding the hours allocated to the union for each official on the basis of the number of union members. The Government indicates that FENAPES applied to the Court for Administrative Disputes (TCA) for the act to be revoked and possibly declared null and void, and so no final ruling has yet been issued and the DGES may revoke it wholly or partially.
.The Government adds that this situation is also being dealt with in a tripartite collective bargaining body. The Government explains that in the complaint FENAPES does not allege non-compliance on the part of these bodies towards itself but only refers to those relating to the ATES, citing the refusal of the Director-General for Secondary Education, but omitting to mention that it was the verbal aggression against the Director-General committed by the ATES president in a tripartite body which caused the temporary suspension of the negotiations. The Government indicates that the union did not request bipartite or tripartite meetings until March , when the negotiations were launched.
.In general terms, the Government affirms that, far from finding the actions of the public education authorities to be a violation of the international and national standards which protect freedom of association, these authorities have properly discharged their powers and duties, both in investigating the liability that might have been incurred by the union or any of its members in violating the  law of the land' which Convention No.  requires to be respected, and in putting into practice common-sense rules for the use of trade union leave. The Government emphasizes that the administrative proceedings which were initiated (administrative investigations and summary proceedings) were based on actual proven facts and are regulated by the standards and principles of the rule of law itself, and that all decisions can be challenged through administrative appeals, and that there is judicial control of all such administrative activity.
.The Government emphasizes that the Constitution does not exempt unions of officials (established under article  of the Constitution) from the restriction established in article  stating that:  In workplaces and during working hours, any activity unrelated to official duties shall be prohibited, and any activity for propaganda purposes of any kind shall be deemed unlawful.' It also indicates that although the complainants refer to a  public media campaign against FENAPES'  there has not been a single press release aimed at undermining the trade union or encouraging public rejection of it. The Government affirms that FENAPES continues to fully exercise freedom of association, freely organizing its union activity, and all that is required of it is full respect for the provisions of applicable law and agreements.
.The Committee notes the allegation of the complainant organizations in the present complaint that since the change of government in March  the education authorities, in particular the Directorate-General for Secondary Education (DGES) (formerly the Secondary Education Board (CES)) at the National Public Education Administration (ANEP) placed various limitations on the trade union activities of the National Federation of Secondary School Teachers (FENAPES), the most representative organization in the sphere of public secondary education, and its activists. The Committee notes that the Government denies that there has been any anti-union persecution, asserts that the ANEP has always been open to dialogue, and that what is being denounced as an attack on freedom of association is merely the requirement for the country s legal order to be respected. The Government indicates that the DGES exercised the legitimate powers conferred on it by law and that at no time was trade union activity investigated but the conduct of officials bound to the Administration by a set of regulations governing their conduct.
.The Committee notes the complainants' allegation that the anti-union policy expressed itself through a series of incidents that took place in different parts of the country and are described below:
.The Committee notes the complainants' allegation that as a result of complaints made by the principals of the high schools to the DGES between late  and early  for alleged violations of the guiding principles of education (secularism and prohibition of propaganda), the DGES conducted a series of disciplinary investigations without safeguards involving trade union leaders, who were penalized for their views, resulting in an environment of public censure of the activists. The Committee notes that the investigations involving the three high schools were concerned with the participation of FENAPES leaders in activities of an allegedly union nature and were related to a plebiscite on constitutional reform relating to issues of public safety and a referendum on a law entitled the Urgent Consideration Act (LUC).
.The Committee notes the Government s indication that the investigations relating to activities carried out in the high schools in Canelones and Montevideo (in the latter case, a number of teachers featured in the investigations, regardless of whether or not they were union members) were closed since no liability on the part of any official was established.
.With regard to San Jos High School No. , the Committee observes that the investigation by the DGES focused on teachers and trade union leaders who took photos of each other inside and outside the school, during the evening, with banners indicating their rejection of the constitutional reform related to public safety. The Committee notes that while the complainants indicate that the union activists took care to exercise their right of expression outside the school premises and without the presence of students, the Government indicates that the photos were taken when evening classes were in progress. The Committee observes that the complainants emphasize, among other things, that the DGES conducted the investigation without granting the teachers the right of defence and that it culminated with a report which omits to mention the union nature of the activity and condemns the exercise of free speech with respect to a topic which had generated intense public debate since it included aspects of major social interest. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s indication that the constitutional reform had nothing to do with trade union rights or public education but was related to issues of public safety, it affirms that the public servants enjoyed the guarantees of due process and that there was no anti-union persecution, and it emphasizes that what was investigated was not union activity but actions by teachers as public servants in breach of constitutional standards, in particular article , which bans propaganda/proselytism.
.The Committee notes the complainants' and the Government s indications that: (i) the investigations of the persons who took photos of each other on the public thoroughfare near the school were concluded without establishing any liability (since it was demonstrated that no administrative infringement had been committed); (ii) the proposal to dismiss the teachers who had taken photos inside the school was dropped; and (iii) a sanction of  days' suspension with deduction of pay was imposed. The Committee notes that, according to the Government s information, none of the sanctioned teachers appealed the sanctions.
.The Committee notes that the complainants also allege that in  the ANEP issued a decision demanding that FENAPES remove banners relating to the campaign against the LUC which were on the facade of different high schools. The Committee notes that although the complainants indicate that they reported this incident to an impartial parliamentary body (INDDHH), which recommended that the most controversial sections of the decision should be removed, the Government indicates that the decision was based on defence of the principle of secularism and explains that it did not order the removal of the banners located  in the vicinity' of the high schools but only those that were on the facades. It also indicates that the ANEP is not dependent on the INDDHH and that it brought invalidation proceedings in the Court for Administrative Disputes (TCA) but these have not yet been settled. The Committee notes that the Government has annexed a copy of a judgement issued in June  concerning an amparo action that ordered the ANEP to prohibit the placement of posters (on that occasion put up by students) relating to the constitutional reform on public safety issues or with similar content on the facade of any other of its buildings. The Committee also notes FENAPES' indication that it brought another complaint before the INDDHH relating to other situations such as the ban on holding union meetings on school premises. The Committee has no further information regarding this other complaint.
.The Committee observes that article  of the Constitution of Uruguay promotes the organization of trade unions and article  provides that public officials are in the service of the nation and not of any political faction, and that in workplaces and during working hours any activity unrelated to official duties shall be prohibited, and any kind of activity for propaganda purposes shall be deemed unlawful. The Committee notes that while the complainants consider that a coherent interpretation of",1,2022,Uruguay
5,"articles  and  of the Constitution suggests that article  bans political propaganda while article  places trade union activities under the protection of that ban, the Government emphasizes that propaganda of any kind is prohibited by article  and the prohibition cannot be circumvented by invoking freedom of expression or trade union rights. The Government also indicates that when a teacher in public education engages in propaganda, this entails a twofold infringement: of the legal provision that bans propaganda, and of the provision prescribing that teaching shall be carried out in accordance with the principle of secularism (section  of the General Education Act and section  of the EFD Teaching Staff Regulations).
.The Committee notes that it is clear from the above-mentioned details that: (i) six members or trade union leaders of FENAPES were sanctioned with six months' suspension with deduction of pay for having taken and then disseminated photos in a high school to express their opposition to a constitutional reform concerning public safety issues; and (ii) the public administration had ordered the removal banners put up in various high schools in relation to a referendum on a law, which contained, inter alia, provisions relating to the exercise of the right to strike. The Committee notes that, in both cases, the Government considers that the duty of neutrality and impartiality of teachers vis--vis students was violated and that, in the first case, the referendum in question concerned a constitutional reform totally unrelated to the interests of the trade union and its members. The Committee notes that FENAPES, for its part, considers that the activities in question were fully within the scope of trade union activity and should have therefore been protected.
.The Committee recalls that freedom of opinion and expression constitutes one of the basic civil liberties essential for the normal expression of trade union rights and that in a previous case it requested a government to ensure that public officials' trade unions have the possibility to express their views publicly on the wider economic and social policy questions which have a direct impact on their members' interests [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee takes note of the substantial nature of the sanctions imposed on the members or trade union leaders of FENAPES for having taken and then disseminated photos in a high school to express their opposition to a constitutional reform, and stresses the importance that they be effectively proportional to the offences committed so that in the future they do not have a deterrent effect on the action of trade union organizations in situations that involve the defence of their members' interests. Likewise, in relation to the two cases referred to above, the Committee considers that a reasonable balance should be established between the obligation of political neutrality of public teachers in the educational field established by the Constitution of Uruguay and the right of teachers' organizations to express their opinions on economic and social policy questions that may affect their members and to be able to disseminate them in the workplace, bearing in mind the need not to impair the education of the children. The Committee requests the Government to ensure the existence of such a balance and to take any necessary action in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the invalidation proceedings brought in the Court for Administrative Disputes (TCA) relating to the removal of banners from the schools' facades, and also of the status of the other complaint filed by FENAPES with the INDDHH relating to the ban on holding union meetings on school premises.
.The Committee notes the complainants' allegation that since the change of government a number of hostile actions were recorded calling into question the use of trade union leave by FENAPES, referring to two specific incidents: (i) a complaint made by the principal of High School No.  to the DGES concerning the excessive use of hours for union activity, which resulted in the DGES conducting an investigation into the hours used by the teacher and FENAPES leader Mr Marcel Slamovitz for union activity; and (ii) the setting up of a parliamentary commission to investigate the granting and justification of irregular leave for FENAPES members by the CES during the '  period (in order to establish whether or not an appropriate legal basis had been used to justify the hours for union activity ' in particular, the use of section . of the Teaching Staff Regulations (EFD) to justify hours of union leave).
.With regard to Mr Slamovitz, the Committee notes the allegations that: (i) the DGES ordered the suspension of this teacher from his post for  days with total deduction of pay for gross misconduct on account of the use of  trade union power' to mislead the school principal; and (ii) in the context of the investigation it was decided to file a criminal complaint against this teacher and other FENAPES leaders, seeking possible criminalization of the union leaders' conduct for issuing and using false records of union activity in the context of agreements concluded with the authorities at that time. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s indication that: (i) the more than  absences in two years led the school principal to contact the CES to obtain more details of the certificates used to justify such absences; (ii) the investigation was conducted under the guarantees of due process and determined the existence of gross administrative misconduct for using  trade union power' to mislead the school principal; and (iii) every public official has the duty to report the existence of circumstances that appear to be criminal and to bring them to the attention of the justice system so that the latter can investigate and resolve them.
.The Committee observes that, according to the complaint and the Government s reply, FENAPES issued  records' of trade union activity to present to the school principals, requesting  justification of the absence' of the official in accordance with section . of the Teaching Staff Regulations (EFD). The Committee observes that said section refers to extraordinary leave of teaching staff that  is granted for special tasks or services entrusted by the Central Board of Directors, by the respective Boards or required by other state agencies, in compliance with express legal provisions'  The Committee observes that the complainants affirm that: (i) a non-written agreement had been duly concluded between FENAPES and the previous authorities to justify any hours for union activity in excess of those specified by agreement by invoking section . of the EFD; (ii) there are no formalities of any kind in Uruguayan law that require that an agreement must be in writing, whether in the public or private sphere, and (iii) customary compliance with the terms of an agreement also contributes to the understanding that an agreement exists even if not in writing. The Committee observes that, for its part, the Government indicates that: (i) when the school principals accepted the excess hours taken by the delegates as free time for union activity, they did so on the basis of a misleading record issued by the union, which induced justification of the absences through reference to an agreement (whose existence could not be proven) with the indication (supposedly backed up by the non-existent agreement) that the absence was covered by section . of the EFD (which has nothing to do with union leave); (ii) the DGES considered that it was not legally possible that the former authorities could have agreed that section . of the EFD was applicable to justify the excessive use of hours for union activity, since that would have violated the statutory regulations and exceeded the scope of their competencies; (iii) it is inconceivable that there could have been a verbal agreement on this matter since one of the parties was the State; and (iv) the regulation of trade union leave arises from the agreement signed between CODICEN and the Coordinating Committee of Uruguayan Teaching Unions (CSEU), embodied in Resolution No.  of Record No.  dated  December , which establishes year by year the ceiling on the number of hours corresponding to trade union leave and this agreement makes no reference to the use of section . of the EFD to justify trade union leave.
.With regard to the parliamentary commission, the Committee notes that while the complainants indicate that there was unlawful conduct with the clear intention of persecution and condemnation of freedom of association, the collective bargaining process between FENAPES and the CES of that time having been called into question, the Government indicates that the commission neither acted illegally nor sought to interfere in trade union autonomy or in the collective bargaining process, nor was there any attempt at criminalization, but that it investigated the actions of public officials who, beyond the hours of leave for trade union activity, made use of leave",1,2022,Uruguay
6,"based on a formula indicating that the justification of absence was covered by section . of the EFD, in line with an agreement which was never presented despite this having been requested by various bodies.
.The Committee notes that the commission concluded its activity with two reports: (i) a majority report, drawn up by the government coalition, which concludes that there was negligence on the part of the comptroller of authorities at that time (' ), resulting in administrative irregularities and conduct that appeared to be of a criminal nature by public officials belonging to FENAPES and members of the CES, and so the activity of the commission was referred to the ANEP, the Transparency and Public Ethics Board and the Public Prosecutor s Office; and (ii) a minority report, voted on by members of the outgoing government party, which highlighted the violation of the right of defence of the FENAPES leaders and concluded that no criminal acts had been established and hence it should be for the administrative authorities to conduct an investigation and impose sanctions.
.The Committee notes the above-mentioned elements relating to the investigation undertaken by the DGES (a state authority) and the parliamentary commission. The Committee observes that in this case the parties concerned disagree with regard to the existence of an unwritten agreement between CODICEN and FENAPES under which trade union leave was reportedly justified for a number of years, beyond what was agreed in a collective agreement signed in . The Committee notes that this difference of views relates to the formalities which, according to the Government s indication, must form the basis for agreements made by the public administration, in particular the need for such agreements to be recorded in writing. The Committee also notes that the dispute concerning the existence of the agreement concerned, in which the State is one of the interested parties, was ultimately adjudicated by the authority of the sector concerned. In this regard, while taking note that the Government only recognizes the existence of the collective agreement signed in  between the CSEU and CODICEN, the Committee recalls that it has considered that in the event of conflicting interpretations of a collective agreement in the public sector, the definitive interpretation should not be that of the public administration, which would be acting as judge as well as party in the case, but rather that of an independent authority [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee, also recalling that it has drawn attention to the importance of promoting collective bargaining, as set out in Article  of Convention No. , in the education sector [see Compilation, para. ], expresses the firm hope that in future, and in line with Uruguay s tradition of social dialogue and its recognized commitment to collective bargaining, it is precisely through dialogue and bipartite collective bargaining that issues relating to trade union leave taken by secondary education teachers will be addressed and reviewed, if deemed necessary, in a climate of confidence, respect and good faith.
.Moreover, though recalling that while persons engaged in trade union activities or holding trade union office cannot claim immunity in respect of the ordinary criminal law, the arrest of, and criminal charges brought against, trade unionists may only be based on legal requirements that in themselves do not infringe the principles of freedom of association [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee requests the Government and the complainants to keep it informed of the status of the criminal complaint filed against the teacher and union leader Mr Slamovitz and other union leaders, and to provide information on the action taken by the ANEP, the Transparency and Public Ethics Board, and the Public Prosecutor s Office, to which the parliamentary commission referred the activities in question.
.The Committee notes the complainants' allegation that in  the DGES issued Decision No. , which amended the terms of a collective agreement of  between the ANEP and the Coordinating Committee of Uruguayan Teaching Unions (CSEU) regarding the use of trade union leave by the ATES by modifying the formula used to determine the number of free hours that were paid. The Committee notes the Government s indication in this regard that: (i) there were no administrative acts that properly regulated the use of union leave by the ATES and otherwise the decision merely approved the lists presented by the ATES with the maximum number of hours that could be justified for union leave; (ii) FENAPES requested the Court for Administrative Disputes (TCA) to revoke the decision and declare it null and void, and so a final ruling is still pending; and (iii) this situation is also being addressed in a tripartite collective bargaining body. Recalling that agreements should be binding on the parties [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision issued by the TCA and of any developments in the above-mentioned tripartite negotiations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure a reasonable balance between the obligation of political neutrality of public teachers in the educational field established by the Constitution of Uruguay and the right of teacher organizations to express their opinions on economic and social policy issues that may affect its members and to be able to disseminate them in the workplace bearing in mind the need not to impair the education of the children, and to take any necessary actions in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the invalidation proceedings brought in the Court for Administrative Disputes (TCA) relating to banners on the schools' facades, and also of the status of the other complaint filed by FENAPES with the INDDHH.(b) The Committee requests the Government and the complainants to keep it informed of the status of the criminal complaint filed against the teacher and union leader Mr Slamovitz and other FENAPES leaders, and to provide information on the action taken by the ANEP, the Transparency and Public Ethics Board, and the Public Prosecutor s Office, to which the parliamentary commission referred the activities in question.(c) While requesting the Government to keep it informed of any decision issued by the TCA and of any developments in the above-mentioned tripartite negotiations mentioned by the Government in relation to the ATES, the Committee expresses the firm hope that in future, in line with Uruguay s tradition of social dialogue and its recognized commitment to collective bargaining, it is precisely through dialogue and bipartite collective bargaining that issues relating to trade union leave taken by secondary education teachers will be addressed and reviewed, if deemed necessary, in a climate of confidence, respect and good faith.",1,2022,Uruguay
7,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Surgical Anaesthesia Union of Uruguay (SAQ) dated  February . The SAQ sent additional information in a communication dated  May .
.The Government provided its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  February , the SAQ states that it was formed in  when surgical anaesthetists decided to change their trade union representation, which to that point had been undertaken by the Medical Union of Uruguay (SMU), on the understanding that this union no longer represented or defended their interests. The complainant states that it is a category trade union, which represents more than , doctors and which, since its creation, has concluded countless collective agreements both in the public and private sectors. They also state that, in the country, there are three operational trade unions that represent doctors: the SMU (which represents doctors who are not surgical anaesthetists in Montevideo), the Medical Federation of the Interior (FEMI) (which organizes doctors outside Montevideo) and the SAQ (which represents surgical anaesthetists across the whole country). The complainant states that these organizations are not exclusive and that it is normal for some doctors to be members of two or three of those organizations.
.The complainant alleges that: (i) up until , they participated actively in collective bargaining, concluding countless collective health sector agreements, both within the public and private sectors; (ii) following the rise to power of the Frente Amplio Government in , there have been a series of changes in the relationship with the Government; (iii) there was a special relationship between those who had been leaders of the SMU and the new Government, to the extent that many of those in leadership positions in the SMU took up positions in the Government; and (iv) this special link has led to the fact that the Government has favoured the SMU above the other medical trade unions and has supported that union repeatedly in its intent to eliminate the existing trade union plurality in the sector.
.The complainant alleges that, since , the Government began to systematically favour the SMU as the organization that should represent all doctors in all fields of practice, and that the SMU has managed to sign agreements in which surgical anaesthesia has been reformulated without the participation of the SAQ, and even going against the wishes of that organization. In addition, the complainant alleges that the Government of that era applied pressure on and harassed the directors of the complainant organization, making statements and accusations against its officials, which were submitted to the National Medical College.
.The complainant states that, in , the Government convened the Health Advisory Councils and that, although more than  trade union and social organizations were invited with the aim of gathering their opinion regarding a reform of the national health system, the Government specifically excluded the complainant. The complainant alleges that, after presenting a grievance in that regard to the judiciary, it was finally invited to participate in those Councils. The complainant alleges that, although, during the period '  they managed to continue participating in collective bargaining in all areas, from  a process began, under which they were systematically and conscientiously excluded by the Government from every collective bargaining process, with the clear complacency of the SMU. The complainant alleges that, in , the Government and the SMU planned to reformulate doctors' way of working and remuneration, with a view to fixing a single salary for all doctors, irrespective of their specialty and any associated risks, favouring those who practised general medicine and to the detriment of those practising medical specialties. The complainant alleges that the ulterior motive of that reform was to eliminate the agreement that related specifically to surgical anaesthetists, which had been negotiated by the SAQ more than two decades previously.
.The complainant notes that the Wage Councils, tripartite collective bargaining bodies in the private sector, were relaunched in the country in , and that, although it is true that neither the SAQ nor the FEMI are formally a part of Group  (health and related services) under the Wage Councils, both were invited by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MTSS) to participate with the right to speak but without vote. The complainant demonstrates that, until , the SAQ, the FEMI and the SMU participated in Group  and, although the vote for the workers in this group was held by the SMU, which was designated by the executive authorities as the most representative trade union because of the number of its members, the SMU participated together with the other trade unions, respecting the position of the FEMI and the SAQ.
.The complainant alleges that, although the Medical Labour Commission was created in  and it was determined that a delegation designated by the SAQ was going to be able to participate when positions in the surgical anaesthesia specialty were being negotiated, in  they were excluded from the invitation to participate in the Wage Council negotiations and that the name of the Medical Labour Commission was changed to the Multipartite Advisory Commission (CMA), excluding the SAQ from the Commission. Furthermore, they allege that, in , high-availability positions (CAD) were negotiated in the specialty of general surgery, without the complainant ever being invited to participate in collective bargaining and, although at the end of  they signed an agreement that enabled them to participate in meetings of the CAM when matters relating to surgical anaesthesia were to be dealt with, the SAQ was allowed to attend but was never given the option of taking the floor.
.The complainant alleges that the SMU and the Government planned and imposed the use of high-availability positions in the private sector, establishing a system of semi-exclusivity (or complete exclusivity) in which productivity (the fundamental mechanism of remuneration for surgical anaesthetists negotiated by the SAQ) became a completely residual aspect, and in which the thing that had been an incentive before became a punishment (under which, doctors that did not meet determined goals saw their base salary reduced by up to  per cent). The complainant alleges that these positions were designed without their participation and against their express will, despite the fact that they are specifically designed for surgical anaesthetists.
.The complainant demonstrates that, as its members were denied from putting themselves forward for high-availability positions, the executive authorities required enterprises to only hire workers using this type of contract under the penalty of fines and punishments. The complainant indicates that the high-availability positions could not be implemented because the collective of surgical anaesthetists and the SAQ had spoken out against these positions and had repeatedly condemned this situation by means of labour conflicts, and as a result few or no anaesthetists or surgeons responded to the recruitment call for these positions. Faced with this situation and as their actions had not yielded any fruit, the executive authorities, in agreement with the SMU, proceeded in the  Wage Councils to take another step forward to attack the surgical anaesthetists and resolved to directly reduce their salaries through the shady and oblique method of recategorizing surgical procedures, decreasing the total salary that general surgeons received for performing surgery, that is to say, a direct wage reduction.
.In a communication sent on  May , the complainant indicates that, although it is true that the current Government, which came into power on  March , responds to different power groups than those that occupied positions in the moment that the complaint was submitted and that the special relationship that existed between the authorities of the previous Government and the SMU and the particular favouritism of the State towards the SMU no longer exist, the SAQ continues to be invited to participate in collective bargaining only to the extent that the SMU considers it to be relevant. The complainant considers that, although it was surely as a result of the change in Government that it has begun to participate in collective bargaining in the Wage Councils, to all intents and purposes, their appearance at the Wage Councils continues at the mercy of the SMU; they are not invited to those Councils by the MTSS, rather it is the SMU that invites them (usually they are invited incorrectly and late) and they are only invited to participate with the right to speak but without the right to vote except through the SMU, which does not represent or defend their interests. The complainant alleges that they have always been told, despite their opposition, that the decisions taken by the SMU and the Government are final. The complainant also considers that there is no guarantee that the SMU would not decide from one day to the next to prevent them from participating in",0,2021,Uruguay
8,"the Wage Councils.
.The complainant alleges that: (i) the state health enterprise known as the State Health Services Administration (ASSE), with which, historically, multiple agreements had been negotiated, excluded them from the negotiations in which high-availability roles (FAD) for surgical anaesthetists were approved; and (ii) in , collective bargaining agreements were signed with the SMU through which those roles were implemented for general surgeons and surgical anaesthetists working in the ASSE, modifying agreements concluded between the ASSE and the SAQ in , which is to say that a collective bargaining agreement that was in force was violated in a unilateral and illegal manner. The complainant alleges that the SMU acts primarily in the defence of doctors that are not surgical anaesthetists (and of those, not even in defence of doctors from the interior of the country), and does not act in defence of anaesthetists.
.The complainant states that they have presented requests for annulment to the Administrative Court (TCA) against the resolutions of the ASSE, which were used to approve the collective bargaining agreements with the SMU that implemented the high-availability positions in general surgery and surgical anaesthesia, since those agreements were to the detriment of the working conditions of those doctors and were approved without their participation. The complainant indicates that the TCA has not yet issued a judgment on those requests for annulment.
.The complainant states that the designation of the most representative organization is not determined by an independent body that guarantees the necessary impartiality, but rather that it is the executive authorities that designate the most representative organization for each sector in the groups identified by the Wage Councils. According to the information provided by the complainant, in the case of the Group  Wage Council, relating to the health sector, the SMU was designated as the most representative organization for doctors, despite the fact that it lacked the necessary independence from the Government.
.The complainant states that, given that they had been excluded from Group  and that the representation of medical workers in that group had been granted to the SMU as the most representative organization, they had posed the possibility of creating a surgical anaesthesia subgroup within Group  that would be made up of the same delegations of the main group, but would also include ' given the existence of an additional place ' a delegate of the SAQ, and it would be in that environment that any matter relating to the categories, salaries and working conditions of surgical anaesthetists and surgeons should be discussed and resolved. The complainant states that similar solutions have been implemented in other sectors of activity, in which, in the face of the existence of a trade union for a profession, subgroups or chapters have been favoured in which decisions can be negotiated that encompass all the enterprises of the sector covering specific jobs or tasks. That is the case, for example, in Group  (transport) where Subgroup  (air transport) was created, in which there are multiple chapters that deal with matters relating to national and foreign companies, but also the various professions involved (airline pilots, pilots of aerial application aircraft, ground staff, etc.), providing each group with their own environment in which negotiation can take place, in which the floor is given to specific trade unions that represent the workers. The complainant states that the executive authorities have refused to create a subgroup within Group  with an area of operation limited to surgical anaesthetists, which would have removed all of the problems relating to the representativeness of the SMU, as that subgroup would have enabled the SAQ to participate and represent its workers as the workers' organization that is undeniably the most representative of surgical anaesthetists.
.The complainant states that: (i) the Wage Councils are tripartite and the majority of votes are cast by the executive authorities such that it can occur and it has occurred that workers or employers do not agree with a proposal, and in the end the proposal is approved against their will because of the votes cast by the Government; (ii) there is a type of compulsory arbitration which follows the best of hypotheses and guidance provided by the executive authorities in the most serious cases, but in addition to this general violation, which the law limits to minimum wage and categories of activity, this interference in the health sector has been great and exceeds even the scope of the law itself, as, in essence, collective bargaining has been brought under control, subjecting it to the health policy that the executive authorities intends to implement, and (iii) the Government has incessantly intervened and promoted aspects that go beyond minimum wages and categories, constantly getting involved in aspects that are set in accordance with national regulations resulting from bipartite collective bargaining, violating the principles of bilateralism and of free and voluntary negotiation.
.The complainant alleges that the executive authorities have been making proposals that modify working conditions and remuneration for workers, an area which should be the sole responsibility of the workers' and employers' organizations involved and alleges that this has been particularly evident in two areas in which the executive authorities have intervened in collective bargaining:
.The complainant states that: (i) following intense efforts, they were finally permitted to attend the  Recategorization Committee' to  accompany' the SMU, but without the right to speak, that is to say, to attend as a simple observer; (ii) in the end, only two meetings of the Committee were held, in which it was clear that the recategorization had already been agreed between the State and the SMU; (iii) in the final meeting, and in spite of their negative opinion regarding signing the recategorization of surgical anaesthetic procedures, which would lead to a wage reduction, the SMU unilaterally approved the document; and (iv) the severity of the situation lies not only in the direct wage reduction, but also in the fact that the wage reduction was formally proposed (and to a certain extent, imposed) by the executive authorities, violating the principle of bilateral collective bargaining by the Government making a direct intervention to modify the form of remuneration of workers in the enterprises in question.
.The complainant states that in the last decade, various disputes have occurred, many of them related to the question of representativeness, and alleges that, in the disputes of  and  (among others), the work of surgical anaesthetists was declared to be essential, without the necessary budget being provided for that work. The complainant alleges that: (i) the essential nature of work did not only affect emergency services but also any surgery or other activity carried out at the polyclinic, such as the coordinated care provided in outpatient clinics, and considers that the way in which the designation was used was a way of removing the right to strike; and (ii) the declaration of essential work was used as a way of bringing an end to the dispute without proposing mechanisms for arbitration or alternative mediation, they simply prohibited strike action and prevented the trade union from being able to act to pursue its demands. The complainant indicates that, although the law provides for work to be declared essential, that covers essential (minimal) services and not all activity and that those services should be  maintained through emergency shifts'  the executive authorities disregarded this by declaring essential all work carried out by surgical anaesthetists (including, for example, normal polyclinics).
.In the light of the above, the complainant asks: (i) whether it is valid to declare work essential when there is continuity of care provided by the trade union presence in accordance with a duty roster, which is guaranteed by the trade union and regarding the existence of which there is no controversy; (ii) whether it is valid that the declaration of work as essential and the prohibition against taking trade union action should encompass surgery in all its forms, including care in polyclinics, coordinated care, etc., as it has been used and not only to encompass those services which are, owing to their nature, truly essential; and (iii) whether it is valid to prohibit the exercise of the right to strike without offering any other alternative method for solving the dispute or to discuss the set of demands issued by the trade union.
.The complainant states that, according to Decree No. / of  August , the agreement was reached in the Group  Wage Council, Health Services, to create the Continuing Medical Education Fund, to which contributions would be made by enterprises, and they allege that the MTSS only transferred funds to the SMU and that the SAQ never received such funds. The complainant also states that in , they initiated legal proceedings against the MTSS, reclaiming the payment of the amount that, in their understanding, should have been transferred by the institutions concerned, in compliance with the  agreement, and that had never been paid to the complainant. According to the complainant s statement, in the agreements reached under the framework of the Wage",0,2021,Uruguay
9,"Councils, it had been agreed that those funds should have been transferred directly to the SAQ and not to the SMU. The legal proceedings are ongoing.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that, in the country, there is complete trade union freedom and independence, which includes a system of collective bargaining with a long history and that Uruguay was one of the first countries to accept, promote and protect not only collective bargaining, but also the other two pillars of collective labour rights, the right to strike and freedom of association. In addition, it highlights that the legal system in Uruguay is characterized by trade union pluralism, and that, as a result, the collective rights to organize and to collective bargaining are granted to all established collective organizations.
.With regard to the alleged relationship between the Government authorities and the SMU leadership, and the resulting lack of independence of the latter, the Government highlights that, since  March , the political leadership of the State has been in the hands of different political parties than those that had been leading the country during the facts that have been included in the complaint. The Government states, however, that the design of the representation of labour interests by the Wage Councils and the remuneration structure and working conditions agreed under those Councils have not been modified, and therefore the assertion of the supposed intention to favour the other trade union organization through a supposed preference towards that institution is unfounded. The Government states that, at the current time, the SAQ has been participating in collective bargaining that has been formally convened under the Wage Councils, participation which is not the result of an invitation issued by the MTSS but rather by the SMU, and that it participates with the right to speak but without vote. With regard to the assessments made by the SAQ regarding the State s intention to reformulate the form of medical practice and its remuneration in order to favour those practising general medicine over those practising other specialties, as well as to generate a single agreement for the sector, the Government highlights that, unlike in other countries, in Uruguay, in addition to the coexistence of the private and public subsectors of health, the financing of comprehensive healthcare providers that provide health coverage for the population is almost entirely public, as there is a joint fund composed of contributions from workers, enterprises and the State, as well as a direct allocation from the national budget. For this reason, the way in which healthcare spending is implemented by healthcare providers is a relevant variable, both for the Ministry of Public Health (MSP) and for the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), in order to guarantee the efficiency of the system and ensure quality universal health coverage for the population. In this regard, collective bargaining is a relevant space to establish public human resources policies, which, furthermore, are developed in agreement with the main actors in the sector. The Government states that neither the MEF nor the MSP formally participate in the Wage Councils, as, during the tripartite collective bargaining carried out under their framework, the executive authorities are represented by the MTSS, therefore, the invitation and participation of the MSP is to provide oversight and advice.
.Notwithstanding the above, the Government highlights that the reform of medical practice was carried out through a long process of negotiation in which, at every opportunity, there was consensus between the parties that were participating in the collective bargaining, representatives that were not nominated arbitrarily, but rather in accordance with the criteria of representativeness established by legal regulations, over which the MSP does not have any influence. Furthermore, it emphasizes that all the reports that form part of the new medical agreement, which was agreed within the framework of the Wage Councils, were signed by all the delegations, thus indicating that there is consensus among all participants.
.The Government indicates that the SAQ has participated in discussions that took place in committees that operate under the framework of the MSP and that it was in those committees that the new medical practice regime was agreed, and highlights the following instances of collective bargaining: (i) from  to , the Medical Labour Commission was operational, which was part of the Group  Wage Council and in which it was established when matters relating to a specialty would be discussed, the representative of the SMU would attend with a representative of the Commission and in the case of the surgical anaesthesiology specialty, the representative should be appointed by the SAQ, and (ii) from  to  the Multipartite Advisory Commission (CAM) was operational, coordinated by the MSP, with the participation of the executive authorities and the SMU and the wide participation of institutions from within the sector, with the goal of monitoring changes that were established by the agreement signed by the Wage Councils that took place on  November . The Commission drew up proposals that were subsequently the subject of discussion and approval by the Wage Councils and, in those meetings, proposals were agreed to reform all medical specialties, in particular those relating to surgical anaesthesia; in  a proposal for high-availability positions in general surgery was drawn up, and the SAQ participated in various meetings during the preparation of that proposal, but the final wording was not shared. For that reason Report No.  of the CAM, which the rest of the parties had signed, included a clause that would allow the discussion to be continued for six months following the agreement. The Government states that the continuing discussion referred to above took place in the MTSS, and members of Group , the Uruguayan Society of Surgery and the SAQ participated therein. The Government therefore considers that it is not true that the SAQ was not allowed to participate in the process of determining the working conditions that could affect workers in the specialties that it represents.
.The Government states that during all these years, the State Health Services Administration (ASSE), a state enterprise, listened to the SAQ and that, in May , the three medical trade unions signed a framework agreement with the ASSE that establishes the bases for the remuneration of medical positions within that enterprise. That agreement also established a monitoring committee, as a result of which multiple reports were issued that reflected bipartite agreements to implement what had been agreed in the framework agreement. The Government adds that, for the ASSE, it has been fundamental to try and retain and incentivize the professionals working in the enterprise, and, in that regard, the introduction of the high-availability positions (negotiated for the private sector by the Wage Councils) opened up the possibility for the ASSE to contract new members of staff in certain specialties, where the competence in some specialties that are considered to be critical was determined by the value that each institution was able to pay. The Government states that, in this way, it was understood that the environment for discussing the high-availability roles should be a mirror of the environment in which the high-availability positions were discussed by the Group  Wage Council, for which a CAM had been established in the public sector. The Government explains that the high-availability roles only changed the work model, they are not compulsory, they require a public call and that in recent years there have been many instances in which they were discussed with representatives of the SAQ, and several of the proposals made by SAQ representatives were included in the agreements that were signed. Furthermore, on  September , when the MSP requested the MTSS to convene the public sector CAM to discuss the high-availability roles in anaesthesiology, the SMU noted on the record that it had invited the Society of Anaesthesiology and the SAQ, but that these associations had indicated in writing that they would not be attending the meeting.
.The Government states that, although the ASSE receives all trade unions that request meetings in order to enter into dialogue, receive proposals and provide information in accordance with current national and international regulations for the purposes of collective bargaining and signing agreements, it only holds meetings with the most representative trade union organization. The Government understands that the proposal of the SAQ refers to difficulties in the relationships between trade unions in which the ASSE cannot, and should not, interfere. The Government also states that, although the SAQ has initiated legal proceedings to annul agreements signed by the ASSE with the purpose of implementing the high-availability roles on the grounds of the harm that these types of roles cause for its workers, those roles do not harm any of the rights that surgical anaesthetists working in the ASSE currently hold. In all cases, there is an economic benefit for all those who put themselves forward for those positions. The high-availability roles only change the work model, they are not compulsory and they require a public call. The Government states in addition",0,2021,Uruguay
10,"that according to a resolution issued by the SAQ assembly dated  November , it instructed its members not to put themselves forward for high-availability roles made available by the ASSE and indicated that it would punish any members that did so; warning that the punishment could even lead to the suspension of membership, for those who took up the position for which they had put themselves forward.
.The Government states that through greater representativeness, it is possible to reconcile trade union plurality with the need to have single representation for certain actions, while highlighting that the determination of the most representative organization is only required when there is no agreement between the various trade union organizations that represent the workforce, thus making it possible that it is the organizations themselves that define the matter, consolidating their platforms and their demands, agreeing on strategies, etc. Where an agreement does not exist, once it has been determined which is the most representative organization on the basis of the objective criteria (independence, as proposed by the SAQ, but also the age of the union, continuity of operation and number of members) provided for in article  of Law No.  (the law which establishes the fundamental principles and rights of the collective bargaining system), that determination confers a legal status on the union that benefits it to a certain extent, without that implying any denial of the rights possessed by the rest of the trade unions, which are inherent in the idea of freedom of association.
.The Government states that, in the current legal framework, the most representative organization has the following prerogatives: (i) to appoint non-governmental representatives to the ILO; (ii) to form part of the Superior Council for Collective Bargaining in the Public Sector and the Superior Tripartite Council (the body that coordinates and governs the system of labour relations and which comprises six delegates from the executive authorities, six delegates from the most representative employers' organizations and six delegates from the most representative workers' organizations, and which is responsible for classifying tripartite groups for collective bargaining by branch of activity or production chain and designates the negotiating organizations in each area); (iii) to form part of the Wage Councils and negotiation at the branch level in the public sector, because it is the most representative organizations in each sector that form part of the Wage Council for that sector, and the topics to be discussed in those Councils, such as, among others, the creation of subgroups, trade union licences, categories, wages, etc., should be proposed by those organizations; and (iv) to negotiate and conclude general collective agreements at the branch or enterprise level or with a public or private sector body. The Government states that, on the basis of the provisions set out in article  of Law No. , the privilege of the most representative organization refers both to the signing of the agreement as well as to the exclusive representation of workers in the collective bargaining process, and as such does not infringe upon the right to trade union plurality.
.The Government states that on  October , the SAQ presented a statement requesting that Group  should vote on the formation of a subgroup to cover the activities carried out by surgical anaesthetists and that that statement gave rise to MTSS File No. ---, as a result of which, the Group  Wage Council met on  November , stating among other things that, in accordance with applicable regulations, all groups of activity, as well as subgroups, should refer to a branch of activity or production chain, and for that reason it did not consider it to be appropriate to create subgroups for professions or roles. The Government has attached a copy of the report produced by the delegates appointed by the executive authorities to the Group  Wage Council, which indicates, among other things, that the classification of the various Wage Councils is carried out on the basis of a branch of activity or production chain; in the case of Group  the branch of activity covers:  Health and related services. Hospitals, sanatoriums. Collective medical care institutions (mutual societies, medical cooperatives, trade union care centres). Private medical care institutions with full or partial coverage, clinical analysis laboratories, medical clinics, dialysis. Mobile emergency services. Rehabilitation centres. Care services, health centres, homes for the elderly, fitness clinics that provide medical services and services for doctors. Dental services (including dental products, prosthesis and dental clinics). Clinics and laboratories that provide veterinary analysis services'  In that report, it states that, although Law No.  provides for the creation by the Wage Councils of  special or expert subcouncils' in order to facilitate the study of or research into a particular problem, the subgroups should correspond to one of the areas indicated, or if that is not the case, should be related to a production chain.
.The Government considers that the existence of a subgroup related to the work of surgical anaesthetists would not on its own resolve the dispute concerning representation that exists in the sector, given that it is the delegation of the group that designates the representatives for the subgroups. The Government states that the way in which the delegates are elected to the Wage Councils is explicitly provided for in article  of Law No.  and in article  of Law No.  and that it is the Superior Tripartite Council that designates the employers' and workers' organizations that will participate in each area; these organizations communicate the appointed delegates to the executive authorities. The Government explains that the delegates for subgroups are appointed by the representatives of the main group and that they act as advisers to the main delegation. The Superior Tripartite Council does not appoint the negotiating organizations for the subgroups, rather, it only refers to the most representative organizations of each group of activity.
.The Government mentions that, in general, it has understood that, where there is more than one professional organization in a given area, the first alternative is an inter-union agreement between the various organizations, which allows for their joint attendance at the negotiations. The Government states that there is no unanimous agreement concerning which should be the competent body to determine the most representative organization at the enterprise or institutional level in cases where that is under debate, and that there are various positions that could be taken in that regard:
.As the Government states, the National Labour Directorate would have indicated that the fact that a determination made by the MTSS constituted an act of interference in the trade union organizations, contrary to the provisions of Convention No. , and for that reason, disputes related to representativeness should, in the first instance, be dealt with through dialogue and the trade unions themselves reaching an agreement on the composition of representation, emphasizing that the delegation from the executive authorities has always collaborated in that regard, always in its role of providing mediation and conciliation, as it has done on several occasions.
.The Government highlights that: (i) negotiation has always been carried out together with all the trade union organizations that have representation at the Council level throughout the whole process, and that this arises from a single agreement, signed on  October , which contains aspects relating to general salaries for medical and non-medical workers and in which it was agreed that a committee should be created to update the categories for the classification of surgical interventions, with the participation of SMU delegates, accompanied by the FEMI and a delegate of the SAQ; (ii) this negotiation provided for the participation of the SAQ and was created with the aim of  reviewing the classification of surgical anaesthesia interventions in the current categories, as well as the eventual creation of new categories, including the review of the current table and the incorporation of interventions that are not included in the table'  and (iii) another of the objectives of this negotiation was to define the modifications to be made as of January  to the surgical anaesthesia variable according to the general adjustment chart provided for in the general agreement, (fourth clause of the Agreement of  October  (general part)); this negotiation was responsible for covering  the activities carried out by doctors trained in surgical anaesthesia specialties' as proposed by the SAQ.
.The Government states that: (i) according to the information provided by the delegates of Group , between  and  the SAQ continued to participate, without signature, in various negotiations (the Government mentions these negotiations in its reply); (ii) since , there were new avenues for the SAQ to participate in tripartite collective bargaining and in the Wage Councils; and (iii) meetings have been held under the auspices of the Collective Bargaining Division with various enterprises in the health sector.
.The Government states that Law No.  created the tripartite Wage Councils with the fundamental goal of establishing a minimum wage for each category in each branch or sector of activity and",0,2021,Uruguay
11,"that, in this regard, it is logical that the sectoral wage policy is aligned with the goals of the National Integrated Health System, the implementation of which is the responsibility of the MSP. The Government states that it does not share the statement made by the complainant that the design of the high-availability positions prevents a worker from holding more than one job, reduce incentives to work and to specialize and affect their technical independence. In addition, they state that compulsory exclusivity was not stipulated in any case and that these positions were designed from the perspective of healthcare services in order to improve the quality of care and patient safety. The Government highlights the fact that the high-availability positions, agreed by the Wage Councils, do not affect the rights acquired by health professionals who had other wage agreements that they could consider more beneficial and that they only apply to contracts that had already been signed, in cases where there was an agreement between the worker and the employer. In addition, it highlights that there is no legal restriction preventing a private health services provider from agreeing, individually or through bilateral negotiation at the lower level of negotiation, wage conditions that are more beneficial than those agreed by the Wage Councils; therefore, the Government denies the existence of coercive activity on the part of the State towards private service providers to prevent them from negotiating the above-mentioned conditions with the SAQ. The Government states that the criminal justice system has not processed any complaint that involves threats or violence by members of the executive authorities towards healthcare providers.
.With regard to the recategorization of surgical procedures, the Government states that the discussion regarding the review of the categories for the classification of surgical interventions took place in the Wage Councils, which agreed to create a working committee for the recategorization of surgical procedures, which would be attended by the MSP, the MEF and the SMU (which would be accompanied by a representative of the FEMI and a delegate of the SAQ). The Government states that, in the report dated  March  of that committee, the new categories of surgical interventions were defined for general surgery, which required a change in the structure such that some interventions increased in value and others decreased. It also states that the goal of the recategorization was to incorporate procedures that were not provided for in the previous agreement, recognizing the changes that have occurred, as a result of technological advancements, in the various procedures that had already been agreed. The Government highlights that the Society of Surgery of Uruguay, which is part of the SAQ, actively participated in the whole negotiation process and attaches a copy of the note issued by that Society analysing the recategorization proposal.
.The Government states that traditionally, as there is no legal definition in the legal system of the concept of essential service, the MTSS has a certain amount of discretion when establishing the essential nature of work, with the resulting need to maintain services through emergency shifts, the interruption of which determines that a strike or lock-out is illegal, according to the provisions of article  of Law No. . The Government considers, in this regard, that the innate essential nature of medical activity in certain cases is not debatable, and therefore, it is necessary to maintain, as close to normal as possible, hospital care in in-patient, urgent and emergency services, highlighting that the Administrative Court (TAC) has not declared the annulment of any other rulings of the executive authorities that have declared medical services to be essential.
.The Government states that: (i) in , the SAQ initiated legal proceedings against the MTSS, in which they requested the payment of the amount that, in their understanding, should have been paid to them in compliance with an agreement concluded in , in which the Continuing Medical Education Fund was created; and (ii) on  September , ruling No. / was issued, which dismissed all the terms of the proceedings, since the SAQ had recognized that the funds were in the possession of the SMU, which is the organization that had represented them in the signing of the agreement, and that the MTSS had complied with the assumed commitment and that it did not possess any amount of the money that belonged to the SAQ.
.The Committee observes that, in the current complaint, the complainant, which represents surgical anaesthetists, alleges favouritism on the part of the Government towards another trade union, exclusion from instances of collective bargaining, interference of the Government in instances of bipartite collective bargaining, as well as aspects relating to the declaration of essential services. The Committee takes note of the fact that the Government provides replies to these allegations and that it states that, in the country, there is complete trade union freedom and independence and that it has a system of collective bargaining with a long history.
.The Committee takes note that, although in its complaint the complainant alleges that since , and in particular since , the Government exerted pressure and harassed the union and excluded it and marginalized it in every instance of collective bargaining, favouring the SMU, with whom it had a special relationship, in a later communication it indicates that the current Government, in power since  March , responds to other groups of power that are different from those that were occupying positions in the moment in which the complaint was submitted, and that the special favouritism towards the SMU no longer exists. The Committee takes note that, in that regard, the Government states that, although, since  March , the political leadership of the State has been in the hands of different political parties than those that had been leading the country during the facts that formed the basis of the complaint, the design of the representation in the Wage Councils and what was agreed by those Councils has not been changed, leaving the allegation of favouritism towards the SMU unfounded. The Committee takes due note of the information provided by the Government. While recalling that any favourable or unfavourable treatment by the public authorities of a particular trade union as compared with others, if it is not based on objective pre-established criteria of representativeness and goes beyond certain preferential rights related to collective bargaining and consultation, would constitute an act of discrimination which might jeopardize the right of workers to establish and join organizations of their own choosing [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ], the Committee notes that the complainant states that at the current time, the alleged anti-union discrimination against the SAQ and the favouritism towards the SMU no longer exists and will therefore not pursue its examination of this aspect of the complaint.
.The Committee takes note that the complainant alleges that: (i) to date, it continues at the mercy of the SMU with regard to its participation in the Wage Councils; (ii) participates with the right to speak but without vote through the SMU, which does not represent nor defend its interests; and (iii) there is no guarantee that, tomorrow, the SMU will not stop allowing its participation in the Councils. In addition, it alleges that the executive authorities designate which is the most representative organization in the Wage Council groups when an independent third party should do that, and that the authorities have refused to create a subgroup within Council Group  (Health and related services) for surgical anaesthetists, which would eliminate the problems of representation, despite the fact that there are subgroups in other branches of activity.
.The Committee takes note that, in that regard, the Government states that: (i) since , the SAQ has been invited to the Councils by the SMU and has participated with the right to speak but without vote; (ii) the Wage Councils are made up of the most representative organizations, which negotiate and sign collective agreements erga omnes; (iii) there is no legal restriction preventing private healthcare providers from agreeing, individually or through bilateral negotiation at the lower level of negotiation, wage conditions that are more beneficial than those agreed by the Wage Councils; (iv) the Superior Tripartite Council, composed of the executive authorities and the most representative organizations, is the body that designates the organizations that participate in the Wage Councils; (v) the privilege of the most representative organization refers to the signature of agreements as well as representation in the negotiation, not violating trade union plurality; (vi) the determination of the most representative trade union is only required when there is no agreement between trade union organizations, making it possible for the organizations themselves to determine the matter; (vii) where there is no agreement, the legitimacy to negotiate is granted to the most representative organization in accordance with the criteria provided for in article  of Law No.  (age of union, number of members ' ; (viii) there is no unanimous agreement with regard to which body should be",0,2021,Uruguay
12,"the competent body to determine which is the most representative organization at the enterprise or institutional level in cases where that is under debate and that the disputes relating to representativeness should first be addressed by means of dialogue, and that the executive authorities have always collaborated by providing mediation; (ix) the SAQ has taken the floor in various meetings of Group  and in some of those meetings decided not to sign the records of those meetings; and (x) in , Group  considered the possibility of creating subgroups and concluded that it was not appropriate to open subgroups for professions or roles.
.The Committee observes that: (i) article  of the Law on Collective Bargaining in the Private Sector, No. , establishes that collective bargaining at the level of branch of activity or production chain can be carried out either through the Wage Councils or through bipartite collective bargaining; (ii) the negotiation of working conditions for surgical anaesthetists by the Wage Councils forms part of a wider negotiation environment, which encompasses all medical specialties and for which the negotiating agent is, currently, the SMU; and (iii) according to the Government, there would be no legal restriction preventing the complainant from agreeing, through bilateral collective bargaining with private healthcare providers, working conditions that are more beneficial than the conditions agreed by the Wage Councils. The Committee also observes that, although the Government assures that, since , the SAQ has been invited by the SMU and has participated in the Group  Wage Council with the right to speak but without vote, the complainant alleges that the SMU does not represent nor defend its interests and that there is no guarantee that it will allow them to continue to participate in the Councils.
.The Committee recalls, in this regard, that systems based on a sole bargaining agent (the most representative) and those which include all organizations or the most representative organizations in accordance with clear pre-established criteria for the determination of the organizations entitled to negotiate are both compatible with Convention No. . It also recalls that the granting of exclusive rights to the most representative organization should not mean that the existence of other unions to which certain involved workers might wish to belong is prohibited; in addition, minority organizations should be permitted to carry out their activities and at least to have the right to speak on behalf of their members and to represent them. On the other hand, the Committee has considered that in order to determine whether an organization has the capacity to be the sole signatory to collective agreements, two criteria should be applied: representativeness and independence. According to the Committee, the determination of which organizations meet these criteria should be carried out by a body offering every guarantee of independence and objectivity [see Compilation paras ,  and ].
.Taking into account that Law No.  establishes that the collaboration and consultation are fundamental principles and rights of the collective bargaining system and emphasizes the promotion of mutual understanding and good relations between the organizations themselves, the Committee trusts that, within the framework of the collective bargaining system currently in operation in the country, the SAQ will continue having the opportunity to express its opinions in the meetings that concern it. In addition, recognizing the independence that workers' and employers' organizations enjoy in the country to define their representatives in collective bargaining processes, the Committee requests that the Government should take the necessary measures, in full consultation with the social partners, to ensure that, if there is no agreement between the parties concerned, the determination of the most representative employers' or workers' organization is not left to the discretion of the Government, but rather to a body that offers every guarantee of independence and objectivity. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Committee takes note that the complainant alleges that in , the ASSE signed collective agreements with the SMU, through which the high-availability roles were implemented in surgical anaesthesia specialties and that those roles modified agreements that the SAQ had concluded with the ASSE in , violating in a unilateral and illegal manner a collective bargaining agreement that had been in force. The SAQ has introduced actions before the TCA to annul the ASSE resolutions, through which collective agreements were approved between the ASSE and the SMU in general surgery and surgical anaesthesia which harmed their working conditions and were approved without its participation.
.The Committee takes note that, in that regard, the Government states that: (i) although the ASSE receives all trade unions that request meetings in order to enter into dialogue and conduct collective bargaining and sign agreements, it holds some meetings only with the most representative trade union; (ii) in May , the three medical trade unions signed a framework agreement with the ASSE, which establishes the bases for the remuneration of medical positions in the ASSE and that agreement established a monitoring committee, as a result of which, multiple reports were issued that reflected bipartite agreements to implement what had been agreed in the framework agreement; and (iii) there are difficulties in the relationship between trade unions in which the ASSE cannot, nor should not interfere.
.The Committee observes that, according to publicly available information, in December  and April  the TCA handed down rulings relating to the demands submitted by the SAQ which ruled in favour of that union, annulling the ASSE resolutions that standardized agreements signed between the ASSE and the SMU in  and  in which the high-availability positions were implemented for general surgeons, anaesthetists and gynaecologists who worked in the ASSE. The Committee observes that, in those rulings, the TCA indicated that the agreements between the ASSE and the SMU had changed the working conditions decided upon in previous agreements between the ASSE and the SAQ, disregarding the salary increases agreed therein.
.The Committee recalls, as mentioned before, that systems of collective bargaining with exclusive rights for the most representative trade union and those where it is possible for a number of collective agreements to be concluded by a number of trade unions within a company are both compatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee also recalls that mutual respect for the commitment undertaken in collective agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground [see Compilation, paras  and ]. Observing that the rulings of the TCA return the situation to its previous state and stipulate that, in order to comply with the rulings, they should establish the bases for a negotiation between the ASSE and the SAQ, the Committee trusts that the negotiations will be conducted in a harmonious manner.
.The Committee takes note that the complainant alleges that the executive authorities have violated the principle of bilateral collective bargaining and the principle of free and voluntary negotiation, because it has made proposals that modify the working and wage conditions of the workers, an area that, in its opinion, should be exclusively the responsibility of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee takes note that the complainant alleges that: (i) the high-availability positions, designed by the executive authorities and the SMU against its will, reformulated the work of surgical anaesthetists, getting involved in aspects that go beyond minimum wage and wage categories and economically punishing the health institutions that do not contract doctors using that mode of employment; and (ii) the executive authorities have interfered in the recategorization of surgical procedures, which is nothing more than a hidden wage decrease, because it has an impact on the remuneration of surgical anaesthetists; and although, following intensive negotiations, the complainant was allowed to attend the recategorization committee accompanied by the SMU, they did not have the right to speak.
.In that regard, the Committee takes note that the Government states that: (i) the financing of comprehensive healthcare providers that provide health coverage for the population is almost entirely public and therefore the way in which spending in healthcare is implemented by healthcare providers is a relevant variable for the purposes of guaranteeing the efficiency of the system and ensuring quality universal health coverage; and (ii) collective bargaining is a relevant environment to establish public human resources policies that are developed in agreement with the main actors in the sector. It also states that: (i) private healthcare providers can agree, individually or through bilateral negotiation, on more beneficial wage conditions than those agreed by the Wage Councils, therefore, the Government denies the existence of coercive activity on the part of the State towards private service providers to prevent them from negotiating the above-mentioned conditions with the SAQ; (ii) the SAQ participated in discussions in which proposals were drawn up for the high-availability positions, designed from the perspective of healthcare services in order to improve the quality of care and patient safety and which do not affect the rights acquired through more beneficial wage agreements; and (iii) the recategorization",0,2021,Uruguay
13,"of surgical procedures took place in the Wage Councils in the framework of a committee in which the SMU was accompanied by a delegate from the SAQ.
.The Committee recalls that, in a previous case relating to Uruguay, it indicated that, although the fixing of minimum wages can be the object of tripartite decisions, Article  of Convention No.  encourages the promotion of bipartite negotiation to fix working conditions, for which any collective agreement on fixing employment conditions should be the result of an agreement between employers or employers' organizations on the one hand and workers' organizations on the other hand [see th Report, Case No. , para. ]. The Committee recalls that the monitoring of legislative aspects in that case was referred to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and that, since then, this question has been being examined by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations within the framework of the application of Convention No. .
.The Committee takes note that the complainant alleges that in the last decade various disputes have occurred and that there has been an irregular and abusive use of the mechanism for declaring an essential service given that, in the disputes of  and  (among others), the work of surgical anaesthetists was declared to be essential in its totality (including, for example, normal polyclinics), without having proposed alternative mechanisms for solving the disputes. In that regard, the Committee takes note that the Government states that, as there is no legal definition in the legal system of the concept of essential service, the MTSS enjoys a certain amount of discretion when establishing the essential nature of work, with the resulting need to maintain services through emergency shifts, the interruption of which determines that a strike or lock-out is illegal. It also indicates that the TCA has not annulled any ruling relating to the declaration of the essential nature of medical service. Recalling that the hospital sector can be considered to be an essential service and that the Committee has acknowledged that the right to strike can be restricted or even prohibited in the public service or in essential services in so far as a strike there could cause serious hardship to the national community and provided that the limitations are accompanied by certain compensatory guarantees [see Compilation, paras  and ], the Committee trusts that the Government will ensure that these workers are provided the necessary compensatory guarantees.
.The Committee takes note that, according to the information provided by the Government, on  September  ruling No. / was issued which dismissed the claim presented by the SAQ against the MTSS in relation to the funds that, according to the allegations, had been deposited with the SMU but not the SAQ. The Committee takes note that, in that ruling, it indicated that the SAQ had confirmed that the MTSS had transferred the entirety of the funds deposited by the enterprises to the SMU; as a result it concluded that the MTSS did not possess the quantity of money that belonged to the SAQ. The Committee takes due note of the ruling and recalls that a situation that does not involve any dispute between the Government and the trade union organizations, but rather involves a conflict within the trade union movement itself, is the sole responsibility of the interested parties themselves [see Compilation, para. ].
.Lastly, and in general terms, trusting that the adoption of the above-mentioned measures, in consultation with the social partners, will contribute to maintaining the efficient promotion of collective bargaining in the country, the Committee reminds the Government that the technical support of the Office is at its disposal.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee trusts that, in the framework of collective labour relations in force in the country, the SAQ will continue having the opportunity to express its opinions in the instances that concern it.(b) The Committee requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures, in full consultation with the social partners, to ensure that, in case of a lack of agreement between the parties concerned, the determination of the most representative employers' or workers' organization is not left to the discretion of the Government but rather to a body that offers all the guarantees of independence and objectivity. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) The Committee trusts that negotiations between the SAQ and the ASSE will be carried out in a harmonious manner.(d) The Committee trusts that, should restrictions be imposed on the right to strike in anaesthetic and surgical activities, the Government will ensure that these workers are provided the necessary compensatory guarantees.(e) Trusting that the adoption of the above-mentioned measures, in consultation with the social partners, will contribute to maintaining the effective promotion of collective bargaining in the country, the Committee reminds the Government that the technical support provided by the Office is at its disposal.",0,2021,Uruguay

.In a communication dated  November , the complainants allege that the absorption into the National Integrated Health System (SNIS) of tobacco workers who were covered by a special health insurance scheme under a collective agreement constitutes interference with the exercise of the right to bargain collectively and a violation of Convention No. . Specifically, they state that: (i) since , the SAT has had a health insurance scheme pursuant to a collective agreement; (ii) not only does this scheme meet the legal requirements for health benefits, but many of its benefits are better than those required by law since the numerous medical services offered to tobacco workers are totally free of charge; (iii) through Act No.  of  December , the Uruguayan Government established the SNIS, mandated the absorption into this system of conventional emergency and insurance schemes and empowered the executive branch to accord the same treatment to workers covered by schemes established through collective agreements; (iv) in a decree of  January , the executive branch ordered the absorption into the SNIS of workers covered by the collective agreement that had established the health service for tobacco workers; (v) by Decree No. / of  December , the executive branch postponed this absorption until  January ; (vi) Act No.  does not require the absorption of tobacco workers into the SNIS; section  thereof merely empowers the executive branch to undertake such absorption where expedient; (vii) the continued existence of private health-care entities that are not absorbed into the SNIS is not incompatible with the aforementioned Act s goal of universal coverage, nor does it hinder the functioning of the integration scheme implemented pursuant to it; and (viii) the argument that it is expedient to absorb tobacco workers into the SNIS is invalid since the costs of their specific health-care system are fully covered by contributions from the industry s employers.
.In communications dated  January,  February and  May , the SAT, relying on the legal opinion of a noted Uruguayan professor of labour and social security law, maintains that: (i) the tobacco workers' conventional health-care system is egalitarian for all workers in the industry, whether in service or retired; (ii) conventional health benefits have an obvious advantage in terms of tobacco workers' conditions of employment and wages because they entitle the workers to excellent health benefits at no cost; (iii) by contrast, the SNIS requires workers to pay contributions and offers a lower standard of medical care; (iv) Decree No. / of  December , which postponed the tobacco workers' absorption into the SNIS until  January , recognizes that health benefits established in a collective agreement are a form of wage; (v) absorption into the SNIS would therefore be seriously detrimental to tobacco workers in two ways: their health benefits would be of lower quality and their wages would be reduced in so far as they would have to cover a portion of their medical expenses; (vi) attempted tacit abolition of a more beneficial scheme resulting from collective bargaining constitutes an act of state interference since intervention by the legislative or administrative authorities that results in repeal or modification of the provisions of freely agreed collective agreements is contrary to the principle of voluntary collective bargaining; (vii) the law may not modify more advantageous working conditions in peius and respect for the favourability principle which is inherent in labour law, implies that this collective agreement takes precedence over health legislation; and (viii) an order from the executive branch that repeals a collective agreement has an impact on both the workers' and the employers' organizations which, through that agreement, established sound labour relations in a climate of social dialogue.
.In its communication of  February , the SAT provides an additional document dated  January , signed by the SAT and the Association of Tobacco and Cigarette Manufacturers and Importers (AFITyC), in which the parties: (i) recall that their collective agreement provides that workers shall receive free, comprehensive health benefits as part of their wages with the costs covered by the enterprises; (ii) reiterate their desire not to modify the provisions of the collective agreement and to cooperate actively in combating any attempt to violate it; and (iii) request the Ministry of Health to keep the current scheme in force.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government denies that the absorption of tobacco workers into the SNIS constitutes interference with their exercise of freedom of association or their right to bargain collectively. It maintains that: (i) the protection of freedom of association has been one of the key elements of the Uruguayan Government s labour policy over the past ten years; (ii) the right to social security is a fundamental human right that is enshrined in the principal international human rights instruments; (iii) since , Uruguay has made significant progress in expanding social security coverage, increasing equity in financing and improving the quality of health benefits; (iv) these efforts have focused on the establishment of the SNIS, which ensures equitable, universal health coverage; (v) the SNIS is financed through a single public fund to which the State, public and private enterprises and all households that receive benefits under the system are required to contribute; (vi) Act No.  of  May  established the National Health Fund (FONASA) and began the gradual inclusion of various groups into the SNIS; (vii) Act No.  of  December  established the guiding principles of the SNIS, which include universal coverage, solidarity in public financing, effectiveness and efficiency in economic and social terms and sustainability in the allocation of resources to comprehensive health care; and (viii) section  of the Act provides that the State, non-state public entities and private enterprises shall contribute  per cent of the total wages that they pay their workers to FONASA.
.The Government adds that, as part of the process of achieving universal health coverage through the SNIS, the aforementioned Act No.  calls for the absorption into that system of workers currently covered by various conventional emergency and insurance schemes and that this was in fact done on  July . Furthermore, section  of the Act empowers the executive branch to accord similar treatment to workers with insurance schemes agreed with private-sector employers through collective agreements or similar instruments. Pursuant to that provision, the executive branch has gradually absorbed into the SNIS various groups in situations analogous to that of the tobacco workers, including, as from  January , members of the Retirement and Pension Fund for Members of the Professions and, as from  January , members of the Bank Workers' Retirement and Pension Fund, who had previously had health insurance pursuant to collective agreements. Thus, the tobacco workers were among the last groups to be absorbed into the system.
.The Government also states that: (i) far from constituting an act of interference with freedom of association and collective bargaining, the absorption of tobacco workers is the outcome of one the most important public policies of the past decade ' the consolidation of a universal health-care system financed through contributions from all of the country s enterprises and workers ' and is thus fully consistent with the Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention,  (No. ), which Uruguay ratified in ; (ii) the purpose of centralizing all affiliates under the SNIS is to eliminate the extreme fragmentation of Uruguay s health care system, within which the social sectors with the greatest potential for organization and the highest wages had established their own subsystems; (iii) in order for the SNIS to be economically and financially sustainable, it is essential for it to be financed by society as a whole in a manner proportionate to enterprises' and citizens' capacity to contribute; and (iv) it is therefore inconceivable that a large industry such as tobacco, in which wages are significantly higher than the national average, should not be absorbed into a national health care system in order both to share in the benefits of its consolidation and to make an equitable contribution to its financing.
.Lastly, the Government states that if the tobacco workers consider that absorption into the SNIS entails a reduction in their current benefits, there is nothing to prevent them from agreeing with their employer, through collective bargaining, to keep their additional benefits and that through such bargaining",0,2015,Uruguay
15,"they can have the same benefits as before, but on the basis of the SNIS.
.The Committee notes that this case concerns allegations of government interference with the exercise of the right to bargain collectively by the SAT, which comprises tobacco workers who had their own health insurance scheme, established through a collective agreement, and have been absorbed into the SNIS by decree.
.The Committee takes note of the complainants' specific allegations that: (i) on  April , on the basis of Act No.  (), the executive branch absorbed the tobacco industry s workers into the SNIS; (ii) this absorption repealed the conventional health insurance scheme that those workers had had since ; (iii) the tobacco industry s collective agreement (which was revised in  and has been tacitly extended since then) provides for better health insurance and benefits than the legal scheme since, in particular, it has offered free, high-quality comprehensive health coverage to tobacco workers, both in service and retired; (iv) the absorption of tobacco workers into the SNIS violates the independence of the parties to collective bargaining in the industry and those workers have expressly requested the Government to keep their conventional health insurance scheme in force; (v) the aforementioned absorption is also contrary to the favourability principle in so far as it gives precedence to health-care legislation that is less beneficial than that provided under the collective agreement and entails a significant reduction in tobacco workers' wages; and (vi) absorption into the SNIS is not an automatic and mandatory consequence of Act No.  (), which established the SNIS, since section  of the Act merely empowers the Government to absorb groups that are covered under a special conventional health insurance scheme.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government: (i) since , the SNIS has been the primary tool for achieving universal health coverage in Uruguay with a view to full implementation of ILO Convention No. . This will require eliminating the fragmentation of the country s health-care system and ensuring that all of its workers and employers, including in industries with wages higher than the national average, contribute to the SNIS; (ii) it is therefore inconceivable that a large industry such as tobacco, in which wages are significantly higher than the national average, should not be absorbed into a national health care system; (iii) tobacco workers were one of the last groups to be absorbed as part of the unification of the national health system in question, after other groups that had also had a conventional health-care system in the past; and (iv) the absorption of tobacco workers into the SNIS does not prevent the industry s workers and employers from agreeing, through a collective agreement, to keep health benefits over and above those required by law; thus, their absorption fully respects the right to bargain collectively.
.The Committee observes from the documents provided by both the complainants and the Government that the tobacco workers were absorbed into the SNIS through the following steps: (i) in , the SNIS was established through Act No. ; (ii) in , an initial decree ordered that the tobacco workers be absorbed into the system; (iii) a second decree, dated  December , postponed the aforementioned absorption until  December ; (iv) Decree No. - postponed this absorption for a second and final time until  April  so that the workers  can conclude the ongoing bargaining with the employers in order to reach agreement regarding the coverage of health-care costs for their group'  and (v) the absorption became effective on  April .
.The Committee also observes that: (i) the tobacco industry s collective agreement, which was signed in , was revised in  and again in , when it was extended by decree; (ii) the agreement itself states that it shall remain in force for one year and shall be renewed automatically for one-year periods unless it is terminated by one of the parties; (iii) in , the signatories to the collective agreement confirmed that the conventional health insurance scheme established therein remained in force and on  January , they jointly requested the executive branch not to absorb the tobacco workers into the SNIS and to keep their conventional health insurance scheme in force; and (iv) furthermore, the SAT has appealed the absorption order before the administrative court and the court s decision is pending.
.In light of the foregoing, the Committee observes that the tobacco workers' absorption by decree into the SNIS as part of a policy leading to a universal, unified Uruguayan health system terminates the specific conventional health insurance scheme that has covered the tobacco workers since . The Committee understands from the Government s observations and the various documents appended to the complaint that the financial contribution to the financing of the national health-care system made by the industry s employers and workers is an important element of this absorption. On this point, the Committee would like to recall firstly that it is not within the mandate of the Committee to examine the opportunity of the establishment of a universal health insurance scheme that includes all of the country s workers, including those groups previously covered by a special conventional scheme. It falls however within the mandate of the Committee to ensure that such a scheme is implemented in a manner consistent with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining, as it has had occasion to do in cases involving the establishment of a universal old-age pension scheme [see th Report, Case No. , para. ].
.In that regard, while noting that the tobacco workers' absorption into the SNIS resulted in the elimination of their special conventional health insurance scheme, thus modifying the content of their collective agreement (which, unless new conventional provisions on health care are adopted, would entail a reduction in benefits that constitute wages for these workers), the Committee observes that Uruguayan law allows employers' and workers' organizations to agree, through a collective agreement, on health benefits over and above those required by law. The Committee therefore points out that the establishment of the SNIS does not exclude health insurance from the scope of collective bargaining and that the tobacco workers' absorption into the SNIS does not result in the automatic elimination of conventional health-care benefits in this industry. The Committee also observes that the tobacco workers' actual absorption into the SNIS was postponed on two occasions through the adoption of special decrees, as a result of which it occurred eight years after the adoption of the initial decree ordering the change in the insurance scheme, so that the signatories to the tobacco industry s collective agreement, which remains in force for one-year periods and is renewed automatically, could adapt the health-related provisions of and benefits under their collective agreement to the new legislative and institutional framework through negotiation. Under these circumstances, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,2015,Uruguay
16,".The complaint is contained in a June  communication from the Inter-Trade Union Assembly ' Workers' National Convention (PIT CNT).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  October .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its June  communication, the Inter-Trade Union Assembly ' Workers' National Convention (PIT CNT) states that the adoption of Act No.  on collective bargaining in the public sector was a major recent milestone given the major effect it is expected to have on the public sector labour relations system. Act No.  genuinely favours workers and makes corresponding demands on the public sector as an employer. Furthermore, it can be argued that the adoption of the Act has led to the recognition of an inherent right to collective bargaining through the reference made in section  of the Act to ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The Act sets forth the content or substance of collective bargaining and sections  to  of the Act define the structure of the collective bargaining system. The structure comprises three bargaining levels: a first level consisting of a senior negotiating council for the public sector made up of eight representatives of the Government and eight representatives of the trade unions that are most representative of public employees nationwide, and in which efforts will be focused on reaching agreements with the most relevant scope possible; a second level consisting of one bargaining panel for each branch or sector (central government, autonomous bodies or decentralized agencies) and also made up of eight representatives of the Government and eight representatives of the trade unions that are most representative in the sector or branch in question; and a third level comprising a bargaining panel made up of the authorities in each department or body and the grass-roots trade union organizations.
.A new Government took office at the beginning of  and a five-year budget was adopted accordingly. An announcement that reform of the State was forthcoming added to the variety of existing complaints, aspirations and demands of trade unions of public employees. As a result, the trade unions of public employees called for collective bargaining at the various levels defined in the Act. Various bargaining sessions were convened and suspended, then eventually held in late July, August and September .
.PIT CNT states that proceedings in those sessions did not even remotely constitute a genuine opportunity for collective bargaining as it is clearly defined in the legislation in force. In those sessions, the public employees' representatives set out their demands but the response from the representatives of the executive branch was insufficient to generate a dynamic of proposals and counter proposals. Worse still, while the sessions were going nowhere, the executive branch was simultaneously working on its draft five-year budget, which included a large number of regulations governing the working conditions of public employees.
.According to PIT CNT, at each and every one of the sessions, the representatives of the workers asked the representatives of the executive branch for information on the process of drawing up the five-year budget, and for economic data that would enable a debate on wages and the wage-adjustment system. Nothing of the sort happened; the representatives of the executive branch did not respond to the requests for information on which discussion and debate should have been based. The executive branch merely expressed its determination not to renew contracts that were about to expire or to change the amount of the minimum wage on the basis of a predetermined number of working hours, and indicated that it would not provide information on the budget because it had not yet been finalized.
.PIT CNT considers that, in the light of the abovementioned legislative provisions, this attitude of the public sector as an employer constitutes a clear violation of the Act in so far as it has failed to meet its obligation to bargain. The obligation to bargain is not an obligation to agree. The fact that there is no such thing as an obligation to agree cannot be interpreted in such a way that bargaining is deprived of any real substance or content. Collective bargaining requires the strict compliance with various processes that give it real meaning. Some of them are substantive and others are instruments intended to expedite bargaining.
.PIT CNT states that, in practice, bargaining involves engaging in discussions on a number of subjects identified in the Act as being the focus of bargaining. The obligation to bargain in good faith and provide information is key to enabling the parties to interact. Whether or not an agreement is reached, there must be a unity of time and place where there is engagement between the parties, making proposals and counter proposals on the basis of information duly provided enough time in advance for it to be analysed.
.PIT CNT considers that worst of all is the fact that the executive branch violated section  on the  right to information'  Section  stipulates, inter alia, that the State must provide information on the progress of work on draft budgets, the economic situation of bodies and possible changes in working conditions. In the absence of such information, bargaining is absolutely impossible, because the draft five-year budget contains all of the subjects for discussion specified in section  of the Act, namely, working conditions, career structures, and management reform, among others. All of these subjects were comprehensively covered in the draft budget but not negotiated for the simple reason that, during bargaining, the executive branch never shared the draft with the other party, the Confederation of Civil Service Trade Unions (COFE), before transmitting it to the legislative branch, even though the workers had persistently sought to have it shared with them. On  August , the executive branch transmitted the draft national budget to the legislative branch. COFE became aware of the content of the draft budget when the executive branch published it on its website.
.According to PIT CNT, the seriousness of this situation is made even clearer by the content of the draft budget. The Government unilaterally defined all of the conditions. For example, it defined criteria for raising and adjusting wages; rules for the handling of public employees' personal data by both Human Resources and the National Civil Service Office; criteria for the redeployment of public employees; criteria for determining employees' leave entitlements; staff budgeting processes and criteria; and criteria for converting budgeted staff posts. It defined which posts are considered to be reserved for particularly trusted employees; established criteria for the payment of certain types of financial compensation (such as allowances for cash shortages); defined criteria for setting wage ceilings; changed the licensing system for employees; defined the procedure to be followed when employees are sick or physically unfit for work; defined criteria for admittance to the civil service; defined promotion criteria and procedures; defined the contractual modalities under which the State hires employees, namely contracts for work, artists' contracts, temporary contracts under public law, employment contracts; and defined other categories of recruited employees, namely interns and trainees.
.These are among the subjects covered in the  employees' chapter in part one of the draft budget. A large number of other provisions that also concern working conditions are also found in the chapters on each of the paragraphs in the budget, namely the ministries and the various agencies. PIT CNT considers that these subjects cover the full range of working conditions, including salaries, of state employees. None of them was agreed or negotiated with COFE. On the contrary, they were drawn up and defined unilaterally by the executive branch, outside the scope of collective bargaining.
.PIT CNT adds that a similarly serious violation of the law occurred when the executive branch promulgated Decree No. / on the reorganization of office hours and staff working hours in the central Government. The authorities summoned COFE to a bargaining session in the presence of the National Labour Director himself and presented the draft decree. COFE expressed its acute concerns about the fact that the Decree enabled sanctions of up to  days to be applied with no investigation being required, and was thus a regression with respect to due process and the system of guarantees, and further stated that the change in office hours increased the working hours of professional and technical staff without a corresponding increase in their wages and might therefore violate constitutional principles on the protection of wages. The executive branch stated that it would examine COFE s observations then convene another meeting to deliver its response. According to PIT CNT, absolutely nothing of the sort ever happened. The only communication received was intended to inform COFE that the Decree was going to be promulgated in the form in which it had been proposed.
.PIT CNT states that all of these facts constitute",0,2011,Uruguay
17,"a violation of the spirit, logic and letter of Act No.  and ILO Conventions Nos ,  and . The Government failed to meet its obligation to bargain. It cannot even be said that it complied with the requirement to consult or inform, namely the minimum form of worker participation.
.In its communications dated  and  October , the Government states that it regretfully cannot agree with the point of view expressed by the state workers' organization, whose version of events is not consistent with the facts. Indeed, the Government considers that various passages of the complaint confirm that there have been numerous opportunities to meet and reach agreements. The Government states that before the current phase of public sector collective bargaining was initiated, various social actors referred to the need to provide a regulatory framework for bargaining in this kind of activity, since a framework would create greater certainty and promote bargaining. As a result, and pursuant to Convention No. , the executive branch issued Decree No. / on  March  to invite public employees' organizations to join a bipartite bargaining panel with a view to establishing a regulatory framework for collective bargaining in the public sector. Decree No. / of  March  subsequently defined the criteria for the membership and operations of the various working groups, of which there were supposed to be three. Finally, a framework agreement on collective bargaining in the public sector was signed on  July . The agreement formalized the context for the negotiation of labour relations with employees, and the State established a senior negotiating council for the public sector for the purpose of conducting high-level collective bargaining. Given the need for legislation on collective bargaining in the public sector, it was decided to draft a bill on collective bargaining in the state sector and define the criteria for implementing that legislation without infringing the freedom of action and powers of the State or the full exercise of trade union rights.
.The agreement was the immediate precedent for Act No.  of  June  on the regulation of collective bargaining in the public sector. This Act, together with Act No.  on collective bargaining in the private sector and Act No.  on freedom of association, was a genuine novelty in national collective law, which was traditionally considered abstentionist and unregulated, and is part of the protective or rights-based model implemented in Uruguay from  onwards. From March  until the adoption of Act No. , some  agreements were signed, ranging from branch framework agreements and wage agreements to specific agreements in a number of bodies.
.Regarding the new collective bargaining system (Act No. ), the Government states that the system in place is governed by the principles set forth in Chapter I (participation, consultation and collaboration, right to collective bargaining, obligation to bargain in good faith, right to information and training in bargaining) of the abovementioned Act, and by internationally recognized labour rights (articles , ,  and  of the Constitution). Collective bargaining in the public sector takes place in two main areas, namely a first area where there is collective bargaining in the executive branch, autonomous bodies and decentralized agencies carrying out the industrial and commercial activities of the State. The first area comprises three levels: (a) the general or highest level ' the senior negotiating council for the public sector; (b) the sectoral or branch level ' bargaining involving autonomous bodies or organized by particular sectors; and (c) the level of each department or body ' bargaining sessions involving trade union organizations representing the grass roots and the bodies in question.
.The second area comprises collective bargaining in the legislative branch, the judiciary, the administrative court, the electoral court, the court of auditors, autonomous bodies of the public school system and departmental governments. Bargaining in this area takes place in bargaining sessions within the framework of the parameters recognized by the Constitution of the Republic.
.The Government states that, before dealing with the substance of the complaint, it considers itself duty-bound to make a few points of a conceptual nature. Indeed, although the complaint is presented by the PIT CNT central workers' organization and its state and municipal employees department, the subject of the complaint almost exclusively concerns employees of the central Government (executive branch employees working in the various ministries) and certain non-commercial decentralized agencies such as the Uruguayan Institute for Children and Adolescents (INAU). These workers are members of COFE and they are the ones affected by the contested budgetary standards. The same applies with regard to Decree No. /. In other words, the complaint in fact relates to a category of public sector workers and not to public sector workers in their entirety.
.Consequently, the following considerations are applicable only to that bargaining unit. In any event, the Government provides information on various public sector negotiations involving other state employees such as employees of public enterprises, teaching institutions, other state bodies, audit agencies and departmental governments. Reference is also made to bargaining in various first-level departments or bodies.
.As regards budgetary standards, the Government states that the special constitutional conditions surrounding the adoption of the National Budget Act are such that a special observation is required for the underlying problem and for the inappropriateness of the complaint to be fully understood. The national budget requires formal approval in the form of an act debated and adopted, obviously, by the national Parliament. Therefore, the national budget needs to be approved, not by the executive branch but, to the best of their ability, by legislators. This is no minor point and it is one of the special conditions affecting collective bargaining in the public sector. Adoption of the National Budget Act is not the same as that of routine legislation since the procedure to be followed is expressly and clearly defined in the Constitution of the Republic. Indeed, by way of example, initiating the budget is the prerogative of the executive branch and the time limits for its adoption are strict.
.One thing that is abundantly clear is that the content of the National Budget Act is not confined to the bill sent by the executive branch. Numerous amendments, deletions and additions are made during the parliamentary adoption process as a result of countless negotiations forming part of a dynamic political process with constant exchanges between legislators and the executive branch as well as various social organizations.
.The Government adds that, upon closer inspection, various passages of the complaint explicitly confirm that there have been numerous opportunities for collective bargaining in the public sector. For example, it is acknowledged that a number of public sector bargaining sessions were organized; the executive branch made proposals on the amount of the minimum wage for employees; and reference is made to COFE being summoned to discuss draft Decree No. /. Therefore, according to the Government, such a negative and critical appraisal of the Government s behaviour is not justified when the complaint itself highlights the large number of meetings and bargaining opportunities.
.The Government adds that the first meeting of the senior negotiating council for the public sector took place on  June , meaning that it is not true that the general sessions under Act No.  did not take place until late July, as the complainant erroneously claims. On that occasion, the Government, acting mainly through the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, explained the broad lines of the incipient draft bill. Meetings were then held during July . The Government provided the workers with a draft document on  strategies and instruments for strengthening state institutions'  previously discussed in the Council of Ministers. The document contained a range of proposals such as a streamlining of labour relations with the State, and the adoption of minimum working hours for employees. The workers, meanwhile, set out their demands and produced a written document with observations on the Government s document.
.Following a series of meetings and numerous exchanges, a decision was taken to open bargaining in the various  activity branches'  namely the central Government, public enterprises, teaching institutions and the like. Discussions in the central Government and non-commercial bodies thus began in July . On  August , COFE made its wage proposal in a note presented to representatives of the executive branch. It requested a minimum wage for public employees of , Uruguayan pesos (UYU). In subsequent meetings, the Government stated that it was considering the introduction of a minimum wage equal to the amount paid for  hours of work per week for central Government workers. As can be seen, the proposal conveniently put forward by the workers and referred to above was used as the starting point and reflected in section  of the National Budget Act (No.  of  December ) which set the abovementioned minimum wage.
.The Government states that bargaining continued until just before the draft budget was transmitted, at a time when an agreement was about to be signed on adjustments and departures on",0,2011,Uruguay
18,"grounds of presenteeism. There was also bargaining during the parliamentary debate on the Act. The bargaining was not fruitless to the extent that a collective agreement covering the Government s entire term was eventually signed. Regarding the definition of contract types, the aim was to simplify labour relations as previously proposed by the Government. In any event, the clear purpose of the legislation is to create greater stability and order in the hiring of public employees.
.The Government states that the obligation to bargain is not an obligation to agree. This is acknowledged by the workers and explicitly set forth in the last paragraph in section  of Act No. . As previously mentioned, solutions were reached jointly in some areas but not in others, as in all bargaining processes. The National Budget Act was eventually adopted as Act No.  on  October . The Act includes explicit references to collective bargaining in the public sector.
.The Government states that bargaining sessions involving workers and the national Government were held at the time the National Budget Act was adopted and subsequently, a collective agreement with COFE was reached, and the accusations made in the present complaint are thus without foundation. A modern approach to labour relations sees them as a dynamic process, as reflected in the events of  and . Moreover, considering that the Government s term has only just begun, there is ample scope for dialogue with workers. Indeed, as of December , the bargaining committee of the central Government attended a variety of meetings to discuss the new wage agreement and debate the new Institutional Strengthening Programme. The broad lines of the Programme were presented by the executive branch in a meeting on  December  and include, inter alia: () organization design; () the new public service; and () the modernization of structures and processes. It was agreed in the meeting that once the broad outlines of the new public service had been defined, it would be submitted to a bargaining session.
.There were further meetings on , , ,  and  December  specifically devoted to negotiating the new wage agreement. After the meetings held at the headquarters of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, the wage agreement was signed on  December . The five-year agreement sets the guidelines to be followed by the central Government in the wage-adjustment process and establishes the procedures and mechanisms guiding wage discussions between the parties. In addition to setting general wage adjustments, the agreement provides for selective salary adjustments to allow advancement within each grade of the salary scale established within the framework of the central Government s new occupational and salary system. According to the agreement, a working group will be set up on  and  May every year to consider individual cases and determine the abovementioned adjustments. The working group is to be tasked with assessing the feasibility of formalizing the incentive set forth in section  of the '  National Budget Act while taking into account the constraints specified in the Act.
.After the agreement had been signed, the trade union requested a meeting to deal, inter alia, with the regulatory decree relating to the minimum wage in the central Government. Before the meeting, the executive branch asked the trade union to send a list of amounts that, in its opinion, should not be included in the calculation of a minimum wage. Meetings were then held on  February and  March, in which the trade union raised a number of points concerning the implementation of the new contracts provided for in the National Budget Act, and consultations were organized to consider the possibility of excluding other amounts specified in the list for the implementation of a minimum wage. The executive branch took into account the points made by the trade union, including most of the amounts identified by the trade union as being suitable for exclusion from the calculation of the minimum wage. Lastly, a fresh meeting with COFE was held on  May .
.The Government states that there have been numerous bargaining opportunities at all bargaining levels in the public sector. This is evidence of compliance with the duty to participate, consult and collaborate, as set forth in section  of Act No. . All of the events organized were genuine opportunities to bargain in which representatives of each sector (workers and government) took part, making proposals and counter proposals that led to agreements being concluded in the vast majority of cases. The number of meetings held and the agreements concluded reflect the executive branch s interest and willingness to engage in collective bargaining with respect to all issues arising from working conditions in the public sector, and to refrain from imposing unilateral solutions, contrary to the complainant s allegations. There is no doubt that the obligation to engage in dialogue and exchange information has been met, in accordance with the provisions of section  of Act No. . The State has at all times promoted and guaranteed this right by addressing the requests to bargain by public sector workers for the purpose not only of dealing with issues arising from working conditions but also of resolving conflict situations, thereby ensuring the comprehensive implementation of the existing legislation.
.Regarding Decree No. /, the Government states that the draft decree was presented to the trade unions in the form of a document that included regulations on the minimum hours of presence of employees who did not do six hours of work per day at the time the legislation was adopted. Some months earlier, the Government had already brought this issue to the attention of the trade unions, who considered that the Government had merely compiled a new document containing provisions that were already in force, and had not made any substantial innovations. The Government states that the complainant acknowledges that the legislation was submitted for consideration before being adopted. Close analysis of the Decree shows that the provision actually reordered a range of existing legislation that concerned the relevant aspects of labour relations but was scattered across older Acts and decrees. The new legislation did not introduce any substantial novelties. The sanctions mentioned in the legislation refer only to unjustified absences by employees. Furthermore, the claim that the legislation is not rights-based is not true. Indeed, according to section  of the abovementioned Decree, once an instance of misconduct has been recorded, the employee is given the opportunity to make comments, and following due consideration of the comments and the employee s track record, a sanction may be adopted. There are administrative opportunities to appeal against the sanction, which can be struck down by the administrative court. Lastly, the Government states that state employees instituted amparo (protection of constitutional rights) proceedings against the executive branch s Decree, and the subsequent rulings went against the workers in both the court of first instance and the court of second instance.
.The Committee observes that, in this case, the complainant organization alleges that even though the adoption of Act No.  on collective bargaining in the public sector was a major milestone in the public sector labour relations system, the executive branch sent a draft budget to the legislative branch in  without having presented the draft, bargained or reached an agreement on state employees' working conditions with COFE, and without having reported on changes in the status of the draft five-year budget; according to the allegations, the draft was sent to the legislative branch before being presented to the abovementioned organization (the complainant does, however, acknowledge that there were some invitations and that a number of meetings took place with representatives of the executive branch). The complainant organization further alleges that the executive branch promulgated Decree No. / on the reorganization of the working hours of staff in the central Government, and the authorization of sanctions with no prior investigation being required, without taking into account the observations made by COFE in that regard.
.Regarding the allegations according to which the executive branch sent a draft budget to the legislative branch in , without having bargained or reached an agreement on state employees' working conditions with COFE, and without having reported on changes in the status of the draft five-year budget ' according to the allegations, the draft was sent to the legislative branch before being presented to the abovementioned organization ' the Committee notes that the Government states, first of all, that: () the complaint almost exclusively concerns employees of the central Government (executive branch employees working in the various ministries) and certain non-commercial decentralized agencies; () those employees are members of COFE and they are the ones affected by the contested budgetary standards; and () this means that the complaint in fact relates to a category of public sector workers and not to public sector workers in their entirety (the Government has provided information on public sector bargaining with other groups of state employees such as those",0,2011,Uruguay
19,"in public enterprises, teaching institutions and the like).
.Specifically, as far as the allegations are concerned, the Committee takes note that the Government states that: () the national budget requires formal approval in the form of an Act passed by the national Parliament ' this is no minor point and it is one of the special conditions affecting collective bargaining in the public sector; () adoption of the national budget is not the same as that of routine legislation since the procedure to be followed is expressly defined as being different in the Constitution of the Republic: by way of example, initiating the budget is the prerogative of the executive branch and the time limits for its adoption are strict; () the entire content of the Budget Act is not confined to the bill sent by the executive branch, and numerous amendments, deletions and additions are made during the parliamentary process; () the complainant acknowledges that a number of public sector bargaining sessions did take place; () the first meeting of the senior negotiating council for the public sector took place on  June , and on that occasion, the Government, acting mainly through the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, explained the broad lines of the incipient draft bill; () meetings were then held during July , the Government provided the workers with a draft document on  strategies and instruments for strengthening state institutions'  the document contained a range of proposals such as a streamlining of labour relations with the State, and the adoption of minimum working hours for employees; () the workers, meanwhile, set out their demands and produced a written document with observations on the Government s document; () following a series of meetings and numerous exchanges, a decision was taken to open bargaining in the various  activity branches'  namely the central Government, public enterprises, teaching institutions and the like, and discussions in the central Government and non-commercial bodies thus began in July ; () on  August , COFE made its wage proposal in a note presented to representatives of the executive branch, and requested a minimum wage for public employees of UYU, (the Government proposed the same minimum wage, which was recorded in what became section  of National Budget Act No.  of  December ); () bargaining continued until just before the draft budget was transmitted; () regarding the definition of contract types, the aim was to simplify labour relations as previously proposed by the Government; () as acknowledged by the workers, the obligation to bargain is not an obligation to agree, but solutions were reached jointly in some areas but not in others, as in all bargaining processes; and () there have been numerous bargaining opportunities at all bargaining levels in the public sector and all of the events organized were genuine opportunities to bargain in which representatives of each sector (workers and government) took part, information was exchanged and proposals and counter proposals were made that led to agreements being concluded in the vast majority of cases.
.In this regard, while the Committee observes that the accounts given by the complainant and the Government are contradictory when it comes to the exchange of information during the bargaining process concerning the draft budget (the complainant alleges that information was very limited and that as a result it did not become aware of the draft budget until it was transmitted to the legislative branch, whereas the Government argues that information was shared as and when the situation changed and that the trade union organizations produced their own set of demands), the Committee takes note that the Government points out that there were bargaining opportunities with COFE before and after the adoption of the National Budget Act, including agreements between the parties on wages, and a number of later meetings with COFE dealt with other issues. Given the above, the Committee cannot conclude that there was no genuine bargaining, although it does consider that, in future, parties to bargaining should be informed of the regulations provided for in the draft five-year budget affecting the interests of the social partners.
.Regarding the allegations that Decree No. / was promulgated without taking COFE s observations into consideration, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the draft decree was presented to the trade unions in the form of a document that included regulations on the minimum hours of presence of employees who did not do six hours of work per day at the time the legislation was adopted; () some months earlier, the Government had already brought this issue to the attention of the trade unions, who considered that the Government had merely compiled a new document containing provisions that were already in force, and had not made any substantial innovations; () the complainant acknowledges that the legislation was brought to its attention before being adopted; () the Decree actually reordered a range of existing rules that concerned the relevant aspects of labour relations but was scattered across older Acts and decrees; () the sanctions provided refer only to unjustified absences by employees (the decision can be challenged by means of an administrative appeal and can be struck down by the administrative court); and () state employees instituted amparo proceedings against the Decree, and the subsequent rulings went against the workers in both the court of first instance and the court of second instance. In the light of this information and the ruling in question, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2011,Uruguay
20,".The complaint is contained in a communication of February  from the Association of Customs Officials (AFA) of Uruguay.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of February , the AFA states that it is the only representative trade union organization for public servants employed by the Uruguay s National Customs Directorate (DNA). It is a juridical entity recognized by the Ministry of Education and Culture and is governed by its own by-laws approved by the Ministry. The AFA adds that the DNA is a dependent body attached to the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and that its senior official is the National Customs Director.
.The AFA is affiliated to Uruguay s Single Workers' Federation, the Workers' Inter-Union Plenary National Workers' Convention (PIT CNT), and, at the sectoral level, to the Confederation of Public Servants' Organizations (COFE). It is also a member of the MERCOSUR Federation of State Customs and Tax Officials (FRASUR).
.The AFA alleges that for several years it has been the victim of various forms of discrimination by the authorities, which have cancelled or reduced benefits that the AFA has acquired over its long history (almost invariably through trade union action that often involved union-led protests against such measures).
.The AFA states that just recently, faced with a Budget Act that substantially modifies the system of sharing out among all DNA officials of the proceeds of customs fines and seizures, the Association was obliged to take union action; this mainly consisted of work stoppages none of which affected areas that can be deemed essential services ' a standard practice of the Association in the exercise of its power of self-regulation. The AFA states that it was  forced' to take such steps because the National Director did not use the collective bargaining machinery which is provided for in Uruguay s legal system for public servants (Act No.  of ) and which was indispensable to resolve an issue as sensitive and negotiable as wages and salaries.
.The AFA asserts that, previously, the Ministry of the Economy dealt through bodies that were nothing but a  sham' in terms of negotiations, since its representatives declared in advance as non-negotiable, immutable and irrelevant precisely those issues of salaries and income from customs fines and seizures that were of particular concern to the Association. The two or three meetings that were held at the Ministry by these bodies ended when the chairperson abruptly decided that they were over. Since the loss of these and other benefits was already included in the draft budget, the AFA s assembly decided to take the action mentioned above.
.According to the AFA, the National Director s attitude towards the steps taken by the Association was decidedly anti-union from the start. In a press conference he publicly demonstrated a total disregard for national and international standards on freedom of association, the right to strike, collective bargaining and, specifically, the provisions of the Constitution (articles ,  and ), of the ILO s Conventions (Nos  and ) and of the Protection of Freedom of Association and Trade Union Rights Act No.  and the Public Service Collective Bargaining Act No. , among others.
.The first anti-union measure the Director took was to send an internal mail to the customs officials demanding that they state and sign in writing whether or not they took part in the work stoppages, ostensibly so as to dock their wages accordingly. In the view of the AFA, this constitutes interference in its internal union affairs and an attack on collective and individual freedom of association, both directly and indirectly. To begin with, the measure undermines freedom of association because it seeks to weaken the Association s action and to impose formal requirements that are not provided for in any national law; moreover, such a public and explicit declaration on the part of the workers is perceived as a threat and is therefore liable to discourage participation in the strike called by the Association for fear of reprisals. Directly, the measure inhibits the freedom of association of those who took part in the work stoppage by placing them in a moral dilemma; indirectly, it inhibits freedom of association inasmuch as non-participants in the work stoppage are likewise required to make a public and explicit declaration that they did not participate, which without any legal grounds whatsoever exposes them vis--vis their trade union.
.The AFA states that it rejected the measure and lodged an administrative appeal against it, based on national and international standards on freedom of association and the right to strike and on the irrefutable grounds that it is the senior management s responsibility to carry out the necessary verifications itself or through the intermediate management, so as to determine which officials worked and which did not and to dock wages accordingly ' in strict proportion to the time not worked because of the strike. The AFA adds that, as a corollary to this discriminatory measure, an equally serious measure was taken along the same lines. When the officials received their pay for the month concerned, they discovered that the wage cuts were completely arbitrary and bore no relation to the time people actually stopped working. Even some non-participants' wages were docked and, worse still, the wages cuts were described as  fines'  whereas fines are purely and simply prohibited under the international standards that Uruguay has ratified.
.According to the AFA, despite the administrative appeal lodged by the customs officials on the grounds mentioned above, two months later (in November ) the workers were informed in a similar communication from the Director that their wages were to be docked, again by amounts that were arbitrary and likewise described as  fines'  in clear proof of the Director s systematically anti-union attitude. As the Director maintained his refusal to negotiate and the labour dispute grew, and since the date for Parliament to vote the budget was approaching, the work stoppages intensified and the anti-union atmosphere increased to an unprecedented degree. The customs officials were again sent communications inviting those who were prepared to take the place of striking workers to report to the areas or posts most severely affected. For this they were paid travel allowances to facilitate their movements from one part of the country to another, and were given the necessary codes and rank that had hitherto been assigned to the strikers. At the same time pressure was brought to bear by their superiors on trainees and temporary staff, who did not have the necessary training for the job and were prohibited by law from performing certain duties because of the shortness of their contracts, their young age and their inexperience ' even though in several cases they actually took over from the striking workers.
.Contrary to normal procedure, the measures were announced by the National Director at a press conference in the presence of several of the country s leading economic figures, whom he assured that the customs services would be maintained at all costs. That constituted not just an infringement of freedom of association and the right to strike but a public and nationwide admission of his disregard for the AFA and for union action as well.
.Finally, the complainant organization states that the dispute ended with the signing of a collective agreement on  November  by the AFA and the Plenary of the Economy (a subsector of the State Workers' Confederation comprising the trade unions at the Ministry of the Economy), on the one hand, and the Minister of the Economy, the Director-General of the Ministry s secretariat and the National Director of Customs, on the other. The agreement contained a series of provisions that were contrary to the terms of the draft budget presented by the Executive on which the Senate was in the process of voting. At a meeting with the National Director on  November , and to the AFA s dismay, the Director informed it that the budget was not going to be  retouched'  that no such steps to do so were going to be taken by Parliament and that later, at the drafting stage of the relevant regulations, they would see how the terms of the agreement could be reconciled with the provisions of the budget.
.According to the AFA, it was obvious from this that the negotiations that had ended in the signing of the collective agreement had not been conducted in good faith by the authorities as required by law, inasmuch as, since the Ministry of the Economy was part of the Executive, it was only to be expected that as a co-signatory it would take all the steps at its disposal to inform the members of Parliament of the terms of the agreement, of the Government s change of heart and of the modification that this entailed",0,2011,Uruguay
21,"of certain provisions of the earlier draft text, and that these would be submitted to them in due course so that the final text could be amended while there was still time prior to its adoption by Parliament.
.The AFA adds that, immediately after the dispute, the DNA issued instructions for the application of an Executive Decree that unilaterally modified the working conditions of customs officials that had been in operation since . The Decree increased hours of work without any increase in pay and once again disregarded the requirement that the issue be the subject of collective bargaining.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states, at the outset, that in its view the complaint is out of all proportion to any disagreement and misunderstanding that may exist between the management of the DNA and the AFA. It further recalls that, according to the Committee on Freedom of Association itself,  customs officials are covered by Convention No.  and therefore have the right to organize' 
.Regarding the allegation concerning the requirement that the workers indicate in a written and signed declaration whether or not they took part in the work stoppage, the Government says that it naturally agrees that a statement of participation in a work stoppage is not a formal requirement for a strike to be lawful, inasmuch as Uruguay has absolute and unfettered freedom of association. Moreover, public servants enjoy total job stability and can only be dismissed on grounds that are set out explicitly in the Constitution; in addition, the law protects them from any discrimination on grounds of trade union activities. Since the system offers such extensive guarantees, it would seem disproportionate for the AFA to take offence only because the administration seeks to identify the workers who exercised their right to strike, simply for purposes of docking their wages for time not worked.
.The DNA, in Communications Nos / and / from the Resources Division, called on customs officials to indicate whether or not they had participated in certain work stoppages so as to make the corresponding deductions from the wage bill. Such communications are nothing new in the customs service and had already been sent by previous national directors. Communication No.  of  was couched in almost exactly the same words as Communication No.  of , though it is unknown whether the AFA or any customs official lodged an appeal against the Director at the time for anti-union practices.
.The Government asserts that what the current Director did was simply to continue an established practice, which is in fact based on Executive Decree No. / of  August , section  of which requires the wages of central administration officials to be docked  in proportion to the extent to which their union action entails a reduction in the performance of their duties during normal working hours; this includes union or similar action such as working to rule, slowdowns , sit-down strikes, etc' 
.Preambular paragraph VII of Decree No. / states:  Following the adoption of these measures, the wages of participation officials are to be docked in proportion to the reduction in the work carried out. In such cases, the executive directors are to communicate to the directors-generals of the secretariat the list of names of the officials concerned and the assessment of the reduction in work.' It is worth mentioning that no complaint was lodged with the ILO against this Executive Decree on anti-union grounds either. The DNA is an executive unit attached to the Ministry of Economy and Finance and, as such, is required to send the communication referred to in the previous paragraph, on pain of incurring administrative liability.
.The Government states that the docking of wages required under the aforementioned Decree ' which is the latest standard on the subject ' is further based on article  of the Consolidated Financial Accounts and Administration Act, articles '  of the Consolidated Public Servants Act (TOFUP), established national doctrine and Uruguay s case law. It suffices in this respect to refer to Ruling No.  of  October , handed down by the Administrative Disputes Tribunal, which declared that  any public servants who cease to carry out their duties for whatever reason (strike, working to rule, etc.) shall be guilty of a breach of contract and therefore liable to a management decision to dock their wages in proportion to the reduction in their output' 
.The Government adds that, in order to dock officials' wages, the employer has to know who participated in the union action and who did not. In the event of strikes, where no one is present at the workplace, it is easy to know who the participants were. To put it more graphically, workers who clocked in did not participate in the union action, while those who did not clock in did participate and should have their wages docked accordingly. But in strikes where some workers are in fact present and in sit-down strikes, it is not so simple, because the workers clock in as if they are present, and time sheets can no longer be relied on to prove participation in a strike. And there is the added complication that the DNA s jurisdiction, being territorial, comprises a broad geographical area with  administrations covering the country as a whole ' central headquarters, Montevideo airport, Carrasco airport, free zones, domestic airports and river ports, which in the interior of the country are very widespread. Consequently, the ability of the administration, of the administrators, of the department heads or division directors to verify workers' participation in a work stoppage effectively is curtailed, to say the least. Moreover, where in the past it was the head of the department who decided who took part in the work stoppage, workers sometimes lodged appeals on the ground that they were not on strike. From  onwards, therefore, the previous administration introduced the system whereby the workers themselves declared whether or not they participated in a strike.
.This was the procedure that was followed to make the relevant deductions in compliance with the regulations in force, and no other proposal has come forward either from the Parliamentary Labour Legislation Committee, with which the AFA lodged its complaint, or even from the AFA in its various communications. If one accepts that when there is a work stoppage, wages have to be docked accordingly ' which even the AFA recognizes ' then there has to be some way of establishing who used the right to strike in the present instance, since the regulations in force have to be applied and the corresponding wage cuts applied, just as Director-General of the Secretariat of the Ministry of Economy and Finance has to be informed of the list of participating officials and of the volume of work not carried out.
.Far from engaging in anti-union discrimination, the National Director in fact applied the regulations in force and gave the workers the possibility, in exercise of their unrestricted right to strike under article  of the Constitution and under international treaties, to declare whether or not they took part in the work stoppage. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to know who was on strike and who was not, since in this kind of work stoppage the officials clock in as if they are present. However, following the complaint of union repression that the AFA lodged with the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour against the DNA, the Inspectorate issued a ruling calling on the DNA to change its method of verifying officials' participation in union action while present at their work stations, in keeping with Decree No. / and with the requirements of the DNA, and requesting that the Inspectorate be informed of the new arrangements.
.Regarding the allegation that the deductions from wages for exercising the right to strike were arbitrary, the National Director of Customs, as the highest authority in the country s customs service, is obliged to apply the regulations in force concerning the docking of wages. The AFA, for its part, claims that workers who did not participate in the strike had their wages docked, though without presenting any evidence ' and in circumstances where there was obviously a possibility of error quite independent of any infringement of the freedom of association of the workers who did not exercise their right to strike. The AFA further claims that the deductions were described as  fines'  and that is true. But  fines' is the term used in the computer programme for paying the salaries of the entire Uruguayan central administration ' and not just the DNA ' under the Integrated Financial Data System (SIIF) and derives from the Classification of Items of Expenditure used by the General Accounts Department of Uruguay (which the Government attached). But of course it is just a word, and docked wages do not in fact correspond to fines but are simply deductions for days on strike.
.The Government stresses that the AFA does",0,2011,Uruguay
22,"not say what exactly it considers to be arbitrary. It obviously cannot be the docking of wages from officials who were on strike; nor can the AFA be referring to the use of a term that is not the responsibility or invention of the National Director of Customs. The Government adds that, when dealing with people s assets, there is bound to be a possibility of human error, in one direction or the other. However, if there genuinely is a documented mistake, a solution can always be found that is in keeping with the law. The Government affirms that it is perfectly willing to review any material error that the administration may have committed.
.The Government states that the so-called communication about replacing officials on strike with officials not involved in the work stoppage, which the AFA sees as an anti-union measure, never existed. What is true is that officials not on strike did work in the National Customs Administration, as is their inalienable right and which ensured the functioning of an essential service ' which is the case of foreign trade. Quite apart from customs officers' tax collection work, one only has to think of their role in maintaining public safety and health to illustrate that it cannot come to a stop simply because a group of workers decide, as is their right, to go on strike.
.Moreover, the Government does not at all share the complainant s belief that striking officials were replaced by  trainees and temporary staff who did not have the necessary training for the job and were prohibited by law from performing certain duties'  since the officials concerned were for the most part workers employed on the regular budget, and of course trainees who for the most part are university and tertiary-level students who are both young and eager to get ahead with their job. For the Government, filling posts by reorganizing assignments is not discriminatory, so long as it is not a question of employing strike-breakers but simply of an administrator exercising his legal and constitutional prerogatives.
.The Government also denies the AFA s contention that  at a press conference in the presence of several of the country s leading economic figures'  the National Director of Customs admitted  publicly' to anti-union measures. If there had been no union action, it would have been ridiculous for the Director to make any such admission. What he did say to the press on several occasions was that essential customs services would be maintained by officials who were not on strike.
.Regarding the alleged non-respect of a collective agreement, the Government states, first of all, that non-respect of a collective agreement does not per se constitute anti-unionism. Moreover, it was not in fact a case of non-compliance but rather of strict compliance with the agreement. As to the AFA s allegation of so-called  non-respect' itself, the agreement in point of fact stipulates that the Merit Fund to be provided for in the budget will be for all customs officials and will be shared out notably in recognition of their direct participation in the verification of infringements of the law and in the attainment of other personal and group targets. This undertaking was inserted in the budget at the express insistence of the National Director of Customs, and so it is hard to see how there can be any suggestion of non-compliance.
.Section  of National Budget Act No.  reads:The proceeds of fines for the commission of all infringements of customs regulations shall be shared out as follows: Seventy per cent for the constitution of a Merit Fund destined especially to compensate the DNA officials. In sharing out the proceeds of the Fund, account will be taken of the attainment of personal, group and institutional targets and of the participation of officials in the detection of infringements of customs regulations. The scope of this provision shall be regulated by the Executive.
.The Government adds that it is altogether unacceptable to claim moreover that, by not going against the wishes of a state institution such as the Parliament to ensure that the AFA s demands are inserted into a law, the National Director of Customs was somehow engaging in a form of anti-unionism. The AFA even accuses the Director of not taking  all the steps at his disposal to inform the members of Parliament of the terms of the agreement'  when in fact he went so far as to publish the collective agreement on his website. It was quite clearly the Director who took the initiative in advocating the standard that was included in the agreement; in any case the AFA could just as easily have informed everybody who was interested of the terms of the agreement it had signed.
.Regarding the alleged modification of the conditions of employment by increasing the hours of work, the Government states that the working day in the DNA used to be based on two official schedules dating back to , which stipulated a minimum number of hours rather than a maximum. Then, on  October , the Executive issued Decree No. /, section  of which stipulates that  normal working hours shall in no case be less than six hours per day or  hours per week' and that  all legal provisions regarding working hours that entail more hours of work than the minimum shall remain in force'  Article  goes on to state:  No regulation issued by the Ministry or by the senior management that conflicts with the provisions of this Decree shall be applicable.' In other words, the section revoked the DNA s internal regulations providing for shorter minimum working hours. Furthermore, the Decree stressed that legal provisions entailing more hours of work than the minimum were still valid. This was precisely the situation in the DNA, for which section  of Act No.  stipulated longer working hours:  For public officials employed under Programme  ' Collection of Customs Duties and Comptroller of Goods in Transit ' the normal working week shall be  hours. Any official wishing to do so may opt for this schedule within  days of the publication of this Act.' According to the Government, all the regular budget customs officials on the DNA s payroll opted for the new schedule, except for one official who is therefore not bound by the longer working week.
.The Government points out that it is obvious that the Director simply did his duty and applied the regulations in force, without engaging in any form of anti-unionism. As far as the six-hour day being fixed by decree and without any consultation is concerned, the fact is that six hours a day is less than the official working week of  hours for customs officials (section  of Act No. ).
.According to the Government, the complainant presupposes that all administrative decisions are necessarily subject to negotiation and, moreover, that all negotiations must end in an agreement that is close to the AFA s position; but that is not what national and international standards on the subject say. Section  of Collective Bargaining (Public Sector) Act No.  does not require that there be agreement but rather establishes the reasonable principle that  the parties are obliged to negotiate, which does not mean that they are bound to reach agreement'  To sum up, the complainant organization is being altogether excessive when it denounces a situation that appears to be entirely within the law, inasmuch as the administration has exercised its powers reasonably, has negotiated without reaching agreement on certain points and, finally, has simply asked the officials on strike to identify themselves so that their wages can be docked accordingly. Far from being a form of anti-unionism, this practice recognizes the legitimacy of the union s action and merely serves to draw attention to the obvious consequences from the standpoint of the employer.
.In conclusion, the Government considers that it is clear from its reply that the so-called anti-union actions of the DNA never existed, but that what actually happened ' and what remains the case ' is that the DNA abided strictly by the law and demonstrated at all times its determination as effectively and efficiently as possible to maintain a service that is essential both for foreign trade and for the population as a whole. The DNA s dialogue and good relations with the AFA is a priority for the customs administration, which has been negotiating a comprehensive collective agreement with the AFA on various aspects of trade union activities that should benefit both parties.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges that the Budget Act modified the system for sharing out the proceeds of customs fines and seizures among DNA officials and failed to take into account the provisions of a collective agreement concluded on  November , and that it unilaterally modified their conditions of employment by increasing the hours of work without first engaging in collective bargaining. The Committee observes also",-1,2011,Uruguay
23,"that the complainant contests: () the DNA s decision to demand that officials declare whether or not they took part in a work stoppage, supposedly so that their wages could be docked; () the arbitrary nature of reductions in pay that had nothing to do with the work stoppages, and their description as fines; and () the pressure that was brought to bear on officials to take the place of workers on strike.
.With regard to the allegation that the Budget Act modified the system for distributing the proceeds of customs fines and seizures among DNA officials without taking into account the provisions of a collective agreement concluded on  November , the Committee notes that the Government states that: () it was not a case of non-compliance but rather of strict compliance; () it was at the insistence of the National Director of Customs that the undertaking concerning the sharing out of the proceeds of fines was included in the Budget Act; () the provisions of the collective agreement with the AFA coincide exactly with the provisions that were embodied in the Budget Act and there is therefore no question of anti-unionism; and () the fines are to be shared out among all customs officials, albeit with allowance for their participation and performance. Taking into account this information and the Government s assurances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.Regarding the allegations that, disregarding the collective bargaining requirement, the DNA modified conditions of employment unilaterally by increasing the number of working hours, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () the working day in the DNA used to be governed by two instructions issued in  that set a minimum rather than a maximum number of hours; () on  October , the Executive issued Decree No. /, section  of which stipulates that  normal working hours shall in no case be less than six hours per day or  hours per week' and that  all legal provisions regarding working hours that call for more hours of work than the minimum shall remain in force'  () section  went on to state that  no provisions issued by the Ministry or by the senior management that conflict with the provisions of this Decree shall be applicable'  () consequently, internal decisions of the DNA providing for shorter minimum working hours were accordingly annulled by section  but, as stressed in the Decree, legal requirements entailing longer working hours than the minimum remained applicable, as was the case in the DNA under section  of Act No.  which provided for longer working hours that any official could sign up to within  days of the publication of the Act; and () all the regular budget customs officials who are currently on the DNA payroll opted for the new schedule, except for one official who is therefore not bound by the longer working week. The Committee points out in this respect that, though it must be made clear that higher-level administrative regulations take precedence over lower-level regulations, it would be desirable if the workers' organizations could be consulted on measures such as these that entail changes in practical matters. However, mindful of the information communicated by the Government, and notably of the fact that all the officials except one opted freely for the new work schedule, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.Regarding the AFA s objections to the DNA s decision to demand that customs officials state and sign in writing whether or not they took part in the work stoppage, under the pretext of having to dock their wages accordingly, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () it agrees that a declaration of participation in a work stoppage is not a formal requirement for a strike to be lawful, inasmuch as Uruguay enjoys absolute and unfettered freedom of association; () public servants enjoy total job stability, and it would seem out of proportion for the organization to take offence simply because the administration sought to identify the workers who exercised their right to strike, merely for purposes of docking wages for time not worked; () the DNA s Resources Division, in Communications Nos / and /, called on customs officials to indicate whether or not they had participated in certain work stoppages, so as to make the corresponding deductions from the wage bill; () such communications are nothing new in the customs service and have in the past been issued by previous national directors; () in strikes where no one is present at the workplace it is easy to know who the participants are, but in strikes where some workers are present or in sit-down strikes it is not so simple, because workers clock in as if they are present and time sheets can no longer serve to verify participation in a strike; () there is the added complication that the DNA s jurisdiction, being territorial, comprises a broad geographical area, with  administrations covering the country as a whole; () far from engaging in anti-union discrimination, the National Director in fact applied the regulations in force and gave the workers the possibility, in exercise of their unrestricted right to strike, to declare whether or not they took part in the work stoppage, since otherwise it would have been impossible to know who was on strike and who was not; and () nonetheless, following the complaint of trade union rights violations that the AFA lodged against the DNA with the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour, the Inspectorate issued a ruling calling on the DNA to change its method of verifying workers' participation in union action while on the job, in keeping with Decree No. / and with the requirements of the DNA s executive branch. The Committee considers in this respect that the decision to request workers to declare whether or not they took part in the strike so as to be able to dock their wages accordingly does not in itself violate the principles of freedom of association. That being so, and bearing in mind that according to the Government the General Labour Inspectorate intervened and recommended a change in the manner of verifying workers' presence on the job but did not conclude that trade union rights had been infringed, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.Regarding the allegation that the reductions in wages were completely arbitrary and bore no relation to the actual work stoppage, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () the complainant organizations does not say what exactly it claims was arbitrary; () when dealing with people s assets, there is bound to be a possibility of human error, in one direction or the other, but if it is a genuine, documented mistake a solution can always be found that is in keeping with the law; and () it is perfectly willing to review any material error that the administration may have committed. Noting the Government s willingness to reconsider any deductions that may by error have been more or less than they should have been, the Committee invites the complainant organization, should it detect any irregularity in deductions from pay, to pass on the information to the administration so that the officials can be adequately compensated.
.Regarding the allegations that deductions from pay for days on strike were described as  fines'  the Committee notes the Government s statement that  fines' is the term used in the computer programme for paying the salaries of the entire Uruguayan central administration ' and not just the DNA ' under the SIIF and derives from the Classification of Items of Expenditure used by the General Accounts Department of Uruguay, and that docked wages do not in fact correspond to fines but are simply deductions for days on strike. Taking this information into account, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.Finally, regarding the allegation that pressure was brought to bear on workers to replace the striking officials, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () the so called communication about replacing officials on strike with officials not involved in the work stoppage never existed; () what is true is that officials not on strike did work in the National Customs Administration, as is their inalienable right; () it does not at all share the complainant s belief that striking officials were replaced by  trainees and temporary staff who did not have the necessary training for the job and were prohibited by law from performing certain duties'  since the officials concerned were for the most part workers employed on the regular budget, and of course also trainees who are mainly university and tertiary-level students; and () filling posts by reorganizing assignments is not discriminatory, so long as it is not a question of employing strike-breakers but simply of an administrator exercising his legal and constitutional prerogatives. Bearing in mind",-1,2011,Uruguay
24,"this information, and specifically that no workers were recruited to replace those on strike, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:With regard to the allegation that the deductions for days on strike in the National Customs Directorate were arbitrary and bore no relationship to the actual work stoppage, the Committee notes the Government s willingness to review any deductions that may by mistake have been more or less than they should have been and invites the complainant organization, should it detect any irregularity in deductions from pay, to pass on the information to the administration so that the officials can be adequately compensated.",-1,2011,Uruguay
25,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the Inter-Trade Union Assembly orkers' National Convention (PIT CNT), the Confederation of Civil Service Trade Unions (COFE) and the Association of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries Officials (AFGAP). These organizations sent further information in a communication dated  July .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  November  and  March .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the PIT CNT, the COFE and the AFGAP indicate that they are formulating a complaint against the Government of Uruguay for violation of the principles contained in ILO Conventions Nos ,  and . The complainants indicate that animal health officials belong to the livestock departments of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries and perform duties relating to supervision and control of the health status of livestock production in the country. Within the Association of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries Officials they comprise a core group whose representatives are elected by secret ballot. The animal health officials' working hours are eight hours per day, Monday to Friday but, on account of the duties they perform, they work outside the regular timetable, practically  to order' and on a  full-time basis'  including Saturdays and Sundays.
.Since March  the animal health officials, in their core group within the AFGAP and in conjunction with the association s representatives, began to hold talks with the authorities in the context of negotiations to deal with two basic elements which are problematic in the officials' work: the lack of human resources and the salary payable for overtime worked, whether for working or non-working days, including rest days. Their complaint essentially called for compliance with the terms of the legislation in force in the country, in the form of  public order' regulations, inasmuch as the latter may not be disregarded, even if so agreed by the parties concerned (section  of Act No.  and Regulatory Decree No. /). The complainants point out that the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries in general and the livestock departments in particular have a serious human resources problem. In the decade preceding the term of office of the current Government which began in , the livestock departments lost almost  per cent of their officials and, in the last three years, they have seen a reduction of nearly  per cent in the numbers of officials. Moreover, in the livestock departments, according to a survey carried out by the Ministry itself,  officials comprising  per cent of the total staff are due to reach retirement age in .
.Even though systems were approved during this government term for the entry of new officials, the AFGAP claims that these were insufficient to ensure that the livestock departments are able to duly perform their assigned duties and in the course of time maintain the health status currently enjoyed by the country. In general terms of age,  per cent of officials are over  years of age and  per cent are over . In the livestock departments, the average age is around  years. Age becomes a key factor in the performance of the duties attached to posts in the Animal Health Department. This is illustrated by the job profile featuring in the call for applications to the department, which contains the following wording:  Physical effort ' Duties involve intensive and sustained physical effort, often producing fatigue or tension owing to pressure of work'  With regard to working conditions, it states:  Duties are performed under conditions where there is a high risk of serious accidents or injury to physical and/or mental health' 
.Maintenance of the health status, which implies constant inspection with regard to diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and others, requires the maintenance of a system of constant epidemiological vigilance and the capacity for attending immediately or rapidly to any incident in the field of veterinary health. The system calls for adequate human resources with salaries that cover overtime worked outside the regular timetable and also on non-working or rest days.
.From June , in the context of the trade union to which these workers belong, it was decided, as a union measure, to  work to rule'  i.e. according to the standard timetable of eight hours per day, in view of the lack of response from the ministerial authorities to the demands described above.
.The complainants indicate that on Sunday,  October , in the city of Artigas, the Animal Health Department received a notification of a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The veterinary technician therefore implemented the contingency plan established by the Ministry to respond to notifications of foot-and-mouth disease. On the morning of Monday,  October, the preliminary conclusion reached was that it was not an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease but of brucellosis, and this was subsequently confirmed by the results of the clinical analysis.
.In the context of the union measures adopted by the union leaders of the committee representing the animal health officials, Mr Martn Altuna, Mr Carlos Fuellis and Mr Guillermo Strasser, decided to issue a press release, which read as follows:The representative committee of animal health officials hereby states that at . hours today, Sunday  October, an animal health veterinary technician received notification of a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The animal health officials will attend to this suspected outbreak during their normal working hours, namely tomorrow Monday  October, leaving the office at . hours.This statement was published in various press outlets on the morning of Monday,  October.
.On  October , the Director-General of the Secretariat of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, exercising the powers delegated by the Minister, an agronomic engineer, decided to order the opening of proceedings for an administrative investigation. Section (VI) of the decision states that  the Minister, agronomic engineer Mr Ernesto Agazzi, requests the implementation of an administrative investigation in order to determine whether the erroneous statement was published by officials of this State Secretariat, since there would appear to be a violation in this case of section  of Act No. , as amended by section  of Act No. , which obliges ministry officials to maintain confidentiality with regard to any information obtained in the performance of their inspection duties'  enquiries having been received from international organizations and communication media.
.The administrative investigation concluded that there had been administrative misconduct on the part of the union leaders. The Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries therefore issued decisions dated  January  ordering administrative proceedings with respect to the three union leaders who issued the press release, together with preventive suspension from duty and withholding of  per cent of earnings. The investigative proceedings concluded with the issuing of the decisions of  June , which imposed a penalty on the union leaders ' .. for a period of  days with a corresponding loss of earnings, to be deducted from the period of preventive suspension served, on grounds of serious administrative misconduct' 
.The union measure adopted by the officers of the representative committee of animal health officials, the core group within the AFGAP, and supported and upheld as legitimate by the association and by all unionized officials of the core group, constitutes a union measure adopted as part of the exercise of the fundamental human rights of freedom of association and freedom of expression, established in articles  and , respectively, of the Constitution of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay and in ILO Conventions Nos ,  and .
.It goes without saying that if fundamental rights are to be effective, they must be closely interlinked, and consequently none of these rights can be exercised fully if there is no mutual co-existence with the others. This interrelationship between freedom of association and civil and political liberties was highlighted in the resolution of the th Session () of the International Labour Conference, concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties.
.The complainants state that in the present case the trade union leaders who were investigated and suspended from duty on a preventive basis, with the withholding of half their earnings, and subsequently penalized with a -day suspension with the corresponding loss of earnings, acted in the context of a dispute and in line with a union measure adopted by an assembly of the union, according to which the press was informed of the contradiction between the contractual conditions applying to officials of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries and the needs of the system. The decision of the assembly of  June , which was endorsed by the national assembly of officials on  July , held in the city of Durazno, consisted of not attending to suspected outbreaks of diseases outside the usual duty hours and informing the press of the contradiction between the",0,2010,Uruguay
26,"contractual conditions of work and the needs of the system.
.The decisions issued by the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, ordering disciplinary proceedings with suspension from duty of the union leaders concerned and concluding with decisions imposing a -day suspension with the corresponding loss of earnings, constitute a violation of ILO Conventions Nos ,  and .
.By a communication of  July , the PIT CNT, the COFE and the AFGAP state that the decisions imposing penalties on the union officers of the representative committee of animal health officials of the AFGAP, Mr Martn Altuna, Mr Carlos Fuellis and Mr Guillermo Strasser, were challenged through administrative appeals, submitted in due time and form, to have them overturned and referred to higher authority. The appeals were expressly rejected through the issuing of the respective decisions, and thus the administrative channels were exhausted, resulting in the judicial appeal for annulment being brought before the Administrative Disputes Tribunal.
.Trade union representative Mr Carlos Fuellis filed an appeal for annulment before the Administrative Disputes Tribunal against the Executive Authority ' Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, submitting the application in due time and form on  March , which was then classified as No. /. At present the case is at the evidentiary stage. In brief, the matter covered by the complaint was the subject of the abovementioned administrative appeals, filed by the three union representatives, and these were rejected. The appeal for annulment was filed only by union representative Mr Carlos Fuellis and is at present at the evidentiary stage.
.In its communication dated  November , the Government declares that, in the context of union measures implemented by officials of the Animal Health Division (DSA) of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, a notification was received on  October  at the Animal Health Department in the Department of Artigas concerning a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Accordingly, in the context of the union measure being implemented, it was decided to issue a press release, which read as follows:  The representative committee of animal health officials hereby states that at . hours today, Sunday  October, an animal health veterinary technician received notification of a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The animal health officials will attend to this suspected outbreak during their normal working hours, namely tomorrow Monday  October, leaving the office at . hours' 
.The Government points out that the above statement was published in various press outlets on the morning of Monday,  October . During the morning of the same day, the preliminary conclusion reached was that it was not an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease but of brucellosis, and this was subsequently confirmed by the clinical analysis.
.On  October  the Director-General of the Secretariat of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, exercising the powers delegated by the Minister, decided to order the opening of proceedings for an administrative investigation, with section (VI) of the decision stating as follows:  The Minister, agronomic engineer Mr Ernesto Agazzi, requests the implementation of an administrative investigation in order to determine whether the erroneous statement was published by officials of this State Secretariat, since there would appear to be a violation in this case of section  of Act No. , as amended by section  of Act No. , which obliges ministry officials to maintain confidentiality with regard to any information obtained in the performance of their inspection duties'  enquiries having been received from international organizations and communication media.
.The Government indicates that its primary considerations are set out below, with further comments to follow shortly. In examining the proceedings conducted by the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, the aspects mentioned by the PIT CNT, the COFE and the AFGAP were borne in mind and it was only after it was concluded that the actions deemed to be administrative misconduct were not covered by trade union immunity that the conditions were met for imposing the administrative penalty.
.The professional who conducted the administrative investigation stated clearly in her conclusions that she had investigated various aspects, including:  The existence of a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease'   delay in attending to a suspected case of foot-and-mouth disease'  and  finally, publication of the statement in public communication media'  The first two aspects, which were obviously very serious, were deemed not to constitute administrative misconduct that could be ascribed to the officials, but the third aspect was considered to fulfil the conditions for misconduct that could incur a penalty.
.Secondly, it should be pointed out that the conduct displayed by the officials was in clear violation of the terms of section  of Act No.  of  January , as amended by section  of Act No.  of  January , which states as follows:  Unless otherwise authorized explicitly in writing by the directors of the executive unit, officials of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries shall be obliged to maintain confidentiality with regard to any information obtained in the performance of their inspection duties. Furthermore, they shall maintain secrecy with regard to any administrative or judicial actions of which they have knowledge.' The aforementioned legal provision clearly prohibits officials from acting in the manner of the officials involved in the case in question, and this does not cease to apply despite claims of trade union immunity.
.The officials were informed of the report of the suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the performance of their inspection duties and therefore had no authority to divulge the news in the way they did. In similar situations, the Administrative Disputes Tribunal has evaluated the legality of the steps taken by the Administration, declaring explicitly that penalties imposed in accordance with the aforementioned legal provision do not conflict with the terms of ILO Conventions Nos ,  and . The Tribunal has maintained that the legal prohibition (section  of Act No. ) is very specific and legitimately limits rights which generally apply to every inhabitant of the country (articles , ,  and  of the Constitution of the Republic and provisions of the ILO Conventions having force of law).
.Finally, the Government points out that in the case in question the officials could have perfectly well asserted their rights and made a public statement, saying that a report had been received which would be attended to during their normal working hours, namely on Monday,  October . In this way their rights would not have been affected at all, particularly that of freedom of association, as highlighted by the resolution of the th Session () of the International Labour Conference, concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, including in particular those of freedom of opinion and expression and the right to hold opinions without being harassed and to investigate and receive information and disseminate it without any limitation on boundaries and by any means of expression. In the present case compatibility could very well have been established between trade union freedoms and compliance with national law, inasmuch as mentioning the type of suspected outbreak which had been reported did nothing to enhance the defence of union rights. It would have been perfectly possible to comply with the obligation to maintain confidentiality with regard to the information received in the course of duty and at the same time defend trade union rights.
.In its communication of  March  the Government reiterates that the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, before investigating the administrative proceedings, bore in mind the aspects relating to freedom of association and only after concluding that the actions deemed to be administrative misconduct were not covered by trade union immunity did it proceed accordingly.
.The Government adds that as regards the claims which lay behind the union measure adopted by the workers, of which inaccurate versions ended up in the public domain, it should be noted that the definition of the work regime in the DSA are the subject of analysis in the restructuring of the Directorate-General for Livestock Services (DGSG) of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, as are the scope of any agreements reached with the roundtable for dialogue held with the association of DGSG officials and the subsequent validation thereof. When the five-year budget for the DGSG was being drawn up, a proposal was made for a new work regime, in which the pay claims put forward by the officials of the DSA would be taken into consideration.
.As regards the pay structure, in the previous five-year period the following considerations were put forward: (a) to promote fair pay on the basis of guidelines laid down by the Ministerial Cabinet; (b) to increase the minimum pay levels for the lowest categories on the pay scale for officials; and (c) to improve pay for the categories carrying the greatest levels of responsibility in the department. Even though the DGSG has a problem in relation to pay inequalities between its divisions, the Administration intends to reduce differences during the five-year period on",1,2010,Uruguay
27,"the basis of the concept of equal pay for equal work. As regards biosecurity and personal protective equipment (PPE), major investments have been made in equipment for the protection of staff and biosecurity equipment has been distributed for use in health emergencies in all DSA areas and premises throughout the country. Training courses in various subjects for DGSG staff have been conducted, in which DSA officials have participated, on an exclusive basis in some and together with DGSG officials in others. Work is thus in progress and will continue in the future to take into consideration the demands of the officials of the State Secretariat referred to above.
.In view of the above, the Government reiterates that in the case in question the penalty imposed by the Administration did not violate trade union rights inasmuch as the legal provisions in force and especially those allegedly violated in the case in question did not harm basic guarantees in the area of freedom of association. Moreover, as regards the rights which deal with adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in relation to employment, it should be pointed out that in the present case there have been no acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Consequently, the Government declares that there has been no violation of ILO Conventions Nos ,  and , inasmuch as the penalties imposed on the officials of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries relate not to the trade union measures established but to failure to comply with a provision of national law (section  of Act No.  of  January , as amended by section  of Act No.  of  January ), and this in no way harmed trade union rights or civil liberties.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations allege that in the context of a dispute at the Animal Health Department of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries three trade union leaders of the representative committee of animal health officials in the AFGAP decided to issue a press release (mentioning that a notification had been received of a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease which would be attended to during normal working hours) and that as a result the administrative authority imposed a penalty on them of a -day suspension with loss of earnings.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () the press release in question was published in various media outlets on  October  and the same day it was concluded that it was not a case of foot-and-mouth disease but of brucellosis; () on  October it was decided to order the opening of administrative investigation proceedings to determine whether the erroneous news was published by officials of the Secretariat of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries since, if that was the case, there would be a violation of the provisions of section  of Act No. , which obliges Ministry officials to maintain confidentiality with regard to any information obtained in the performance of their inspection duties; () the professional who conducted the administrative investigation stated in her conclusions that she had investigated various aspects, including the publication of the news in the public communication media, and considered that the conditions had been fulfilled for misconduct liable to incur a penalty; () Act No.  prohibits officials from acting in the manner of the officials involved in the case, and those provisions do not cease to apply in spite of claims of trade union immunity, and only after it was concluded that the actions deemed to be administrative misconduct were not covered by trade union immunity were the conditions fulfilled for imposing the administrative penalty; () the officials noted the report of the suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the performance of their inspection duties and were therefore not authorized to divulge the news in the manner they did; () the Administrative Disputes Tribunal has evaluated the legality of the proceedings of the Administration, explicitly declaring that penalties imposed in conformity with the abovementioned legal provisions do not conflict with ILO Conventions Nos ,  and  and that the prohibition set out in section  is very specific and legitimately limits rights generally enjoyed by all inhabitants of the country; () the officials could very well have asserted their rights and issued a communication to the public, explaining that a report had been received which would be attended to during normal working hours, given that mentioning the type of suspected outbreak that had been reported did nothing to enhance the defence of trade union rights; and () the penalties imposed on the officials have nothing to do with the adopted trade union measures.
.The Committee notes all this information and in particular the Government s claim that the trade union leaders violated the provisions of the legislation relating to professional secrecy and the officials' duty of confidentiality. Moreover, the Committee observes the statement from the complainants that the three union leaders in question (Mr Martn Altuna, Mr Carlos Fuellis and Mr Guillermo Strasser) filed administrative appeals to have the decisions overturned and referred to higher authority which were expressly rejected and that only Mr Carlos Fuellis filed an appeal for annulment before the Administrative Disputes Tribunal against the Executive Authority (Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries) on  March , which is currently at the evidentiary stage.
.In view of the above, the Committee considers that the substance of the allegations in the present case is not related to the exercise of trade union rights, and it will therefore not pursue the examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",1,2010,Uruguay
28,".At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	With regard to the abovementioned Decree No.  of , which revoked two decrees, one which had been in force for over  years, which allowed the Ministry of the Interior to clear company premises which had been occupied by the workers, the Committee is of the view that the exercise of the right to strike and the occupation of the premises should respect the right to work of non-strikers, and the right of the management to enter its premises. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for these principles in regulatory legislation and practice.(b)	The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to take measures to amend Act No. , in order to give effect to the conclusions formulated in the foregoing paragraphs and to ensure full conformity with the principles of collective bargaining and the Conventions ratified by Uruguay on the subject.
.In a communication dated  February , the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), the Uruguayan Chamber of Industries (CIU) and the National Chamber of Commerce and Services of Uruguay (CNCS) state that, as regards the occupation of the premises, the Government failed to give effect to the Committee s recommendation, that this gave impetus to this type of practice and that the occupied companies had to turn to the judiciary in search of protection for the fundamental human rights denied to them by the Government. The complainants also indicate that, as regards Act No.  concerning collective bargaining, the delay in amending the law has the immediate consequence of creating legal uncertainty over any agreement concluded under the protection of a law that is being questioned by the employer sector as a whole, and they reiterate their position in the sense that the Government is required to amend the law in keeping with the Committee s observations.
.In its communications of  April and  November , the Government indicates that, in keeping with its practice of respecting the decisions of supervisory bodies, for more than two-and-a-half years it strove to find a consensus-based solution with the professional sectors in view of the comments made about different aspects of Act No. , that, cognizant of its obligations and responsibilities, it considers the prior consultation process with the social partners to have ended, and that it plans to send a bill aimed at settling this dispute to Parliament for consideration. As regards the occupation of the premises, the Government indicated that: () the rate of conflict in Uruguay is currently the lowest it has been over the last few years; () the referral to the courts of cases related to requests to clear the premises by non-strikers is indicative of the great importance attached to guaranteeing the freedom to work; () the judicial authorities have often ruled in favour of protecting the right to work of non-strikers and employers' rights by means of very short trials; and () it is clear that employers' constitutional rights are guaranteed by the State.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR), when examining the application of Conventions Nos  and  by Uruguay at its November December  meeting, referred to the issues being examined by the Committee relating to Act No.  concerning collective bargaining and to the occupation of company premises (the complainant organizations and the Government sent the same communications to the CEACR and to the Committee). The CEACR stated the following:The Committee notes with interest the decision to send a bill addressing the issues pending to Parliament with a view to overcoming the problems identified, and is pleased to learn that the bill will be sent to Parliament in November. The Committee hopes that the new law adopted will take full account of the principles and comments made. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any developments in that regard in its next report.The Committee also recalls that, on numerous occasions, it has underlined that  in so far as the strike remains peaceful, strike pickets and workplace occupations should be allowed. Restrictions on strike pickets and workplace occupations can only be accepted where the action ceases to be peaceful. It is however necessary in all cases to guarantee respect for the freedom to work of non-striking workers and the right of the management to enter the premises' (see General Survey on the fundamental Conventions concerning rights at work in light of the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization, , para. ). Under these circumstances, the Committee firmly hopes that in the course of the tripartite dialogue initiated, the necessary measures will be taken, taking into account the comments of the Committee on Freedom of Association and of this Committee, to ensure full respect for this principle in law and in practice, in consultation the most representative workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee suggests that the rulings of the national courts be taken into account during the consultation process already initiated.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that, in a communication dated  December , the Government states that, in keeping with the Committee s recommendations [see th Report, para. ] and following several consultations with the social partners, it promulgated Act No. , which, in its single article, provides for the replacement of article  of Act No. . Consequently, the Higher Tripartite Council will be composed of six delegates from the Executive, six delegates from the most representative employers' organizations, six delegates from the most representative workers' organizations and an equal number of substitutes from each party.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that, in a communication dated  March , the Government states that for more than two years it has been proposing to introduce a consensus-based reform of the Act concerning collective bargaining objected to by the complainant organizations, and that, given the lack of tangible results and in the interest of honouring the international obligations arising from the ILO Constitution, on  March , the Executive sent a bill amending Act No.  of  September  to Parliament. The Government adds that the provisions of the bill give effect to the recommendations made by the supervisory bodies.
.Lastly, in a communication dated  March , the IOE, CIU and CNCS allege that: () the consultations on the aforementioned bill sent to Parliament were ineffective and totally insufficient; () the aforementioned bill does not take account of the observations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in their totality, for which reason it is only a partial solution; and () the occupation of companies, which is never peaceful, is the main problem facing the employer sector in Uruguay and that the Government has yet to provide a solution to that problem (the complainants emphasize that, there is no right to strike in the ILO Conventions, and therefore such occupations must be considered illegitimate, if not illegal).
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations in relation to the allegations made by the complainant organizations on  March .
.Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments concerning the bill sent to Parliament, which seeks to amend Act No.  concerning collective bargaining, and to intensify social dialogue on the subject of the occupation of company premises.
.The Committee last examined the substance of this case at its March  meeting and on that occasion made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) With regard to the abovementioned Decree No.  of , which revoked two decrees, one which had been in force for over  years, which allowed the Ministry of the Interior to clear company premises which had been occupied by the workers, the Committee is of the view that the exercise of the right to strike and the occupation of the premises should respect the right to work of non-strikers, and the right of the management to enter its premises. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for these principles in regulatory legislation and practice.(b) The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to take measures to amend Act No. , in order to give effect to the conclusions formulated in the foregoing paragraphs and to ensure full conformity with the principles of collective bargaining and the Conventions ratified by Uruguay on the subject. The Committee requests to be kept informed in this regard.
.The Committee notes that the complainants, in their communication of  September , basically allege that the Government has not complied with the recommendations that were made in this case and request a direct contacts mission.
.The Committee notes that in its communications of  September and  November , the Government does not respond to that request, although, following a lengthy examination of the Committee s recommendations, it emphasizes that the",0,2009,Uruguay
29,"Committee had overlooked certain points and indicates that it has convened a meeting of the social interlocutors concerned, including the complainant organizations, in connection with the Collective Bargaining Act (No. ).
.In its communication dated  February , the Government declared that a tripartite commission took place on  February , where the parties discussed Act No.  and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security proposed to address the issues mentioned in the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association, following the consultation of the social partners who have accepted the creation of a tripartite commission. In this regard, it was agreed that the social partners would inform the Ministry of Labour on the integration of the delegations represented within ten days and that the Tripartite Commission should prepare a report within  days agreeing to submit to the Ministry a work schedule proposal containing the substantive issues mentioned in the aforementioned report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, without prejudice to other topics of interest to the Government and social partners in the field of labour politics and/or draft legislation.
.In these circumstances, while noting that the Government convened a tripartite meeting on  February , where the parties discussed Act No.  and agreed to create a tripartite commission that would prepare a report on the issues mentioned in the report of the Committee, the Committee requests the Government to agree to accept a mission. It is proposed that this case be further examined in the light of the report of such a mission.
.This complaint is contained in a communication dated  February  from the Uruguayan Chamber of Industries (CIU), the National Chamber of Commerce and Services of Uruguay (CNCS) and the International Organisation of Employers (IOE). Subsequently, the complainant organizations sent supplementary reports in a communication of  October .
.The Government sent its observations in communications of  December  and  January .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  February , the IOE, the CIU and the CNCS indicate that they have approached the Committee on Freedom of Association because the Government of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay has failed to fulfil the obligations that it assumed when it ratified Conventions Nos , ,  and . The complainant organizations consider that the Collective Bargaining Bill put before Parliament in October , item No.  of the Committee on Labour Legislation of the Chamber of Representatives File No.  of , contains provisions which violate the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions as is explained below.
.In addition, they consider it important to point out that the entire process of modification of labour legislation in Uruguay since  has taken place with total disregard for the opinions and contributions of the employers' side, and in the total absence of the social dialogue and tripartism which drives the International Labour Organization (ILO) and which are enshrined in Convention No.  and Recommendation No. .
.The CIU is the most representative employers' organization for the industrial sector in the country. It was formed in  with the objective of promoting the interests of national industry, defending its rights and stimulating the country s industrial growth. Its organization is profoundly democratic in structure. The country s most important industries, as well as smaller industrial workshops are represented in it. The CIU has always been concerned to maintain constant dialogue with the government authorities, seeking to ensure that the private and public sectors can work together with a common aim: peace, happiness and prosperity for all the country.
.The CIU s chief objectives, consistent with the paramount interests of the country and the Constitution of the Republic, are as follows: (a) to defend the rights and legitimate interests of national industry; (b) to stimulate the growth and improvement of industrial activity by all the means at its disposal; (c) to promote the creation and development of industrial enterprises and related services, providing employers with all possible technical tools and support services; (d) progressively to improve productivity and conditions of work; (e) to foster the internationalization of industrial enterprises; and (f) to encourage affiliation to the CIU of organizations with which it has shared objectives and interests.
.The CIU is composed of  trade organizations and over , affiliated companies. Together with the CNCS, the CIU is undoubtedly the most representative organization of the employers' side in Uruguay. It is a member of the IOE, the sole organization which represents employers' interests in the social and labour sphere internationally.
.The CNCS is the trade representative body of the Chamber of Trade, founded in , since when it has represented the commercial employers' side and more recently, the developing services sector. Currently, it has some , members and  trade organizations,  of which represent business interests within the country. It thus covers the entire territory of the Republic. The CNCS and the CIU are the two employers' institutions recognized by the ILO in Uruguay, and regularly attend its annual Conference.
.The complainant organizations consider that the Collective Bargaining Bill put before Parliament in October , item No.  of the Committee on Labour Legislation of the Chamber of Representatives File No.  of , contains provisions which violate the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions as is explained below. The complainants indicate that for greater clarity, they will divide their complaint into the various subjects concerned.
.The complainants indicate that Uruguay ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), in , the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), in . The complainants refer in chronological order to the process of the passing of the labour law reforms from  up to the present, culminating with the submission to Parliament of the Bill to create a system of collective bargaining to which we will refer.
.According to the complainant organizations, the Uruguayan Government, which took office on  March , embarked on a fundamental reform of labour law in total disregard for the business sector, total lack of consideration for the contributions of the sector, a total lack of recognition of employers' rights in a context where social dialogue and effective tripartite consultation was totally absent. It is against this background that they passed a series of laws which support this assertion and which are briefly described below:' Decree of the Executive Power, No. , dated  May , repeals Decree No.  of  October  and Decree No.  of  October , which allow the Ministry of the Interior through the police to remove workers from companies occupied by them. It should be emphasized that the said Decree was issued without any form of consultation, communication or notification of any kind or nature, amending laws which regulated that particular aspect which had been in force for  years. As explained below, this would bring about a true  state of defencelessness' of employers who were the subject of this unlawful measure taken by workers outside the clear and powerful constitutional provisions. Indeed, article  of the Constitution of the Republic enshrines the right to private ownership when it states that  the inhabitants of the Republic have the right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, honour, liberty, security, work and ownership'  Decree No. /, published in the Diario Oficial (Official Journal) on  May , orders the parties to a dispute to resort to law in that  the dispute between private individuals must be heard by the Judicial Power'  The preambular paragraphs of the Decree start from the false premise that all disputes or disputes of interest must be resolved in the courts although Uruguayan legislation itself recognizes compulsory prior conciliation through the administrative process in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. In addition, preambular paragraph III of the Decree in question provides that  it is pertinent to derogate the regulations concerned, in order that the interested parties may resort to the appropriate judicial process in order to preserve and guarantee the rights in question'  forgetting that there always was and remains the possibility of recourse to the courts to resolve a dispute between parties. In short, without achieving a consensus and betraying the tripartism much trumpeted by the Government, the applicable laws were changed after over  years without any kind of participation or effective consultation, and contributions were not sought from the employers' side. Furthermore, Decree No. / does not draw attention to the fact that it violates the Constitution when it grants primacy to the right to strike enshrined in article  over the right of ownership enshrined in article .' Act No. . Article  of Act No.  of",0,2009,Uruguay
30," December  (National Budget Act), submitted by the Government to Parliament and published in the Official Journal on  December , provides for the creation of the Register of Offending Companies in the ambit of the Inspectorate-General of Labour and Social Security (this Act was passed without any consultation with the employers' side).' Act No. . Act No. , published in the Official Journal on  January , set out trade union powers, deduction of trade unions dues, trade union leave and other workers' rights without setting out, or even contemplating, any of the employers' rights which the sector had claimed insistently (the brief consultations held were clearly intended to  legitimize' a decision that had already been taken by the Government).' Decree No. / of  March , published in the Official Journal on  March , regulates the provisions of Act No.  on trade union activity (the contributions and suggestions by the employers' side to which it refers were not taken into account in the content of the Decree).' Decree No. / of  August , published in the Official Journal on  August , which regulates the Register of Offending Companies created by Act No.  (without any prior consultation with the employers' side).' Act No. , published in the Official Journal on  January , which increases the prescription period for labour credits (without any prior consultation with the sector and at the same time as a committee was created and appointed by the Government to discuss labour matters).' Act No.  of  August , on filing of accounts and a budget report for the year , article  of which establishes the joint and several liability of owners, partners or directors or their legal representatives for breaches of safety and prevention rules, at the same time creating and appointing a committee with the Government to discuss the other subjects mentioned in the previous paragraph. Again, this is a case of another law passed without any regard for the opinion of the employers' side.' Act No.  of  December , referring to the subcontracting, and intermediation of labour in clear opposition to the proposal of the employers' side and without taking account of the views expressed.' Decree No. / published in the Official Journal on  August , regulating Convention No.  of the ILO, was issued in the face of the expressed opposition of the employers' side, which for many months had asked for various contributions to be taken into account but which were not included in the Decree.' Act No.  of  January , which amends Act No. . Yet again, this law was passed in the face of clear opposition to what had been requested by the employers' side, and did not include any significant contribution, as the consultations did not respect the principles which, according to the ILO, should govern them, that they should be effective and in good faith.' On  October , a bill was put before Parliament for the creation of a system of labour relations and collective bargaining without any kind of prior consultation and containing provisions in clear violation of Conventions Nos ,  and , as will be explained below.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the Government had been characterized by the casual and ineffective convocation for the formation of certain forums of a tripartite character, in which the employers' side was represented, in the ever vain hope that their contributions would be heard and respected. Far from that, the impact of the employers' side in the formation of laws was and is null. These forums or committees do not take any heed of the aspirations of the sector nor the rights of employers. Thus they create inequity, arbitrariness and consequently a dangerous imbalance in the system. In consequence, they regret to observe a lack of genuine social dialogue and effective tripartite consultations in Uruguay, despite constant efforts and interest expressed in recent years by the complainant chambers to strengthen relations and collaboration with the Government.
.The list of legislation introduced by this administration and the fundamental changes to labour law and labour relations involved make effective tripartite consultation a vital necessity. The complainant organizations assert and provide evidence that in Uruguay there has been limited dialogue in the convening and holding of meetings which do not seek to reach agreements or accept contributions. They state that in many cases, the invitation to consultations is sent only  hours in advance, based on working papers previously prepared by the Government, with no real prospect, for the employers' side, of analysing it thoroughly, consulting and introducing suggestions and contributions. In short, the legislation described, which involves enormous changes, was introduced without due and proper consultation with the employers' side.
.The complainants indicate that they have repeated on many occasions that it was necessary to create a proper system of labour relations. However, the Government persisted in the dangerous idea of generating a series of isolated, disorganized, general laws, and thereby generated legal uncertainty which is directly prejudicial to the employers. Moreover, it seeks to regulate only certain partial aspects of labour relations, giving rights to only one of the parties, the workers, while ignoring employers' rights.
.Since the Government, on  March , communicated its intention to make fundamental labour reforms, the business chambers appearing here have been at all times ready to engage in serious, productive and effective dialogue, in order that the prospective legislation would reflect the aspirations of the social partners on an equitable basis, balancing the rights of the workers and those of the employers. In this regard, and in principle, there was a clear interest in complying with article  of the Constitution which recognizes and declares that trade unions have the right to strike, establishing the law that will regulate the exercise of that right.
.The Collective Bargaining Bill sent to the national Parliament by the Government deserves special attention. In general, and as will be explained, if the Bill becomes law, companies' powers of organization and management will be compromised, efficiency and productivity will be affected together with the industrial fabric, without any benefit to the workers. As mentioned above, the Bill was not offered to the employers' organizations for consideration or tripartite consultation, thus violating the fundamental principles of the ILO.
.According to the complainants, and as shown by the statement in support of the Bill sent to Parliament, it is intended to create a  national collective bargaining system'  In consequence, it is highly significant that the law itself refers to matters such as the  express omissions'  which shows Uruguay as a country governed by minimal regulation of collective labour law. The justification states that  Collective labour relations, in the traditional sense, form a triad composed of the trade union, collective bargaining and disputes'  Yet, while the Bill says nothing about the first pillar of this triad, it does talk about collective bargaining and disputes. Thus it is clear that the objective of the law is to regulate collective bargaining and disputes, but not the third component of the  triad' that it mentions, namely, the trade union. This leads to an imbalance to the direct detriment of the employers.
.As described, the law which seeks to create a  system' says nothing concerning protection of the right of ownership, which includes the right to ownership of the means of production and especially the product of the activity of the factors involved in the process. It makes no mention of protection of the company s assets. It omits to refer to the freedom of trade and industry which includes the freedom to form a company, and the right of an employer to organize and manage which implies, in turn, the right to manage the company and the right to make changes. It said nothing about the right to safeguard employers' interests against measures which are not covered by the right to strike. The law says nothing about the rights and obligations of organizations or the responsibilities of organizations or their representatives.
.It does not contain provisions on the system for adopting decisions in disputes or the corresponding obligation of liability for damages and injuries caused by breach of agreements. It says nothing about the duty of peace, prior notice of the adoption of certain measures, nor the right to work of those workers who are not in agreement with the adoption of certain measures. In short, it seeks to create a system which fails to fulfil the constitutional requirement set out in article  of the Constitution of the Republic which requires regulation of the exercise of the right to strike. Moreover, it states in the justification that  the intention of the Bill is to create legislation which puts in the hands of the actors in labour relations a series of procedures to allow bargaining'  but it does not seem reasonable to believe that articles '  permit or allow the possibility of bargaining.",0,2009,Uruguay
31,"They do not believe that a violation of the right of ownership  permits or allows the possibility of' bargaining.
.The Bill contains a Chapter I concerning  Fundamental principles and rights of the collective bargaining system'  This chapter is nothing more than a mere declaration of principles without the least basis in fact as stated above and which will be duly supported by evidence. Article  of the Bill, when it provides for the  obligation to bargain in good faith'  establishes that  the parties must also exchange the necessary information to allow the normal conduct of the collective bargaining process. In the case of confidential information, the communication thereof carries with it the implicit obligation of secrecy'  The complainants consider that this article alters the necessary balance between the parties.
.The fact is that it contains the express wording  obligation of information'  Notwithstanding that this was part of an agenda for discussion and bargaining which was coordinated with the Government, it introduces this aspect in the Bill, forgetting that this obligation to bargain in good faith and to provide information is only possible if the parties are structured in a transparent and regulated organization for the reasons which will be explained below.
.The complainants indicate that most of a company s information is confidential, since from it can be inferred the strategic plans it has drawn up to market its products or services. It is not possible to guarantee the  obligation of secrecy' which the law imposes if the trade union cannot be held liable in law for breach or non-fulfilment of this obligation. As the right to strike as set out in article  of the Constitution is not regulated in domestic law, it is not possible to guarantee that workers will comply with obligations, since the trade union does not have legal personality and thus does not exist in law. In consequence, it is not possible to hold workers or the trade union responsible in the event of breach of the  obligation of secrecy'  In a nutshell, under the Bill, the employer is not guaranteed either compliance, or remedy or compensation or even the certainty of being able to take legal action to remedy any possible injury.
.Chapter II of the Bill creates a body which, according to the complainants, warrants serious criticism in that it violates one of the guiding principles of tripartism and fundamentally alters the necessary balance between the parties by creating dangerous imbalances which undermine a healthy system of labour relations. It creates the Higher Tripartite Council as the  body for the coordination and governance of labour relations'  It will be composed of  nine delegates of the Executive Power, six delegates of the most representative employers' organizations and six delegates of the most representative workers' organizations'  The composition of this Council is seriously questioned for several reasons.
.In the first place, as set out in the preambular paragraphs of the Bill sent to Parliament, it is granted wide powers, to the extent that it may  consider and pronounce on questions related to tripartite and bipartite bargaining (article , paragraph (d)). Thus, the Council, placed at the head of the system, must have an overall view of the phenomenon of collective bargaining in all its dimensions'  This clearly shows that the Council will have to be established as the governing body in collective bargaining in all its dimensions, overlooking the fact that, by definition, collective bargaining is bipartite, free and voluntary. In this, the Bill demonstrates a marked  interventionist and dirigiste' vision of labour relations. There is no doubt that interventionism by the Government in labour relations, as contemplated in the Bill, not only does not foster free and voluntary collective bargaining thereby violating Conventions signed by the country, but also has a serious impact on the autonomy of the social partners in collective bargaining.
.The complainants maintain that the powers assigned to this body violate the principle of employers' freedom of action, as it allows the Government to  pronounce' without having been requested or asked by them to do so. Secondly, the Government, through its representatives, has more votes than the social partners, nine in total, while the employers and workers each have six.
.Even more significant, however, is that the law allows the Council to deliberate  in advance' on the  establishment, application and modification of the national minimum wage and that determined for sectors of activity which cannot fix them through collective bargaining' (article , Powers, paragraph (a)). Worded in this way, the power might be seen as vague and imprecise and thus diffuse and unlimited. Despite the foregoing, a reading of it leaves no room for two opinions. It implies that the Government s interventionism and dirigisme will cover the fixing of wages in any sector of activity where an agreement is not reached in bipartite collective bargaining. Collective bargaining will not be free and voluntary, as it will be conducted under the threat enshrined in this article. In short, the Government is endowing itself with an arbitration mechanism which substitutes tripartite bargaining for bipartite, as a mechanism prior to direct intervention by the Government in collective bargaining between the company and its workers.
.Furthermore, this pronouncement of the Council, composed as it is of a larger number of government representatives, alters the balance between the parties and transforms it in practice into compulsory arbitration on questions from which the Government should remain totally aloof.
.Chapter III of the abovementioned Bill provides that collective bargaining may take place in wages councils which may be convened by the Executive Power  ex officio or mandatorily at the request of the organizations representative of the activity sector concerned' (article , Powers, second paragraph). This article, like those mentioned above, is in clear violation of the principle of free and voluntary bargaining set out in the relevant Conventions and the many pronouncements of the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In other words, the convening and establishment of the wages council at the request of the workers or the Government itself, given the greater number of members on the Government side and the possibility that the Council can decide by majority vote, transforms collective bargaining into compulsory arbitration. It is crystal clear that Article  of Convention No.  refers to free and voluntary negotiation and excludes coercion, and that the Committee on Freedom of Association has considered that for collective bargaining to be effective, it must be voluntary in character.
.Wages councils as they operate in Uruguay and as they are intended to be regulated in the Bill have been in clear violation of the Conventions concerned. The Government has played an interventionist and dirigiste role in collective bargaining, forgetting that the Committee has established that the sole and mere intervention of one representative of the public authority simply in the drafting of collective agreements, if not confined to a merely technical assistance role, cannot be reconciled with the spirit of Article  of Convention No. .
.Chapter IV concerning bipartite collective bargaining also warrants serious objections and we regard them, too, as clearly in violation of the abovementioned Conventions. The complainants consider that the Bill in question contains very considerable defects which should be addressed: deficit of representativeness, adaptability and legal certainty. Article  provides that ' .. in company collective bargaining, in the absence of a workers' organization, bargaining authority shall pass to the most representative higher level organization ...'  It is possible that ' .. the absence of an organization (with all that the word entails) does not mean the absence of collective relations within the company ...'  Moreover, the organization of the branch of activity may ' .. be representative and strong at branch level but not present at company level ...'  The Bill gives precedence to the hierarchical principle and this, in the opinion of Professor Prez del Castillo which we fully share ' .. conspires against the function of the collective agreement as a  bespoke suit' for which the rules are made ...'  He maintains that the higher level may be an average of the companies of which it is composed, but it is ' .. very different at the specific lower level of a given company'  We agree that the proposed law sidelines the  represented collective interest' 
.Moreover,  administrative checks to test representativeness and consultation' are missing from the Bill in question. The lack of adaptability refers to the impossibility under the Act concerning the ineffectiveness of a legal provision which prevents an agreement being a true  bespoke suit'  The deficit of legal certainty refers to the idea ' .. we are provided with a rapid legal process for failure to fulfil the obligations assumed under the Convention, peace clauses, breach of confidentiality of information, settlement of disputes on questions of representativeness ...'  and this leaves serious gaps in a bill on which there was a lack of",0,2009,Uruguay
32,"consultation.
.When it refers to the duration of the collective agreement in its article , the Bill provides that  a collective agreement whose term has expired shall remain fully in force with respect to all its clauses until substituted by a new agreement'  In this regard, we must recall that, as the Committee has said, any extension of collective agreements should be following tripartite analysis of the ensuing consequences for the sector to which it applies.
.As regards Chapter V on prevention and settlement of disputes, the complainants state that articles '  are clearly in violation of international Conventions signed by Uruguay (these articles refer to the occupation of the workplace during a strike; these articles were withdrawn by the Government).
.The complainant organizations indicate that, in short, the Bill does not enshrine a system, but a set of laws which partially regulate certain aspects in favour of only one of the parties. They assert that the Bill in question contains deliberate omissions: it regulates only workers' rights, but does not subject them to obligations of any nature or kind, it does not refer to employers' rights, it gives legal status to a manifestly unlawful action which violates rights enshrined in the Constitution, and it confers on the Executive Power a maximum degree of intervention in collective bargaining between employers and workers. All of this ultimately gives rise to dangerous imbalances in the system, and one-sided and thus arbitrary solutions. In conclusion, the complainants consider that the Government is acting on the fringes of what is lawful in contravention of the provisions of the international Conventions to which it is a party, namely Conventions Nos , ,  and .
.In their communication of  October , the complainant organizations report the approval on  August  by the national Parliament, of the Collective Bargaining Act, which is the subject of this case. They draw the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association to the failure by the Government of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay to fulfil the obligations it assumed when it ratified Conventions Nos , ,  and , by passing the Bill which is the subject of the case.
.The complainants state that the recently passed Act, despite certain specific changes introduced in it, is in flagrant breach of the international Conventions signed by Uruguay. They state that, as has been explained, there were no  discussions' that were  free'   detailed'  in  good faith'  in a  framework of trust' and  mutual respect' with  sufficient time to express their points of view and discuss them in depth with a view to reaching a satisfactory compromise' 
.The Bill passed by Parliament and promulgated by the Executive Power as Act No.  enshrines direct intervention by the Government in collective bargaining in accordance with the articles described below. Article  of the Act creates the Higher Tripartite Council as the  body responsible for the coordination and governance of labour relations'  With regard to its composition, the Act provides that the Council shall consist of nine delegates of the Executive Power, six of the most representative employers' organizations and six of the most representative workers' organizations.
.According to the complainants, the above warrants the following considerations. Firstly, it is a body which will interfere directly ( coordination and governance'  in the principal aspect of labour relations, which is collective bargaining. Secondly, the greater number of delegates from the Executive Power ensures that, in nominal voting, decisions will be in accordance with the interests and vision of the Government. Indeed, article  establishes an absolute majority of members, in which the sectors do not have equal representation with the Government. This is unquestionably a violation of tripartism, the guiding principle of the ILO.
.One of the most worrying aspects for the complainant organizations, however, is that the Council has an ex officio power of convocation which allied to the quorum, transforms it into a powerful executing agency of the policies which the Government wishes to implement. Notwithstanding the above, special attention should be paid to article  which refers to the powers of the Council. The complainant organizations indicate that special consideration should be given to paragraphs (d) and (e). Indeed, paragraph (d) provides that the Council s powers will include  to consider and pronounce on questions relating to tripartite and bipartite bargaining levels'  In addition, paragraph (e) provides that it may  study and adopt initiatives on subjects which it considers pertinent to promote consultation, bargaining and the development of labour relations' 
.The concern of the complainant organizations is that the new body will be able to decide on any question related to bargaining levels and adopt initiatives to develop labour relations. As conceived, with the ex officio right of convocation, the greater number of delegates of the Executive Power, nominal voting, and powers defined in a broad, ambiguous, confused and ill-defined manner, this is undoubtedly a case of a body whose objective is clear: state intervention and dirigisme in labour affairs and collective bargaining. It thereby violates the autonomy of the actors and parties and the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. . In a nutshell, moreover, the provisions of the abovementioned articles are contrary to the many pronouncements of the Committee on Freedom of Association which establish that public authorities must refrain from interfering to limit the right of the parties to free negotiation.
.Article  of the Act provides that  a collective agreement whose term has expired shall remain fully in force with respect to all its clauses until substituted by a new agreement'  It is clear from this that it establishes a compulsory extension of the term of collective agreements, which is an interference in free collective bargaining. In article , when it refers to tripartite wages councils, whose functioning, according to a report of the Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference , has been the subject of observation, it provides that  decisions of wages councils shall take effect for the respective group of activity once they have been registered and published by the Executive Power'  The requirement of publication for an agreement to enter into force is not fully in conformity with the principles of voluntary negotiation established in Convention No. , as the Committee has stated clearly.
.Most importantly, however, is that this Act ultimately enshrines something that was precisely a reason for observation by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in  when it examined the application by Uruguay of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). According to the complainants, the observation of the Committee of Experts acquires special relevance since it was in response to the considerations of the Government itself. In short, the Act ultimately enshrines intervention and interference by the public authorities in clear violation of the abovementioned international Conventions. In conclusion, according to the complainant organizations, the Collective Bargaining Act passed by the national Parliament constitutes a violation of those Conventions.
.In its communication of  December , the Government states that it must respond to the complainant proceeding filed by the IOE, the CIU and the CNCS for alleged violations of Conventions Nos , ,  and . The Government states that the focus of the complaint is linked to the Collective Bargaining Bill submitted by the Executive Power to the national Parliament and that the complainant organizations consider that the process of amending Uruguayan labour legislation, which began in , took place with total disregard of the employers' sector or their contributions, and thus in an absence of tripartism and social dialogue.
.The Government states that it will demonstrate the lack of justification of the action, and the eventual benefits of the Bill which, as is natural in any democratic process, was subject to countless amendments from its submission to its final approval by the national Parliament, which is a crucible of all the political forces in the country and where the various sectors were invited to expound their positions.
.The Government indicates that, before analysing the Bill, a clarification must be made which the complainants omitted to mention. Namely, the President of the Republic gave an undertaking to the employers' sector and the public (in that it was communicated to the press) to withdraw articles ' ; i.e. those which referred to occupation of workplaces, from the original Bill. In addition, the Minister of Labour and Social Security conveyed that decision on more than one occasion to the parliamentary authorities (Committee on Labour Legislation of the Chamber of Deputies), several meetings with employers and the press in general. Consequently, the employers (by which we mean exclusively the CIU and the CNCS) should not have omitted to mention that information to the Committee. It does not seem an appropriate practice for a proceeding governed by principles so dear to democratic institutions and justice as good faith and fairness.
.In",0,2009,Uruguay
33,"domestic law, which obviously does not bind the Committee but which reflects a tradition or part of the cultural heritage of our country, paragraph  of article  of the General Procedures Code states:  Good faith and fairness ' the parties, their representatives or assistants and, in general all participants in the proceedings, shall suit their conduct to the dignity of the law, the respect due to the litigants and fairness and good faith'  In consequence, any allusion to the aforementioned articles by the employers' sector masks a spurious intent which may possibly confuse the Committee, therefore we shall make no reference to those articles or any comment thereon by the complainants.
.Secondly, the Government reiterates its assertions in the first paragraph of this reply, namely that the employers formulated a complaint on a bill, in the drafting of which they were invited to participate as in the case of all the other bills to amend the labour system. However, as will be shown below, they initially took part in the process and then, voluntarily, withdrew. The original Bill, submitted to a bicameral parliamentary process, was subject to many changes (including some suggested by the employers themselves) and the Bill (annexed) was passed. The complainants then added new arguments, taking positions at one time or another which contradicted each other and abusing the procedural process in the case. For all these reasons, the Government requests the Committee s indulgence when considering this reply, which is due to the confusion introduced into the proceedings by the other side.
.The Government indicates that it will try to set out its reply in a logical order following the initial list suggested by the employers' organizations, following the numbering of the chapters in their submission.
.With regard to Chapter I which refers to the background of the complainant employers' bodies (setting out their history and action from their perspective), the Government emphasizes that these are not the only employers' organizations in the country. For example, there is the Rural Association of Uruguay which is not represented by any of these associations, the construction industry chambers, etc. Chapter II sets out the subject of the complaint which, as mentioned above, is based on the assertion that the Bill concerned would (in the opinion of the employers) contravene certain international labour Conventions, and that the employers were not involved in the process prior to the adoption of laws passed since . In Chapter III, they identify the ILO Conventions ratified by the country which the employers' organizations allege were violated by the Collective Bargaining Bill.
.As regards Chapter IV, the Government states that in , when the present administration took office, the Uruguayan labour scene was dismal. Minimum wages were at levels which were frankly appalling, collective bargaining hardly existed, freedom of association was constantly suppressed, affiliation rates both in the workers' and employers' sectors were at alarming levels. With respect to the treatment of the national minimum wage, the Government suggests that reference should be made to the observation of the Committee of Experts in  and  concerning the application by Uruguay of Convention No. .
.With regard to the trend in real wages, the reality under the economic policies applied since the s shows that of the , private sector workers in the country at that time, only . per cent had collective bargaining. Moreover, from the wages point of view, up to , real wages grew by only . per cent in seven years. Up to , they stagnated, and then in the last two years there was a very sharp fall. Trade unionism, without any kind of promotion, in contravention of article  of the Uruguayan Constitution, had collapsed to not more than  per cent of all employed workers.
.According to the Government, the legislation contained flagrant contraventions of international labour Conventions. For example, rural workers or domestic workers did not have a limited working day nor the right to bargaining in wages councils. Those bodies were not convened after , and the country was under constant observation by the ILO supervisory bodies for failure to comply with Convention No. . There were less than  company-only collective agreements which covered less than  per cent of the total workforce. Data provided by the Documentation and Records Division in the National Directorate of Labour show that: in ,  collective agreements were registered; in ,  such instruments; in ,  agreements were registered; in ,  agreements were registered; and in ,  collective agreements.
.As regards protection of freedom of association ' a fundamental human right ' a trade union official or militant could be dismissed without the right to reinstatement. The Committee on Freedom of Association had referred to this matter. As regards one of the pillars of the present complaint, there was no social dialogue or tripartism, which is now demanded so stridently by the employers' sector, in disregard of the position before . Minimum wages, with the exception of the national minimum wage which was set at a shameful level, were set by the market, although that market was marked by high unemployment (note that between ' , unemployment was above  per cent in the open market) and the abundant informal work (estimated in those years at around  per cent).
.In  and , numerous collective agreements were signed on terms which diminished workers' rights and in contempt for them. When the new Government took office in , one of its first measures was to re-establish wages councils. For  years (from  to ), these bodies had not been convened, despite the fact that the Act which created them (Act No.  of ) was fully in force. Despite that, the employers' side never formulated a complaint based on the failure to convene those bodies. The reason is obvious. The employers today are still promoting a policy of deregulation and impoverishment of workers' wages and conditions of work. What are the powers of these councils? In principle, they can be described as tripartite bodies (employers, workers and the State) whose chief responsibility is to set minimum wages by branch of activity and category.
.They also have other powers such as to act as conciliation bodies in the case of collective disputes, fix wage increases for the remaining workers, etc. As a first step, the Higher Tripartite Council was set up, with the participation of the three sectors (note the broad social dialogue), in which it was unanimously agreed how those bodies would function. Twenty activity groups were organized which in turn, internally, also by consensus of the three sectors, established subgroups. The latter now far exceed  (due to the particular characteristics of the rural sector, a similar council was created at the same time which created three groups and several subgroups).
.Similarly, a framework for discussion was established in the public sector, which reached a framework agreement and by consensus a law on collective bargaining for the public sector (which is also annexed to this reply) and which has a certain similarity to that of the private sector. Finally, a wages council was set up for domestic or homeworkers, leading to a collective agreement which is in force until next year.
.Three bargaining rounds took place: the first in  which resulted in  per cent of collective agreements being adopted unanimously or by a majority. The second took place in , which brought the level of agreements to . per cent and the third in , with agreement in  per cent of cases. It should be noted that in all cases, over  per cent of collective agreements were reached unanimously. The Government states that this shows the promotion by the Government of broad tripartism, as well as a policy based on the fullest social dialogue, which not only took place in relation to minimum wages and the National Directorate of Labour, but also extended on a cross-cutting basis to the basic spheres of the Inspectorate-General of Labour and Social Security (creating tripartite committees to implement the provisions of Convention No. ), the National Employment Directorate (creating the National Institute of Employment and Vocational Training, also with tripartite composition), the National Social Security Directorate (where there was national social dialogue on social security leading to agreement on reform of unemployment insurance and better access to pensions) and the National Audit Office.
.Mention should also be made of a significant growth in real wages, which rose on average by over  per cent, according to data provided by the National Statistical Institute. This was accompanied by a fall in unemployment to levels which, according to the latest measurement for these years, was around . per cent, one of the lowest levels since this indicator has been measured, and below the country s structural unemployment. As a consequence, the level of informal work in the labour market has declined to around  per cent. Today over ,, workers pay social security contributions and for the first time ever, the pensions institute",0,2009,Uruguay
34,"showed surpluses in both  and . In the legislative sphere, several laws related to the world of work and social security have been passed. In particular, due to their importance, it is worth highlighting the following: (a) Act on the promotion and protection of trade union activity (its adoption was crucial in the context of promoting collective bargaining); (b) two laws on subcontracting or outsourcing of corporate services; (c) the new Act on homeworkers and domestic service; (d) the Act limiting the working day of rural workers; (e) laws on special licences; (f) the Unemployment Insurance Reform Act; (g) the Collective Bargaining (Public Sector) Act; and (h) the Act on reform of the labour process.
.The Government indicates that it has pursued a policy of democratizing social dialogue in all possible areas, including social security, based on the purest of tripartism. Negotiating on a tripartite basis in good faith does not necessarily mean achieving unanimity or consensus. Of course, unanimity or consensus is the ideal, but it presupposes that each social interlocutor is prepared to give and take. If one of the parties to the negotiation resorts to a systematic strategy of refusing any kind of reform, it means that the rest of the sectors involved can decide the matter by majority. The pursuit of social consensus cannot be allowed to hold up, let alone block, the reforms needed by the country to continue its progress.
.Moreover, several political parties of all philosophical persuasions of the Uruguayan social spectrum are represented in the national Parliament, the natural body where proposed laws are sent for discussion and approval. This means that if discussions in pursuit of consensus are exhausted, the Bill is sent to the legislative body and each professional group is heard.
.The Government indicates that with respect to the reiterated theme of occupations, articles '  of the initial Bill (relating to the subject of occupations) were withdrawn by express order of the President of the Republic himself, after being requested to do so by the employers. This is another example where the employers' voice was again heard by the Government.
.The Government states that  is an election year in Uruguay and that, for this reason, the complaint seems to be framed as a political statement rather than a complaint against a bill. Indeed, a variety of statements are formulated which will be inclined to confuse the Committee on Freedom of Association. The Government states that authentic tripartism and social dialogue have been established in the country and that the complainant s assertions to the contrary depart from the facts. The Government makes reference to certain spheres of social dialogue, tripartism and collective bargaining created since  March , the date when the Government took office: re-establishment of wages councils (considered by the doctrinaire as a fundamental instrument, perhaps the most important, of participation and social dialogue in Uruguay, since it has the potential to function as a mechanism for governing the system of labour relations); the so-called space for social dialogue, the Compromiso Nacional; the launching of the National Economic Council; and the tripartite membership of the following bodies: the Committee on the Eradication of Child Labour (chaired by the Inspectorate-General of Labour), the Equality and Gender Commission (which functions in the National Directorate of Labour), the Occupational Safety and Health Commission (chaired by the Inspectorate-General of Labour), the Committee on Classification and Grouping of Labour Activities (chaired by the National Directorate of Labour), the Tripartite Committee for the Construction Industry (chaired by the Inspectorate-General of Labour), the Construction Workers Unemployment and Pension Fund (chaired by the National Directorate of Labour), the Tripartite Committee for the Metal Industry (chaired by the Inspectorate-General of Labour and Social Security), the Tripartite Committee for the Shipping Industry (which has issued orders based on consensuses reached in its deliberations), the Tripartite Committee for the Dairy Industry (also chaired by the Inspectorate-General of Labour), the Tripartite Committee for the Chemical Industry (also chaired by the Inspectorate-General of Labour), the Tripartite Committee for the Regulation of Convention No. , and the National Dialogue on Social Security which ended with agreement between the three parties. Many of these spheres enjoy or have enjoyed support or technical assistance from the ILO itself.
.The employer sector has always been heard. It should be noted that in a climate of protection of social dialogue, and so much effective tripartism, it is impossible that some of their positions would not have been taken into account and it is reasonable to think and easy to demonstrate that in some matters they have imposed their points of view. Not in vain, either, as in the case of wages, over  per cent of the activities arrived at collective agreements unanimously. This is indisputable evidence that defies argument. The agreements mentioned are published in the Official Journal and posted on the Ministry s web site. The Government adds that what happened is that in Uruguay from  to , there was hardly any social dialogue, because state labour relations policy was to do nothing. At that time, the workers were never in a position of parity to demand improvements from the employers' sector.
.The Government also indicates that it observes a constant negative attitude on the employers' side on the majority of subjects proposed for social dialogue. If it was a negative attitude in that they offered other alternatives, it would help to enrich the instrument. However, in many cases, it was a negative attitude without a counter-proposal, or even unjustified. The Government maintains that it shows recklessness on their part to assert that the labour laws passed were not the product of social dialogue. The IOE, the CIU and the CNCS mention in their complaint a long list of laws and decrees where they were apparently not heard. The Government states that this is not true, as they are always heard; committees are set up, generally in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and they are received in parliamentary circles. That is, not to mention the many requests for interviews and exchanges of views with the Minister himself and other officials of the Secretariat of State.
.The Government indicates that the employer sector was heard in the process prior to the passing of Act No.  on Freedom of Association and Laws for its Protection; the passing of the laws on subcontracting and outsourcing; the passing of the laws on special licences; and the passing of Act No.  on Prescription of Labour Credits. The Government maintains that opening a space for social dialogue, tripartism or collective bargaining does not necessarily require reaching an agreement. They will make every effort to do so, but when they fail, if there is partial consensus, the laws are put before Parliament with those partial agreements.
.The Government states that the Bill was drafted on the basis of many contributions from highly qualified experts, some of them working for the Executive Power, others as parliamentarians or as parliamentary advisers, practising lawyers, officials of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. At the time when the Bill was being drafted, none of those who participated could fail to take into account the recommendations of the ILO mission which visited the country in November . The Executive Power was not, and is not, unaware that collective labour law is based on three pillars: the trade union, collective bargaining and the right to strike. This Bill does not seek to regulate those three pillars, but only to regulate one of them: collective bargaining. The complaint submitted omits to mention, maybe voluntarily, that freedom of association was regulated by Act No.  by this very administration, after lengthy discussion, in which the employers opposed its regulation. This absence of regulation meant that the country was continually questioned by the ILO itself, since there were no mechanisms to generate stability for trade union officials or militants, and no action for reinstatement was available.
.The system thus refers to one of the pillars, collective bargaining, those subject to it, organizational levels, purpose, etc. It does not talk of strikes or trade unions. There was originally a chapter on mechanisms for ending the occupation of companies, but the President of the Republic himself, as well as the Minister of Labour and Social Security, undertook before the employers themselves, the public and the parliamentary committees, that that aspect of the Bill would be dropped, and that can be seen in Act No.  which was finally passed. It is therefore reiterated that the Bill refers only to collective bargaining. The Government therefore wonders why this Bill should have anything to say about protection of the right of ownership. That right is enshrined in the Constitution and the law, and its protection is essentially entrusted to the Judicial Power. It also wonders why it must refer to freedom of commerce and industry, when that is also supported by the Constitution and the law.
.The Government reiterates that the Act left out the articles which sought to regulate occupations, it did not",0,2009,Uruguay
35,"regulate the right to strike and, even less, measures which in the opinion of the national employers should not be covered by it. If the workers adopt this type of measure, the employers must take action before the judicial authority and it will be that authority, and that alone, which will determine whether or not it is a case of the right to strike. They must not complain to the administrative authority, which is not competent in the matter. However, the Bill and the current Act regulate a system of collective bargaining, indicating how the institutions, of which it is made up, are structured.
.The Government indicates that the Bill contains a model which refers to collective bargaining, not the responsibility of the parties involved (whether workers or employers). This means that if it is a company, a group of companies, or one or more employers organizations' that fail to comply with the agreement, it does not regulate their responsibility. That is not the purpose of the Act. In the latter case, it would be the subject of an act which regulates the life of trade organizations (whether workers' or employers' , and that was not, and is not, the purpose of the Bill.
.The Government also maintains in relation to the assertion that ' .. it does not seem reasonable to believe that articles '  permit or allow the possibility of bargaining, that it does not believe that a violation of the right of ownership  ermits or allows the possibility of' bargaining'  The Government reiterates that the articles which are alluded to were excluded from the Bill a long time ago by order of the President of the Republic and are not included in the Act that was passed.
.The Government indicates that it is proposed to analyse in rather more depth the content of the Act that was passed. The Act follows the changes that occurred in the practice of wages councils since , reorganizing them and adding certain innovative solutions. It is structured in six chapters. The first refers to the fundamental principles and rights of the collective bargaining system, essentially based on Recommendations Nos  and  of the ILO. Chapters II and III set out the model of collective bargaining by branch of activity, which continues to be centralized up to the present. It basically amends certain key articles of Act No. . Chapter IV is devoted to bipartite bargaining, i.e. classic collective bargaining by a company or group of companies. Chapter V introduces clauses for the prevention and settlement of collective disputes, which are not contained in current practice and the present powers of the National Directorate of Labour and the wages councils established in article  of the original Act No. . Lastly, Chapter IV, which is the product of a last-minute political agreement, which was the subject of serious criticisms both by the trade unions and labour law doctrine, appears without a name, and refers to the peace clauses to be included in collective agreements.
.The system is structured at three levels. The first has national or general scope, the second is branch of activity or productive chain and, finally, the last consists of the classic bipartite bargaining at company or group of companies level. A governing body is established at the first level with functions of governance of labour relations, the Higher Tripartite Council, which will act as a consultative body in the fixing of the national minimum wage and will organize the other levels (branch of activity or wages councils), etc.
.At the second level, bargaining is structured by branch of activity or productive chain. It follows the traditional tripartite model that exists in the country; i.e. the bargaining that takes place in wages councils. The Act includes an interesting variable, albeit not defined in detail, that it can also be organized by productive chains. Lastly, at the third level, classic collective bargaining takes place.
.Its predominant characteristic is that it is bipartite, which means that it takes place between an employer, group of employers, one or more employers' representative organizations on the one hand, and on the other, by one or more workers' organizations. In this respect, national doctrine has underlined that  trade unions have always distrusted the company agreement, either for fear that a generalization of the bargaining model could put the activity in crisis, or because they considered that at company level the trade union is weaker and thus the workers have less bargaining power. This distrust is not capricious but feeds on a reality which showed, especially in the period ' , that the company agreement very often meant a mere formula to reduce workers' benefits'  The provisions of article  of the new Act are important, to the extent that they establish that the parties may bargain by branch, sector of activity, company, establishment or at any other level that they consider appropriate, but on condition that the lower bargaining levels may not diminish the minimum provisions adopted at a higher bargaining level,  except as agreed in the respective wages council'  This means enshrining what are commonly called opt-out clauses.
.Chapter I, as the complainants recognize, refers to the fundamental principles and rights of the collective bargaining system. These articles do no more than assemble the principles of international labour law applicable to collective bargaining, set out in countless international agreements and especially the international labour Conventions which the employers believe to have been violated. With respect to the obligation to negotiate in good faith and the right to information (article ), it seems to be a case of the historic opposition of the Uruguayan entrepreneurial movement to any proposal to introduce collective bargaining. The right to information stems from the right to negotiate in good faith and is extensively developed in Article  of ILO Recommendation No. .
.The Government underlines that there can be no free, serious and productive collective bargaining without the inclusion of this type of obligation. In particular, because, without reliable data, no one can be certain what the bargaining is about. If the employers' sector in a bargaining round declares that it is in a critical state and the workers do not even have the possibility of checking that, the result could be improper bargaining. The right to information is essential for collective bargaining and bargaining in good faith includes providing information so that the other party is in a position of equality.
.In addition, as indicated in the justification prepared by the Executive Power with its submission to the national Parliament, article  partially reproduces ILO Recommendation No.  on collective bargaining, establishing mechanisms for exchange of information and consultations, and including the obligation of secrecy. It is not sought to subjugate a company s confidentiality and secrets, but simply to achieve a degree of transparency in matters which relate to its present and future conditions. The employers saw an absence of substance in the article if it did not impose some kind of responsibility for any breach of the duty of secrecy, but the final wording of the Act was improved to take account of those criticisms with the addition precisely of the obligation of secrecy ' .. breach of which shall give rise to the civil liability of those in breach' 
.With regard to the impossibility of enforcing the responsibility of trade unions due to the fact that there was no obligation on them to possess legal personality, the Government states that this is a half truth. It is true that the system of collective law, which is abstentionist by definition, based on the utmost freedom of association, does not require trade unions to have legal personality in order to be able to act in the world of work. In other words, acquiring legal personality is a requirement in their own interest. Constitutionally, article  of the Constitution promotes this type of organization by offering them exemptions from fees for acquiring legal personality. It is crucial to recall here that the State does not create the trade union. It forms itself. By granting it legal personality, the State does no more than recognize a pre-existing state of affairs and comply with an international, not to mention constitutional, obligation. In practice, the majority of trade unions at branch of activity level do have legal personality, thus if it is sought to take action against them for civil liability, there would be no obstacles from the point of national positive law. In any case, it is reiterated that the intended regulation has nothing to do with a law regulating collective bargaining. It would have to be the subject of a law on professional associations.
.Article  of the Bill and the Act provides for communication and consultation between the parties, taking as a basis the principles included in ILO Recommendation No.  on consultation. It is not understood how this point could inconvenience the employers. Moreover, as indicated, in a climate of broad social dialogue and tripartism as developed by the",0,2009,Uruguay
36,"current administration, there has been a surfeit of spaces for participation and consultation.
.As regards Chapter II, to which the complainants object, creating the Higher Tripartite Council, the Government indicates that this does not involve anything new. It simply enacts in law a body created by decree of the Executive Power which has functioned on a tripartite basis in wage bargaining rounds from  to the present and in which, in fact, the complainants participated as full members. As regards what happened before, Act No.  did not establish this body, but refers only to the establishment of wages councils, without specifying the existence of a coordinating or governing body. However, prior to the de facto end of the Government which ruled in the country from  to  February , there was the National Programming Commission (Comisin Nacional Programtica ' CONAPRO), whose purpose was to act as a mechanism to coordinate the principal lines of action to be announced at the start of each new presidential term. Within the Commission there was a specialized group on labour relations which, among its other activities, was engaged in studying the re-establishment of wages councils, policies for setting the minimum wage, etc. Once it had concluded its work, the need emerged to keep this group and the so-called Higher Wages Council was set up. This was a body composed of high-level representatives of the labour relations system which had certain powers of governance, coordination, etc. with regard to wage matters.
.After the end of the first post-dictatorship Government (), wages councils were never convened again until , thus no traces of that body remained. When the present administration took office, it was decided as a matter of policy to re-establish the wages councils, issuing for that purpose Decree No. / of  March , which convened the bodies in question. In its article , the Decree created a Higher Tripartite Council with the following tasks: (a) to analyse and decide the re-classification of activity groups of wages councils and disputes arising in that respect; (b) the second task set out in the Decree was to  analyse and draft amendments to be introduced into Act No.  of  November '  and (c) in practice, the Higher Tripartite Council took on other powers: as the forum in which the Executive Power presented its economic plans for each round, it dealt with trends in each, and it sought to be a forum for initial discussion on the creation of a bill on promotion and protection of the right to organize, etc.
.The Government states that it is impossible to analyse this body without first understanding the Bill as a whole. The Bill, which has now become the Act which establishes the national collective bargaining system, is structured basically at three bargaining levels: the first, macro, the Higher Tripartite Council, which will have the following powers: (a) to act as the consultative body prior to the fixing and/or modification of the national minimum wage and wages in those areas where they cannot be set by a collective bargaining process; (b) carry out classification of tripartite bargaining groups by branch of activity or productive chains, in each case designating the bargaining bodies in each sphere. That is what happened from  onwards; (c) advise the Executive Power on the allocation of administrative resources in the light of decisions concerning the classification of companies. This function had also been fulfilled in practice, for companies in particular, by the Tripartite Commission on Classification and Grouping of Labour Activities; (d) study questions related to bargaining levels. For example, if a company agreement can affect the minima laid down in an agreement reached at branch of activity level, etc.; and (e) study and adopt initiatives to promote consultation, collective bargaining and the development of labour relations.
.A second level, where collective bargaining takes place by branch of activity, the purpose of which is to fix minimum wages by branch or sector of activity, conforms to the traditional type of collective bargaining in the country. The third level of collective bargaining takes place at company level.
.As set out in the abovementioned exposition of justification for the Bill:  In this case, legal confirmation is given to a body which has been crucial to the holding of the most recent wages councils, when it achieved almost complete agreement for the formation of activity groups, an agreement subsequently confirmed by decree of the Executive Power' (another example of social dialogue and effective tripartism). According to the Government, the complainants are confusing collective bargaining with labour relations, asserting that the Council would have to take the governing role in collective bargaining in all its dimensions, forgetting that collective bargaining is by definition bipartite, free and voluntary. Anyone who is familiar with the constitutional obligations of the Uruguayan State and the international obligations it has assumed through the signature of numerous treaties in the UN, the OAS and the ILO, must realize that the State often has to intervene and direct aspects of the labour relations system. For years, the Uruguayan State was told that it was not fully in compliance with the international obligations assumed on freedom of association, by not adequately protecting trade union officials and militants through, for example, mechanisms for reinstatement or reincorporation. The obligations assumed in a multiplicity of international instruments require protection of this fundamental human right. In that case, then, (due to the particular national situation), that would require state intervention to promote it, and direction by the State to ensure compliance with these obligations of international origin, because one of the parties, the workers, found itself in a much weakened situation.
.In speaking of state interventionism in relation to collective bargaining, the Government is thinking of a limited concept, basically involving fixing of minimum wages. Curiously, the complainants omit any reference to ILO Conventions Nos  and , also ratified by Uruguay, under which the ILO has repeatedly made observations because consultation mechanisms were not being used to fix minimum wages, and the unionization of rural, public and domestic workers was not being promoted. The State, in the light of the obligations assumed in those Conventions, decided to intervene to promote the system of labour relations. Thus, collective bargaining, for example with regard to minimum wages, ceased to be exclusively free. On this point, the provision of paragraph  of Article  of Convention No.  should be observed. That is, in this area, fixing of minimum wages, an inescapable international obligation is assumed by the Uruguayan State towards the ILO to guarantee increases in citizens' minimum wages. This is achieved through the system of wages councils, thereby complying with its obligation to intervene in the system of fixing minimum wages and guaranteeing those wages and their increases.
.If a collective agreement reached freely fixes minimum wages below the national minimum, the State must intervene in that situation and correct it to comply with international law. The Government indicates that, for  years, i.e. from  to , tripartism in the country practically disappeared, trade unions grew weak, some disappeared, and the rate of membership fell below  per cent. Also, wages councils were not convened during that period, real wages fell in some cases by up to  per cent, social security was under-financed like never before, informal labour stood at levels close to  per cent, etc. The fact is that at the time the employers never demanded the tripartism they advocate today.
.The Government emphasizes that, at the branch of activity level alone, since the reestablishment of wages councils, over  collective agreements have been concluded, the rate of trade union membership has risen from  per cent to over  per cent, formalization of work has been given an impetus, unemployment has maintained a constant downward path, membership of and contributions to the social security system have vastly increased and, above all, companies have multiplied without losing competitiveness. It is not for nothing that the country did not fall into recession during the recent global financial crisis. In Uruguay, tripartism is manifest. An infinite number of possibilities of this kind have been created. The law seeks to guarantee them and especially modify the process of convening wages councils. Previously, convocation was a matter for the government of the day. Thus, from  to , they functioned. The new Government in  did not convene them and this sphere of tripartism and social dialogue vanished, despite the workers' constant complaints and demands for reestablishment. The employers said nothing. Neither did the governments which took office in  and  recreate that possibility or apply Act No. . Neither did the employers protest on those occasions. However, the reform that is now enshrined in law, makes convocation by any of the three sectors involved at primary and secondary level compulsory, thus removing the discretionary nature of convocation from here on. In this way, tripartism is endowed with the three essential characteristics of predictability, stability and continuity, and removed from the",0,2009,Uruguay
37,"uncertainty of government policy.
.The Government indicates that another of the allegations is the criticism of the Act based on the false dichotomy of dirigisme nterventionism versus free and voluntary negotiation. The Government indicates that this is a false comparison. The State must, on some occasions, intervene in the system of labour relations (bearing in mind that to fail to do so, as did previous governments, is also a form of intervention which can be called inaction) to ensure fulfilment of workers' fundamental human rights, for example, respect for freedom of association, the right of collective bargaining, moral conscience, private life, right to limits on working time, etc. Many of these rights are grounded in the Constitution of the Republic itself; others in international obligations assumed by the Uruguayan State, for example, with the ILO. Intervention may also fall into a third category; i.e. creating legislation and conditions to foster the promotion of freedom of association, collective bargaining, the right to organize, etc. First, by constitutional mandate and secondly, by taking a decision and adopting a policy which finds in this system healthy, constructive and strong labour relations. One such obligation is to fix minimum wages for workers, with periodic adjustments and as far as possible to allow workers, employers and the State itself to participate on an equal footing.
.At the second level of collective bargaining (article  and following), it is established that wages councils shall comply with these international obligations, as they are responsible for  fixing the minimum amount of wages and conditions of work of all workers in the private sector ...'  The third level establishes bipartite collective bargaining (article  and following), where bargaining is free, voluntary and has the characteristics of collective autonomy. The Government considers that it is therefore tendentious and reflects an erroneous interpretation, aimed at confusing the Committee, to assert that in all cases where a bilateral agreement is not reached (typical collective agreement), wage councils will resort to wage fixing. Bilateral collective bargaining, i.e. classic collective agreements will continue, as they do now, to be free and voluntary, but in the matter of fixing minimum wages, when there is no agreement, when the bargaining in a branch of activity fails or in the absence of a collective bargaining framework, the State will convene the wages councils, which are tripartite bodies, to fix minimum wages and thus comply with Article  of ILO Convention No. .
.The Government indicates that, the comments that the decisions of the Council will not be properly balanced because the Government has more representatives than the professional sectors, shows that they are not familiar with or reject the way in which the major ILO organs function, where delegations do not have the same number of delegates by sector. In general, the State has twice as many as the professional sectors.
.As regards the objections to Chapter III, that the convocation to wages councils is in violation of free and voluntary bargaining, the Government states that the Bill, on the one hand, provides for classic collective bargaining, and on the other hand, through the socalled atypical collective bargaining, fulfils the obligation to fix minimum wages, in accordance with Convention No. . The proposed wording clearly draws on the abovementioned international instrument, thereby overcoming the observation that has been made against the country by the ILO s own supervisory bodies (Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference) which had repeatedly pointed out that the provisions of the Convention concerned were not being applied, because the public authorities were not consulting the most representative workers' organizations in the case of establishing, applying and modifying minimum wages.
.Furthermore, the collective bargaining that takes place in the wages councils continues to be free and voluntary. Although the State convenes the parties to this sphere of bargaining, it does so in order to fix minimum wages and their modifications. The professional organizations are free not to participate, but if they do not do so, they are the ones who fail to take advantage of or recognize this space for negotiation and consultation. In that case, the State can fix minimum wages without listening to them because they did not attend, or listening to only one of the parties. Attending wages councils does not involve an obligation to agree, as was said in the rounds that took place from  to now, where the percentage of unanimity was over  per cent and those agreed by a majority,  per cent. In the remaining average of  per cent where there was no form of agreement, the State made orders setting the minimum wages, but after having been present throughout the bargaining round, mediating to try and reach agreement. In this way, it fulfilled its obligation to fix minimum wages and create mechanisms for collective bargaining and consultation. The curious thing about the whole of this complaint is that the employers are apparently opposed to the way the system of wages councils operated, yet at local level they demanded vehemently to be involved in them and, when the moment of the bargaining reached an overwhelming majority, they signed collective agreements in those bodies.
.As regards the objections to Chapter IV on bipartite collective bargaining, and specifically the objection to the provisions that one of the defects lies in company collective bargaining ' .. in the absence of a workers' organization, bargaining authority passes to the most representative higher level organization ...'  The Government explains that it arises because in Uruguay almost all companies are micro-, small or medium-sized enterprises. Trade unions are essentially organized not at company level but by branch of activity. In other words, the workers join this branch union, because there is no union in their company. Thus there are a great many federations, such as the Commercial and Industrial Workers' Federation of Uruguay (FUECI), the Federation of Beverage Sector Workers (FOEB) and the Uruguayan Health Federation (FUS). That is why, historically, collective bargaining in the country has basically been by branch of activity. It also means that the collective interests of workers in a company who belong to a branch trade union may be represented by that organization.
.As regards the other criticism that  administrative checks to test representativeness and consultation are missing'  the Government states that the criteria used are in line with those established by the ILO itself. However, the criticism may be addressed in the regulations which will undoubtedly ensue from the Act. As regards Chapter V on prevention and resolution of disputes, the Government reiterates that articles '  on occupations of workplaces were excluded from the Bill by decision of the President of the Republic, as duly communicated to the employers and announced to the public.
.Lastly, the Government states that the complaint is based on assumptions that can be clearly seen as untrue and fallacious. To deny that social dialogue and tripartism exist in Uruguay is to deny reality, or perhaps it is to seek to confuse those who need to understand the situation. For  years, wages councils were not convened, with the obvious consequences for workers' wages, which undoubtedly had an effect on social values. The impoverishment of the workers undermined the social fabric, concentrating wealth in a few sectors, increasing levels of informal work and weakening the unionized social actor.
.In its communication of  January , the Government indicates that although it had already sent its observations concerning the case, it considered it of crucial importance to explain the reasons why the Government was delayed in formulating its observations. The Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, relating to the th Session held in November , made an urgent call to the Government, as at the time it still had not received the requested information. In this regard and bearing in mind that the Government has always endeavoured to submit a prompt reply to cases raised, it wishes to express with respect to the present case that it relates to a Collective Bargaining Bill submitted to the national Parliament in October , which since then has been the subject of various amendments.
.Among these amendments, special mention should be made of the undertaking given by the President of the Republic to withdraw articles ' , which refer to occupations of workplaces, from the original Bill; a commitment made to the employers' sector and the public, in that it was communicated to the national press, and was in turn transmitted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to the parliamentary authorities, the employers and the various media. In addition, as regards the parliamentary processing of the Bill, it should be mentioned that it was analysed by the Committee on Labour Legislation in the Chamber of Representatives (item No.  of ) and by the Committee of Labour Affairs and Social Security in the Senate (item No.  of ), after hearing representations from the Merchant",0,2009,Uruguay
38,"Chamber of Country Products, the CNCS, the CIU, the National Association of Uruguayan Broadcasters (ANDEBU), the Uruguayan Hauliers' Federation (ITPC), the Association of Private Construction Promoters of Uruguay (APPCU), the Uruguayan Construction Chamber (CCU), the Internal Press Organization (OPI), the Este Construction Industry Chamber (CICE), the Uruguayan Construction League, the Chamber of Tourism, the Navigation Centre, the National Association of Micro- and Small Entrepreneurs (ANMYPE), the Uruguayan Fishing Vessel Owners Chamber (CAPU), the Uruguayan Fishing Industry Chamber (CIPU), the National Mercantile Chamber, as well as the Director of the Institute of Labour Law and Social Security in the Faculty of Law of the University of the Republic, the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers ' National Workers' Convention (PIT CNT), and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.As can be seen from the foregoing, the study, analysis and process of the Collective Bargaining Bill took several months, underwent several amendments, for which reason the Secretariat of State considered it appropriate to await the outcome in order to formulate its reply in this case. To this should be added the fact that in July , there was a change of authorities in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, both the Minister and ViceMinister. Finally, on  September , Act No.  was enacted on Fundamental Principles and Rights of the Collective Bargaining System, and when the Government was preparing to present its observations, it received a note from the ILO in which additional information relating to this complaint was provided, which had to be considered again. The Government reiterates that it has always formulated its observations to the various complaints that it has received as promptly as possible. However, this case has not been typical, in that a series of instances and events arose which prevented us from honouring our obligations with the desired promptness.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations allege that, at the instance of the Government, a series of labour laws were passed without consulting or without taking into account the contributions of the employers' sector and they also object to a Bill (which subsequently became law in Act No. ) creating a system of collective bargaining.Absence of consultation in good faith in the adoption of labour legislation
.With regard to the allegation that at the instance of the Government, a series of labour laws were passed without open consultations in good faith and without sufficient time for the employers' sector to express its views and discuss them in depth in order to reach an appropriate compromise (the complainant organizations refer extensively to Decree No.  of  which revoked two decrees, one which had been in force for over  years, which allowed the Ministry of the Interior to clear company premises which had been occupied by the workers; Act No.  which created the Register of Offending Companies within the ambit of the Inspectorate-General of Labour; Act No.  on Freedom of Association and its regulations in Decree No. /; Act No.  which increased the period of prescription of labour credits; Act No.  of August  on filing of accounts and budget performance reports; Act No.  of December  on intermediation and subcontracting of labour; Decree No. / regulating ILO Convention No. ; Act No.  of January  which establishes rules on labour responsibility in processes of corporate decentralization; and in particular, the Collective Bargaining Act, No. ), the Committee notes that the Government declares that: () it has pursued a policy of democratizing social dialogue in all possible areas, based on the purest of tripartism; () negotiating on a tripartite basis in good faith does not necessary mean reaching unanimity or consensus; () if one of the parties to the negotiation uses a systematic strategy of refusing any kind of reform, it means that the rest of the sectors involved can decide the matter by a majority, as the pursuit of social consensus cannot impede, let alone deny, the reforms needed by the country to continue its progress; () several political parties of all philosophical persuasions of the Uruguayan social spectrum are represented in the national Parliament where proposed laws are sent for discussion and approval and each professional group is heard there; () an example showing that the employers' sector is heard is the fact that articles '  of the Collective Bargaining Bill were withdrawn by order of the President of the Republic; () since the arrival of the new Government in March , authentic tripartism and social dialogue had been established and the employers' side had always been listened to. Proof of that was that in the case of wages, over  per cent of the activities reached collective agreements by unanimity; they are always heard and committees are created in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and they are received in parliamentary circles; () it is not true that the labour laws adopted were not the product of social dialogue; there were hearings in the process prior to the adoption of the laws on freedom of association, subcontracting or outsourcing, special licences, prescription of labour credits and the Bill to create a national system of collective bargaining; () with regard to the Collective Bargaining Bill (subsequently Act No. ), the employers were invited to participate and began the process and then voluntarily withdrew, and in the parliamentary process, the employers' organizations, workers' organizations and representatives of academia were received; and () opening a space for social dialogue, tripartism or collective bargaining does not necessarily require an agreement to be concluded.
.In this respect, the Committee notes the contradictory statements of the Government and the complainant organizations as to whether or not there was sufficient consultation in good faith with a view to reaching, as far as possible, shared solutions in the framework of the adoption of labour laws. The Committee recalls that the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), Paragraph , provides that measures appropriate to national conditions should be taken to promote effective consultation and cooperation at the industrial and national levels between public authorities and employers' and workers' organizations, and that under the provisions of Paragraph  of that Recommendation, such consultation and cooperation should aim, in particular, at ensuring that the competent public authorities seek the views, advice and assistance of employers' and workers' organizations in an appropriate manner, in respect of such matters as the preparation and implementation of laws and regulations affecting their interests. The Committee also recalls that on many occasions it has emphasized that  it is important that consultations take place in good faith, confidence and mutual respect, and that the parties have sufficient time to express their views and discuss them in full with a view to reaching a suitable compromise. The Government must also ensure that it attaches the necessary importance to agreements reached between workers' and employers' organizations'  [See Digest of the decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. .] The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for those principles so that legislation which directly affects the interests of workers' and employers' organizations shall be the subject of full and frank consultations and should be the result of shared solutions.
.As regards the abovementioned Decree No.  of , which, according to the complainants, revoked two decrees, one which had been in force for over  years, which allowed the Ministry of the Interior to clear company premises which had been occupied by the workers, the Committee is of the view that the exercise of the right to strike and the occupation of the premises should also respect the right to work of non-strikers and the right of the management to enter its premises. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for these principles in regulatory legislation and in practice.The Collective Bargaining Act, No. 
.With regard to the impugned Act No. , the Committee, firstly, takes due note that the Government informs that some articles of the Bill, which gave rise to the complaint and had been opposed by the complainant organizations relating to occupation of the workplace during a strike, were not included in the Act which was ultimately passed.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations allege that: () the Act in question provides for Government intervention in collective bargaining by virtue of the creation of the Higher Tripartite Council as the body for the coordination and governance of labour relations (article ), with a tripartite composition, but with a majority of representatives of the Government (nine Government representatives, six representatives of the most representative employers' organizations and six of the most representative workers' organizations); () article , paragraph (d), provides that the Council s powers will include considering and pronouncing on questions related to the tripartite and bipartite bargaining levels and paragraph (e) provides that it may study and adopt initiatives to promote consultation, collective bargaining and the development of labour relations; () the greater number of delegates of",0,2009,Uruguay
39,"the Executive Power, nominal voting and powers defined in a broad, ambiguous, confused and ill-defined manner, is undoubtedly a case of a body whose objective is intervention and meddling in labour affairs and collective bargaining; () article  of the Act, which provides for the compulsory extension of the term of a collective agreement until substituted by a new agreement, constitutes interference in free collective bargaining; () article  relating to the functioning of wages councils is not in conformity with the principles of collective bargaining when it establishes that decisions of these councils only take effect when registered and published by the Executive Power; and () this Act provides for intervention and interference by the authorities in violation of Conventions Nos  and , which gave rise to the observation of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its observation on the application by Uruguay of Convention No. .
.The Committee notes that the Government states that in general: () when the administration took office, the labour relations scene was dismal, minimum wages were appalling, collective bargaining hardly existed and freedom of association was suppressed; () the legislation contained flagrant contraventions of international Conventions and, for example, rural workers and domestic workers did not have a limited working day nor the right to bargaining in wages councils; () the wages councils were not convened after , and there were less than  company-only collective agreements which covered less than  per cent of the total workforce; () between ' , numerous collective agreements were signed on terms which diminished workers' rights, and when the new Government took office in , one of its first measures was to establish wages councils; () from  to , these bodies had not been convened, despite the fact that the Act which created them was fully in force and the employers' sector had never lodged a complaint; () the wages councils are tripartite bodies whose chief responsibility is to set minimum wages by branch of activity and category, but they also have other powers such as to act as conciliation bodies in the case of collective disputes, fix wage increases for the remaining workers, etc.; () as a first step, the Higher Tripartite Council was set up, and then  activity groups were organized which in turn established subgroups;( ) a framework for discussion was established in the public sector, which reached a framework agreement and by consensus a law on collective bargaining for the public sector and a wages council was set up for domestic or homeworkers, which culminated in a collective agreement; and () three bargaining rounds took place, over  per cent of all collective agreements were reached unanimously, and there was a significant rise in real wages.
.More specifically, with regard to the text of the Act, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the bargaining system is structured at three levels (national scope; branch of activity or productive chain; and bipartite collective bargaining at company or group of companies level); () at the first level, a governing body is established, with functions of governance of labour relations, called the Higher Tripartite Council, at the second level, bargaining is structured by branch of activity and the bargaining takes place in wages councils, and at the third level, classic collective bargaining takes place (the most prominent feature of which is that it is bipartite); () article  of the new Act is important in that it establishes that lower bargaining levels may not diminish the minimum provisions adopted at a higher bargaining level, except as agreed in the respective wages council; () the right to information set out in article  stems from the right to negotiate in good faith and is extensively developed in ILO Recommendation No. , and partially reproduces ILO Recommendation No. , establishing mechanisms for exchange of information and consultations, and including the obligation of secrecy (the majority of trade unions at branch of activity level do have legal personality, thus if it is sought to take action against them for civil liability, there would be no obstacles from the point of national positive law; () the creation of the Higher Tripartite Council did not signify any intervention, but enacts in law a body created by the Executive Power which has functioned on a tripartite basis in wage bargaining rounds since  (the Government refers to the historical evolution of wages councils in the country); () the complainants are confusing collective bargaining with labour relations when they assert that the Council would have to take a governing role in collective bargaining in all its dimensions, forgetting that collective bargaining is by definition bipartite, free and voluntary; () under article , at the second collective bargaining level, wages councils are responsible for fixing the minimum amount of wages and conditions of work for all workers in the private sector and at the third level, collective bargaining is bipartite and free and has all the characteristics of collective autonomy; () as regards the alleged imbalance of representatives on the Council, they show that they are not familiar with the way in which the major ILO organs function, where delegations do not have the same number of delegates by sector; () the convocation to wages councils fulfils the obligation to fix minimum wages, in accordance with Convention No. ; () the decision that in company collective bargaining, in the absence of a workers' organization, bargaining authority passes to the most representative higher level organization arises because in Uruguay almost all companies are micro-, small or medium-sized enterprises and trade unions are essentially organized not at company level but by branch of activity; () as regards the criticism that administrative checks to test representativeness and consultation are missing, the criteria used are in line with those established by the ILO, but may be the subject of regulations in the future.
.The Committee welcomes the Government s aim of promoting collective bargaining, increased coverage of collective agreements and the number of agreements. With regard to the content of the Act, the Committee formulates the following comments on the articles which may raise problems of conformity with the principles of collective bargaining or which warrant interpretation in accordance with those principles:I. with respect to the exchange of information necessary to allow the normal conduct of the process of collective bargaining and that in the case of confidential information, its communication carries the implicit obligation of secrecy, and breach thereof would give rise to civil liability of those who are in breach (article ), the Committee considers that all the parties to the negotiation, whether or not they have legal personality, must be liable for any breaches of the right to secrecy of the information which they receive in the framework of collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that this principle is respected;II. as regards the composition of the Higher Tripartite Council (article ), the Committee considers that an equal number of members could be taken into account for each of the three sectors, and also the appointment of an independent chairperson, preferably nominated by the workers' and employers' organizations jointly, who could break the deadlock in the event of a vote. The Committee requests the Government to hold discussions with the social partners on the modification of the law so as to arrive at a negotiated solution to the number of members of the Council;III. with respect to the powers of the Higher Tripartite Council and in particular considering and pronouncing on questions related to the tripartite and bipartite bargaining levels (article , paragraph (d)), the Committee has emphasized on many occasions that  the determination of the bargaining level is essentially a matter to be left to the discretion of the parties'  [See Digest of the decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. .] The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures including the amendment of existing legislation to ensure that the bargaining level is established by the parties and is not subject to voting in a tripartite body;IV. as regards the possibility of wages councils establishing conditions of work for each case to be agreed by the employers' and workers' delegates in the respective wage group (article ), the Committee recalls, firstly, that under ILO standards, the fixing of minimum wages may be subject to decisions by tripartite bodies. On the other hand, recalling that it is up to the legislative authority to determine the legal minimum standards for conditions of work and that Article  of Convention No.  seeks to promote bipartite bargaining to fix conditions of work, the Committee hopes that in application of those principles, any collective agreement on fixing of conditions of employment will be the result of an agreement between the parties, as the article in question appears to envisage;V. with respect to the subject of bipartite collective bargaining and, in particular, that in company collective bargaining where",0,2009,Uruguay
40,"there is no workers' organization, bargaining authority should pass to the representative higher level organization (article , last sentence), the Committee observes that the complainant organizations consider that the absence of a trade union does not mean the absence of collective relations in the company. The Committee considers, on the one hand, that bargaining with the most representative higher trade union level organization should only take place if it had a number of members in the company in accordance with the national legislation of each country. The Committee recalls, on the other hand, that the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ), gives pre-eminence to workers' organizations as one of the parties to collective bargaining, and refers to representatives of non-organized workers only in the case of absence of such organizations. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that future legislation takes these principles fully into account;VI. as regards the effects of the collective agreement and, in particular, that the collective agreement by sector of activity concluded by the most representative organizations is of mandatory application to all employers and workers at the respective bargaining level once it has been registered and published by the Executive Power (article ), the Committee, taking into account the concern expressed by the complainant organizations, requests the Government to ensure that the process of registration and publication of the collective agreement only involves checks on compliance with the legal minima and questions of form, such as, for example, the determination of the parties and the beneficiaries of the agreement with sufficient precision and the duration of the agreement;VII. as regards the duration of collective agreements and, in particular, the maintenance in force of all the clauses of the agreement which has expired until a new agreement replaces it, unless the parties have agreed otherwise (article , second paragraph), the Committee recalls that the duration of collective agreements is primarily a matter for the parties involved, but if government action is being considered any legislation should reflect tripartite agreement [see Digest, op.cit., para. ]. In these circumstances, taking into account that the complainant organizations have expressed disagreement with the whole idea of automatic continuing effect of collective agreements, the Committee invites the Government to discuss with the social partners on amendments to the legislation in order to find a solution acceptable to both parties.
.The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to take measures, including the amendment of the Collective Bargaining Act (No. ), to give effect to the conclusions formulated in the foregoing paragraphs in order to ensure full conformity of that Act with the Conventions ratified by Uruguay on collective bargaining. The Committee draws this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the abovementioned Decree No.  of , which revoked two decrees, one which had been in force for over  years, which allowed the Ministry of the Interior to clear company premises which had been occupied by the workers, the Committee is of the view that the exercise of the right to strike and the occupation of the premises should respect the right to work of non-strikers, and the right of the management to enter its premises. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for these principles in regulatory legislation and practice.(b) The Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations, to take measures to amend Act No. , in order to give effect to the conclusions formulated in the foregoing paragraphs and to ensure full conformity with the principles of collective bargaining and the Conventions ratified by Uruguay on the subject. The Committee requests to be kept informed in this regard.(c) The Committee draws this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",0,2009,Uruguay
41,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Civil Service Trade Unions (COFE) dated  January . COFE sent further information in a communication dated June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  January , COFE states that Uruguay is one of the few exceptions to the system of codification of labour law, both individually and collectively. Collective labour law in Uruguay constitutes a genuine edifice of both doctrine and case law. That edifice is based on a number of specific legislative components which provide foundations in terms of standards, programmes and principles. Thus, the most important legal standards are article  of the Constitution of the Republic, which provides that the law shall promote the organization of trade unions, granting them certain exemptions and establishing regulations for giving them legal personality, and ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and  on freedom of association and on the right to organize and collective bargaining, ratified by Act No.  of  November  and Act No.  of  May , respectively.
.With regard to freedom of association for public employees, reference should be made to the importance for Uruguayan law of the provisions of Convention No. , particularly Article  thereof, which states that they must enjoy protection against anti-union discrimination. At national level, the Parliament of the Republic recently approved Act No.  of  January  concerning protection of freedom of association, according to which actions or omissions that breach the terms of the abovementioned law are deemed null and void and specific procedures are laid down to safeguard the exercise of freedom of association. The complainant alleges that it is precisely these standards which have been violated by anti-union administrative acts issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the Ministry of National Defence.
.COFE indicates that, on  April , the Uruguayan Air Traffic Controllers' Association (ACTAU) issued a statement concerning the resolution passed by the general assembly the previous day, whereby it decided  to endorse the measures adopted by COFE to carry out a work stoppage on  May '  It also declared that  services will be provided for flights in the areas of health care, search and rescue operations and humanitarian assistance'  On  May ACTAU and COFE, the latter represented by its President Mr Pablo Cabrera and organizational secretary Mr Ricardo Barboza, participated in a meeting at the Labour and Social Security Ministry convened by the national labour director and attended by the Ministry s Under-Secretary for Defence and its human resources director. An offer was made to ACTAU at the meeting to open negotiations relating to their set of demands in exchange for calling off the stoppage planned for  May. On  May the Government s proposal was put to the ACTAU general assembly, which decided to go ahead with the stoppage as planned.
.On  May , the Labour and Social Security Ministry, with the signature of the labour and defence ministers, issued Resolution No. / declaring air traffic control to be an essential service. It also stated that it was for the National Defence Ministry to decide what services were to be provided during the strike period. The National Defence Ministry resolution declared the following to be essential services: air traffic control services, aeronautical operation and information services, aeronautical police services, and electrical/electronic system operation and maintenance services.
.COFE asserts that such resolutions constitute an unlawful restriction of one of the fundamental rights of freedom of association, namely the right to strike, on the following grounds. Firstly, COFE members ACTAU (the Uruguayan Air Traffic Controllers' Association) and AFAC (the Association of Civil Aviation Officials) made provision for the work stoppage called by the unions to include coverage of the services required for flights of a humanitarian nature (health care and technical emergencies). In other words, the confederation itself imposed limits on the exercise of its own right to strike, precisely by establishing minimum coverage of the essential needs of the service. COFE therefore considers it to be clear that the essential services imposed by law were absolutely unnecessary. Hence, and also because of the form in which the above resolutions were drafted, COFE considers that the Government s objective was to limit exercise of the right to strike to a specific category of public servants.
.ACTAU considers that analysis of the various elements involved can only lead to this conclusion. Indeed, a causal link can be seen between the Government s objective and the methods and grounds invoked in the unlawful limitation of this fundamental right. If the workers themselves had guaranteed to provide specific emergency services to cover humanitarian flights, the authorities can have had no other objective than to impose limits on the right to strike of a particular category of public employees. According to COFE, all services were declared to be essential without distinguishing between categories of duties or officials, and the declaration of their essential nature was not made in conjunction with any specific dispute.
.COFE points out that the resolution issued by the labour and defence ministers is based on Freedom of Association Committee principles which have been used to justify limitation of the strike by the Government but have been taken out of context without the analysis required under the fundamental principles on which all case law is based.
.COFE asserts that the declaration of the essential nature of a service depends on the criteria used to define it, i.e. whether or not there is a danger to life, safety or health. Defining a service as essential cannot be done without an in-depth analysis of these determining factors. The cases referred to by the Government highlight precisely the need for a case-by-case analysis, since use of the term  may' indicates the existence of possibilities. In other words, it is on the basis of a case-by-case analysis using the criteria deriving from the principles of the Freedom of Association Committee that the services in question may or may not be declared essential. Analysis always leads to a specific, factual situation, and herein lies the violation of freedom of association by the Government. COFE asserts that the specific situation showed that the declaration of the services concerned as essential was not necessary and hence the Government s declaration was aimed simply at limiting a fundamental right of all public or private sector workers.
.In its communication of June , COFE alleges that the defence minister, by means of a new resolution dated  December , declared air traffic control, aeronautical operations and information, aeronautical police operations and electric/electronic systems operation and maintenance, to be essential services. COFE asserts that this resolution, which is identical in tone to the one which gave rise to the complaint, is proof of the fact that the Government is obstructing the exercise of the right to strike in air traffic control.
.In its communication of  August , the Government declares that, as regards the trade union s self-regulation with respect to the right to strike, the argument used is unacceptable. The Government states that, with respect to essential services, there is a delicate balance between the rights of the workers concerned and the rights of the community as a whole. Under Uruguayan law, the Constitution of the Republic (article ) imposes the principle of the continuity of public services and in a democratic State only the public authority can decide what constitutes essential services (in the present case, these were technically determined by the competent ministry, namely the National Defence Ministry). The case of the air traffic controllers is perhaps the most visible example of essential services, since human life is at stake in a stark and immediate form. In case of doubt, the right to life has to take priority.
.The Government states that the complaint also argues that paragraph  of the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee indicates that various services, including  transport generally'   do not constitute essential services in the strict sense of the term'  Even accepting the dubious inclusion of air traffic controllers under the heading of  transport generally'  the definition would be generic and hence the specific provision concerning air traffic controllers would prevail. The Government finds it strange that the complaint does not refer to  compensatory guarantees' or to the specific means of dispute resolution which have been established by the Freedom of Association Committee.
.The Government points out in this case that it is well known that both the Labour Ministry and the National Defence Ministry have maintained, and still maintain, mechanisms for dialogue and bargaining at the highest political level. Under the labour relations system in Uruguay, it is difficult to resolve a dispute by arbitration where the latter has",0,2008,Uruguay
42,"not been promoted by the trade union. Furthermore, dialogue is in progress regarding the possibility of concluding a bilateral agreement on minimum services, which, in the Government s view, complies with the criteria of the Freedom of Association Committee. As regards COFE s claim that the Government s objective was simply to limit a fundamental right of all workers in the public and private sectors, the Government points out that it is necessary to define the legal and institutional parameters which determine its action in this matter. Three constitutional provisions lay down guidelines which must be considered together when resolving specific cases.
.Article  of the Constitution of the Republic states:  Striking is a union right. The exercise and effectiveness thereof shall be regulated on this basis'  It should be understood here that the legislative provision, in recognizing a general legal principle, establishes a right which is not absolute. The legal system of a State specifies the legal entitlements which it wishes to safeguard. Government administration must be aligned to this and therefore it is not a question of protecting a solitary legal entitlement but of effectively safeguarding them all. The first paragraph of article  of the Constitution states that the law shall establish public service regulations on the basis that the public servant exists for the service and not vice versa. Article  of the Constitution states that the law may prescribe, inter alia, the means and procedures which the public authority may use for maintaining the continuity of services.
.Specific facts must be analysed according to the contexts and processes of which they form a part. It should be emphasized that the Government has been scrupulous in its compliance with Article  of Convention No.  regarding freedom of association for public employees. The Government has also been one of the parties backing the adoption of Act No.  of  January  on the protection of freedom of association, referred to by the complainants in the present case. In Uruguay the regulations applicable to disputes in essential services have a legislative basis, Resolution No. / of  May  declaring air traffic control to be an essential service having been adopted in accordance with section  of Act No.  of  December  and section () of Legislative Decree No.  of  June .
.The decision made by the National Defence Ministry, in exercise of its powers, regarding the services to be provided was based on the definition of the duty of ensuring operational safety laid down in the bipartite agreement of  November  negotiated between the National Defence Ministry (MDN), on the one hand, and the Confederation of Civil Service Trade Unions (COFE), the Uruguayan Air Traffic Controllers' Association (ACTAU) and the Association of Civil Aviation Officials (AFAC), on the other. As regards the measures on strike limitation in the essential services, it should be noted that a meeting was convened by the national labour director on  May  which was attended by the National Defence Ministry authorities and representatives of ACTAU and COFE and at which the former proposed the launch of negotiations to deal with the officials' claims, in return for an undertaking to call off the stoppage announced for  May . This proposal was rejected by the ACTAU general assembly. However, negotiations took place subsequently which resulted in agreements such as the MDN/COFE ACTAU AFAC bipartite bargaining agreement of  November .
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organization objects to Ministry of Labour and Social Security Resolution No. / of  May  declaring air traffic control to be an essential service and that the Ministry of Defence had to decide which services were to be provided during the strike period (the complainant alleges that the Defence Ministry again declared air traffic control an essential service in December ). The Committee also observes that the complainant states that the Government s objective was to limit the right to strike of a specific category of public servants and that declaring air traffic control services essential was not necessary in view of the fact that COFE, AFAC stated that the stoppage would include coverage of services of a humanitarian nature (health care and technical emergencies).
.The Committee notes the Government s statement to the effect that: () as far as essential services are concerned, there is a delicate balance between the rights of the workers and the rights of the community; () article  of the Constitution of Uruguay imposes the principle of the continuity of public services and only the public authority can decide what those services are; () the case of the air traffic controllers is possibly the most visible example of essential services since human life may be at stake; () the Constitution of Uruguay establishes the right to strike but this is not absolute; () the determination by the National Defence Ministry of the services to be provided was based on the definition of the duty of ensuring operational safety; () on  May  a meeting convened by the national labour director took place between the authorities, the National Defence Ministry and representatives of ACTAU and COFE, at which it was proposed to launch negotiations to deal with the officials' claims, in return for an undertaking to call off the stoppage announced for  May , but this proposal was rejected by ACTAU, and () since then negotiations took place, however, which resulted in agreements such as the bipartite bargaining agreement of  November  between the National Defence Ministry, COFE, ACTAU and AFAC.
.The Committee recalls that  the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited: () in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State; or () in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population)'  and includes  air traffic control' in the list of services that  may be considered to be essential' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee also recalls that, as regards the nature of appropriate guarantees in cases where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services and the public service, restrictions on the right to strike should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and in which the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.Accordingly, the Committee considers that the challenged resolution (Ministry of Labour and Social Security Resolution No. / of  May ) declaring air traffic control to be an essential service does not violate the principles of freedom of association as regards the right to strike. Furthermore, the Committee notes with interest that workers in the sector enjoy the right to collective bargaining and that they have reached an agreement with the Defence Ministry. Under these circumstances, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to consider that this case does not call for further examination.",0,2008,Uruguay
43,".Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government, in future situations in which the suspension of a non-essential service might justify requiring a minimum operational service, to enable the participation of the relevant employers' and workers' organizations in the process and not to resort to the unilateral imposition of a minimum service. In the event of disagreement as to the minimum service to be maintained during the suspension of activities, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that any such disagreement is settled by an independent body.",0,2006,Uruguay
44,".The Committee last examined this case, involving allegations of anti-union persecution against members of the Montevideo Teachers' Association (ADES), at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee expected that the investigations under way would determine why the management of Liceo No.  in Montevideo had imposed sanctions and taken various measures against the members of ADES mentioned by name in the complaint, and requested the Government, if they were found to have occurred for anti-union reasons, to take measures to lift them immediately. Furthermore, the Committee hoped that the proceedings would be concluded very soon, and asked the Government to keep it informed of the final result of the investigations under way and of any related appeals lodged.
.In a communication dated  August , the Government states the following regarding the actions carried out before the Secondary Education Council (CES) as a result of the complaints lodged against the teachers Dinorah Siniscalchi, Pedro Balbi, Adriana Romano, Winston Mombr and Fernando Moreno, which led to them being  prejudiced in their employment as a consequence of the normal exercise of trade union activities'  the legal basis of which is provided by Article () and () of ILO Convention No. :' Administrative investigation carried out at Liceo No. , in the light of the events involving Dinorah Siniscalchi: (a) the procedure followed was in accordance with Ordinance No. ; (b) cause: the head teacher of Liceo No.  issued a verbal warning to the teacher in question after she made statements of a political nature in her classroom, commenting that the father of a female student (complainant) was a National Party candidate; (c) the CES annulled the warning issued by the head teacher and started an administrative investigation to determine responsibility; (d) as a result of that investigation, it was found that the teacher was responsible for a violation of the Teaching Staff Rules as regards the requirement to remain fit to perform her duties and carry out her duties in a dignified, effective and responsible manner, as well as complying and ensuring compliance with the legal provisions and rules of the teaching body and respecting the hierarchical order (section (a) and (g)); the CES disciplined the teacher by issuing a written warning, to be noted on her record (section (b) of the Teaching Staff Rules); and (e) it was not the head teacher who disciplined the teacher but rather the CES itself, following an administrative investigation.' Pre-trial proceedings against Pedro Balbi: (a) these disciplinary proceedings were instituted in the light of certain incidents involving Mr Balbi, including physical and verbal aggression directed at the head teacher on the steps of Liceo No.  in front of teachers and students, this being proved during the first stage of the procedure; (b) Mr Balbi s behaviour was a clear violation of the duties of a teacher (section (a) and (g) of the Teaching Staff Rules) and he was consequently suspended by the CES for  days; and (c) the proceedings were conducted in accordance with the established rules and the teacher enjoyed all the guarantees of due process. He thus had recourse to the respective administrative channel through which he could have challenged the outcome of the proceedings.' Teaching performance scores awarded to teachers Adriana Romano, Dinorah Siniscalchi, Pedro Balbi, Winston Mambr and Fernando Moreno: (a) the complainant believes that the scores awarded to the teachers by the management for the  and  periods constituted a violation of freedom of association; the teachers were being victimized because their annual assessment scores had been reduced, and this clearly constituted persecution; (a) () when assessing teachers, the management use the same assessment form for all staff members. This form refers only to educational and pedagogical matters. Assessments carried out by the management cover issues regarding teaching performance and duties, and never refer to trade union membership or activity; (a) () the scores awarded did not in any way prejudice the teachers concerned. First, the assessment is preliminary in nature and may be challenged by the party concerned. Secondly, if the teacher objects to the assessment, the head teacher considers the objection and, if necessary, refers it to the relevant assessment board so that it can be evaluated and confirmed or adjusted. If the original score is upheld and confirmed by the CES, the party concerned has recourse to the relevant administrative channel and, if necessary, may take his case to the Administrative Tribunal. In the case of the teachers in question, none of them were prejudiced in terms of their position on the grade scale.
.According to the Government, the sanctions imposed against Pedro Balbi and Dinorah Siniscalchi were the result of a disciplinary procedure provided for under the regulations governing the administration and adopted by the CES, in accordance with the powers granted by the constitution and by law. The scores awarded to the teachers by the head teacher were determined by their teaching performance, not their union membership, and their placement on the professional grade scale was in no way affected by their annual assessment scores. The secondary education authorities exercised due oversight over the management s disciplinary procedures, in accordance with the Teaching Staff Rules (the relevant and definitive ordinances within the constitutional order), and the teachers enjoyed all the guarantees afforded by the rule of law regarding their right to a defence should they have grievances concerning any decisions by the CES. Consequently, the trade union s claim that there is an institutional strategy aimed at limiting the exercise of freedom of association cannot be considered valid. On the contrary, the existence of trade union posters, the recognition of trade unions by the authorities, the  clear lines of trade union communication' between the central trade union body and branches in schools, the holding of teaching staff assemblies, and so on, are all proof of the constitutional guarantees in place. Furthermore, these elements also serve to show that the very highest authorities are doing all that they can to ensure that freedom of association is respected. Moreover, the complainants have recourse to legal remedies in defence of their rights.
.The Government states that: (a) under the terms of the ruling issued by the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security, the trade union s claim that there is an institutional strategy in place aimed at limiting the exercise of freedom of association cannot be considered valid for the reasons given in the ruling; (b) however, the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security has informed the National Public Education Administration Secondary Education Council (ANEP CES) that, when the compulsory preliminary assessment system was implemented by management, no thought was given to the special situation that prevailed at Liceo No.  and, as a result, the fundamental rights of the teaching staff as a whole were undermined, especially those of employees who resorted to force, directly affecting the working environment; and (c) owing to this method of assessment, a high-ranking management team, which had to address critical situations that brought into question its approach, carried out assessments of the work of the teachers involved (in accordance with the Teaching Staff Rules) when it was clear that that team lacked the  technical objectivity' required for the task.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee expects that the investigations under way will determine why the authorities of Liceo No.  in Montevideo imposed sanctions and took various measures against the members of the Montevideo Teachers' Association, mentioned by name in the complaint, and requests the Government, if this is found to have occurred for anti-union reasons, to take measures to lift them immediately. Furthermore, the Committee hopes that the proceedings will be concluded very soon and asks the Government to keep it informed of the final result of the investigations under way and of any related appeals lodged.",1,2006,Uruguay
45,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Federation of Secondary School Teachers (FENAPES) and the Association of Secondary Education Teachers (ADES) dated June . In a communication dated July , these organizations sent additional information.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of June , the National Federation of Secondary School Teachers (FENAPES) and the Association of Secondary Education Teachers (ADES) allege that the freedom of association and trade union rights of one of its officials, Mrs. Silvia Lujambio, deputy head of an educational establishment (Liceo No. ) had been infringed.
.The complainant organizations state that in Uruguay, the career path of teachers in secondary education is based on advancement, by what the statutory rules call  ualified seniority'  i.e., the allocation of a general points score based on length of service, computed activity (number of classes actually taught) and teaching skills, i.e., the teachers' training, judgements and assessments. The latter concept, teaching aptitude, has the highest weighting in calculating the points score for  ualified seniority' ( out of ). In turn, one of the most important factors in teaching aptitude are assessments contained in an annual report by heads of educational establishments (liceos) and by subject inspectors.
.They indicate that this has meant that, at times, these annual reports are used by the hierarchy as means of controlling the teacher s adaptability to the imposed models. In other words, the annual report on the teacher is used not to evaluate his technical and pedagogical performance but to reward or censure the teachers' ideological conformity with the model, plan or simply the profile required by the school programme drawn up by the management. In other words, a dangerous manipulation can be observed of a highly sensitive aspect of professional life in the context of a relationship not of respect and tolerance, but of authority. This has left members of the complainant organizations highly vulnerable in respect of the educational reforms which were rejected or denounced by their trade unions. Even more serious, however, according to the complainants, is that the method complained of here has begun to be used directly to suppress the exercise of trade union rights.
.The FENAPES and ADES allege that this has occurred with the trade union official, Mrs. Silvia Lujambio, at the time of her annual report as deputy head by the head of the educational establishment where she is employed (Liceo No. ). The complainants state that she was the victim of a clear anti-trade union posture which infringes her legal rights and entitlements, forcing the trade union to intervene and present this complaint. All this is aggravated by the fact that it is not just hindrance or obstruction of the exercise of such rights, including the imposition of sanctions for exercising them, but simply that for participating in trade union activity, especially as an official, a person s technical and pedagogical performance is assessed unfavourably.
.The complainants indicate that the abovementioned report on the official in question, includes remarks such as the existence of  circumstantial observations'   for attending an ADES meeting in the staff room and not communicating' and in the  general opinion' on the teacher, it is stated:  teacher who should perform her work impartially, and keep her work separate from her trade union activity'  It is clear that, because she was an official, Mrs. Lujambio s performance was assessed unfavourably compared with the average of her assessments for recent years and in comparison with her peers.
.The complainants state that this matter has caused alarm in teacher trade union circles, alarm which reflects the nature of the rights infringed. This is because it shows a disregard for the fundamental rights which by their nature go beyond this member s particular situation. The fact is that an observation amounting to disciplinary censure was made in an assessment of technical performance because of Mrs. Lujambio s participation as an official in a trade union meeting.
.The complainants state that the situation of which they complain shows a clear disregard for the exercise of trade union rights and thereby violates article  of the Constitution of the Republic and ILO Conventions Nos.  and . Finally, they state that a complaint was also made to the Secondary Education Council, a public body responsible for the administration of the education system at secondary level.
.In its communication of July , the complainant organizations report that the trade union official in question, under the provisions of article  of the Teaching Staff Rules, exercised the right of rebuttal concerning the assessment made, on the grounds that it infringed her legitimate right to freedom of association and trade union rights as well as her professional career. According to the complainants, the management report and the trade union official s rebuttal should have resulted in the convening of an assessment panel to settle the dispute. Until now, this panel has not taken action. It further adds that despite the seriousness of the complaint, neither has the Secondary Education Council of the National Public Education Administration made any pronouncement.
.In its letter of  December , the Government states that civil servants in general and those of the central administration in particular, are subject to regulations which govern their rights, duties and obligations. Their rights include security of tenure, advancement, remuneration and administrative disciplinary proceedings with guarantees of due process, without prejudice to the right to subsequent review by the courts. These regulations are a solid guarantee for civil servants, both with regard to protection of their career path in the administration and citizens' rights and rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining. Convention No. , ratified by Uruguay, is applied in full to government workers with the exception of military personnel, police, diplomatic staff and persons of a political character (ministers, directors of executing agencies, directors of autonomous entities, etc.) who are subject to different regulations by virtue of the nature of their functions. Under the terms of the Constitution, public employees enjoy adequate trade union protection.
.The Government adds that there is no general law that provides free time for the exercise of trade union duties, but in all public organizations trade union officials are granted trade union leave to carry out the tasks inherent in their office, and various collective agreements expressly provide for trade union leave.
.With respect to the annual assessment report of Mrs. Silvia Lujambio by the head of the establishment in which she works (Liceo No. ), the Government states that, on  August  the legal office of the Primary Education Council reported as follows: () the legal office is not dealing with the points score awarded to Mrs. Lujambio because it is not relevant to this case; () in relation to the substance of the matter, it considers that: (a) the assessment report in question contains matters which  while not constituting clear persecution' depart from the comments that a report should contain; (b) it considers that the head of the establishment should not have included in the report matters which go beyond functional (pedagogical or technical) aspects and even less should they be taken into account as positive or negative factors in her assessment; (c) the assessment must be totally objective and impartial; (d) consequently, the legal office considers that the head of the establishment should be cautioned that she should not consider matters other than functional aspects when assessing her staff; and (e) opinions such as those expressed in the report on Mrs. Lujambio may infringe the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic.
.The Government adds that the Montevideo Head Teacher Assessment Board, at its meeting of  September , concluded that the assessment made in the report in question should be rejected, and Mrs. Lujambio s last performance report on her work in  at the Liceo San Jacinto taken into account as her latest performance report.
.Finally, the Government states that the Secondary Education Council, considering the report of the legal office of  August  and the Montevideo Head Teacher Assessment Board at its meeting on  September , decided:  to reject the assessment made in the management report for  by the Head of Liceo No.  on Mrs. Silvia Lujambio Grene'   It ordered that Mrs. Lujambio s last performance report in  as deputy head at the Liceo San Jacinto should be taken into account as the latest teacher performance report'  The Government emphasizes that in the light of the foregoing reports, in its opinion there has been no violation of Conventions Nos. ,  and .
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations allege that the authorities of the educational establishment, Liceo No. , had used the annual assessment report of Mrs Silva Lujambio, a trade union official of FENAPES and",0,2004,Uruguay
46,"ADES, to curb the exercise of her trade union rights. Specifically, the complainant organizations allege that she was assessed unfavourably as a result of exercising her trade union activities and that a disciplinary censure was made in an assessment of technical performance because she had participated in a trade union meeting.
.The Committee notes that the Government states that: () The legal office stated that: (a) the assessment report in question contains matters which  while not constituting clear persecution' depart from the comments that such a report should contain; (b) it considers that the head of the establishment should not have included in the report matters which went beyond the functional (pedagogical or technical) aspects and even less should they be taken into account as positive or negative factors in her assessment; (c) the assessment must be totally objective and impartial; (d) consequently, the legal office considers that the head of the establishment should be cautioned that she should not consider matters external to the functional aspects when assessing her staff; and (e) opinions such as those expressed in the report on Mrs. Lujambio may infringe the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic; () the Montevideo Head Teacher Assessment Board, at its meeting of  September , concluded that the assessment made in the report in question should be rejected, taking into account Mrs. Lujambio s last performance report in  at the Liceo San Jacinto as her latest performance report; and () the Secondary Education Council, considering the report of the legal office, and the Montevideo Head Teacher Assessment Board decided to reject the assessment made in the management report for  by the Head of Liceo No.  on Mrs. Silvia Lujambio Grene and ordered that Mrs. Lujambio s last teacher performance assessment in  should be taken into account.
.Observing that the annual assessment report of the trade union official, Mrs. Lujambio, which had been contested by the complainant organizations on the grounds that its contents constituted an act of anti-trade union persecution, had been rejected, the Committee considers that the present case does not require further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not require further examination.",1,2004,Uruguay
47,".The complaints are contained in communications from the Inter-Trade Union Assembly-Workers' National Convention (PIT-CNT) and the Autonomous Union of Gas Workers and Employees (UAOEGAS) dated  May and  July , respectively. The UAOEGAS sent new allegations in a communication of  September . The Government sent its observations in a communication of  December .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  May,  July and  September , the Inter-Trade Union Assembly-Workers' National Convention (PIT-CNT) and the Autonomous Union of Gas Workers and Employees (UAOEGAS) allege that the Gaseba S.A. enterprise, a subsidiary company of Gaz de France, established a yellow union in  through its human resources manager and used a fax machine belonging to the human resources office to make the initial announcement to workers. Furthermore, they allege that the enterprise constantly takes measures to prevent trade union communication amongst workers (trade union representations to the enterprise s management, informative talks, etc.) and puts pressure on workers to withdraw their support from the UAOEGAS and resign from this organization.
.Furthermore, the enterprise rejected a petition presented by the UAOEGAS through the letter of  June  to enter into dialogue with the executive committee of the UAOEGAS on specific priority issues, on the grounds that the letter in question was signed by Mr. Washington Beltrn (president of the trade union), who had been dismissed.
.Moreover, the complainants allege that the enterprise has not fulfilled some of the provisions of the agreement of  March , concluded following the dismissal of  workers (including some PIT-CNT officers), which, according to the enterprise (although never proven) was due to financial problems and restructuring. The non-fulfilment of these provisions (lack of training for workers who had been provisionally registered for unemployment benefit; the failure to create the tripartite assessment commission and the possibility of special leave for up to  months) led, in practice, to the unilateral dismissal of Mr. Washington Beltrn, Mr. Angel Garca Almada and Mr. Luis A. Puig.
.In its communication of  December , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has repeatedly inspected the Gaseba Uruguay S.A. enterprise for occupational health and safety reasons as well as to assess the non-fulfilment of labour obligations that are subject to monitoring by the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate and obviously include the respect of freedom of association. As regards the alleged establishment of a yellow union, it should be noted that although a new trade union called the Association of Gas Employees (AFGAS) was established at the enterprise in , this organization was set up through the free exercise of freedom of association as prescribed by Convention No.  itself. According to the Government, it should be noted that although this accusation is one of major significance, it was made three years after the alleged false creation of the trade union.
.The Government points out that since its establishment in , the Association of Gas Employees (AFGAS) has proceeded to elect its executive members through secret voting by its members, has participated in elections for members of the Executive Committee for Standard Medical Insurance at Gaseba S.A. enterprise and enjoys the same privileges that the enterprise has traditionally granted the UAOEGAS. Therefore, the UAOEGAS and the AFGAS have use of the trade union noticeboard and, at the same time, the enterprise uses a check-off facility for the members of both organizations.
.The Government states that, of a total of  employees,  are members of the UAOEGAS, which represents . per cent of the workers,  are members of the AFGAS, representing . per cent of the workers, and the remaining  per cent do not belong to a trade union. These figures are a clear sign of the exercise of freedom of association, and of how the enterprise effectively respects the wishes of its workers, not only as regards the possibility of joining the trade union of their choice, but also regarding the participatory bodies involved in labour relations. There is nothing to suggest that the AFGAS is a trade union falsely created at the request of the enterprise or a yellow union. Quite the contrary, it is the result of the free exercise of freedom of association. Furthermore, the UAOEGAS is certainly respected as the majority trade union to the extent that its representatives, along with delegates designated by the enterprise, became members of the bipartite body which manages standard medical insurance through general and secret elections recently held at the institution.
.The Government states that no further comments are required on the allegations made by the UAOEGAS regarding the dispute which occurred on  December  and was concluded with the agreement of  March  and the request to reinstate Mr. Washington Beltrn, Mr. Angel Garca Almada and Mr. Luis Puig. The Government recalls that as stated by the complainant itself, the PIT-CNT, the Ministry of Labour, various parliamentary commissions, the provincial government of Montevideo, the Municipal City Council of Montevideo and the Political Committee of the Broad Front were involved in the agreement that put an end to the dispute in question. Furthermore, this very case was assessed through administrative procedures as well as in the international sphere by the Committee on Freedom of Association itself.
.The Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security launched an official administrative investigation by the General Inspectorate to establish whether Gaseba S.A. enterprise had committed any acts of an anti-union nature in  when it dismissed  workers, including some trade union officers. On that occasion, and following extensive procedures which included processing the ample evidence provided by both parties involved (the trade union and the enterprise), the administration considered that trade union repression had not occurred and decided that the file on this case should be closed. The Government adds that the Committee on Freedom of Association came to a similar decision in Case No.  when issuing its interim conclusions in Report No. .
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainants allege that the Gaseba S.A. enterprise: () established a yellow union in ; () takes measures to prevent trade union communication amongst workers and puts pressure on them to resign from the UAOEGAS trade union; () rejected a petition presented by the UAOEGAS in June  to enter into dialogue on priority issues, on the grounds that the communication was signed by a dismissed worker (the president of the UAOEGAS, Mr. Washington Beltrn); and () has not fulfilled some of the articles of the agreement concluded on  March  following the dismissal of  workers, which has led, in practice, to the dismissal of Mr. Washington Beltrn, Mr. Angel Garca Almada and Mr. Luis A. Puig.
.As regards the alleged establishment of a yellow union by the enterprise (the complainant alleges that through the human resources manager a fax machine belonging to the enterprise was used to make the initial announcement to workers) as well as the alleged measures taken by the enterprise to prevent trade union communication amongst workers, pressure on workers to resign from the UAOEGAS and the rejection of a petition presented by the UAOEGAS in June  to enter into dialogue on priority issues, on the grounds that the communication was signed by a dismissed worker, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has repeatedly inspected the enterprise for occupational health and safety reasons as well as to assess the fulfilment of labour obligations; () in , as a result of the free exercise of freedom of association, a new trade union called the Association of Gas Employees (AFGAS) was established at the enterprise; () the UAOEGAS and the AFGAS have use of the trade union noticeboard and, at the same time, the enterprise uses a check-off facility for the members of both organizations; () of a total of  employees,  are members of the UAOEGAS and  are members of the AFGAS; and () the UAOEGAS is respected as the majority trade union and as such its representatives, along with delegates designated by the enterprise, became members of the bipartite body which manages standard medical insurance through general and secret elections recently held at the institution. In this respect, the Committee does not have sufficient information to make any conclusions on the involvement of the enterprise in the establishment of the AFGAS. The Committee also observes that the Government has not sent precise observations on the alleged measures taken by the enterprise against the UAOEGAS (it indicates generally that inspections have been conducted) and that the allegations made by the complainants are general (for example, it does not provide the names of the workers who were put under pressure to resign from",0,2003,Uruguay
48,"the UAOEGAS nor the dates when such pressure was applied). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the complainants and the Government to send precise information concerning these allegations, so that, if necessary, the Government may launch without delay an independent investigation in this respect. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the alleged non-fulfilment by the Gaseba S.A. enterprise of some of the provisions of the agreement concluded on  March  following the dismissal of  workers, which has led, in practice, to the dismissal of Mr. Washington Beltrn, Mr. Angel Garca Almada and Mr. Luis A. Puig, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () this case has already been assessed through administrative procedures and by the Committee (Case No. ); and () at that time the General Labour Inspectorate conducted an investigation and, following extensive procedures which included processing the ample evidence provided, considered that trade union repression had not occurred. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the issue of the dismissals of the trade union officers in question was already assessed during the examination of a complaint presented by the PIT-CNT in , and that on that occasion it was concluded that ""there is not sufficient evidence to state with certainty that the dismissal of the trade union officials is linked to their trade union functions or activities, given that they took place under the terms of the agreement of  March "" [see th Report, Case No. , para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:As regards the alleged establishment of a yellow union by the Gaseba S.A. enterprise, as well as the alleged measures taken by the enterprise to prevent trade union communication amongst workers, pressure to resign from the UAOEGAS and the rejection of a petition presented by the UAOEGAS in June  to enter into dialogue on priority issues, on the grounds that the communication was signed by a dismissed worker, the Committee requests both the Government and the complainants to send precise information concerning these allegations, so that, if necessary, the Government may launch an independent investigation without delay in this respect.",1,2003,Uruguay
49,".At its meeting in June , the Committee noted the sharp fall, from  per cent to  per cent, in the proportion of workers in all sectors covered by collective agreements, a fact that was not denied by the Government. Furthermore, the Committee requested the Government to examine, with the complainant and all other concerned parties, the state of collective bargaining in the graphic arts sector, and to communicate the measures taken to promote collective bargaining in that sector [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )]. At its meeting in March , the Committee reiterated its earlier recommendations [see th Report, paras. -].
.In a communication dated  April , the Government indicated that since the date of the last report, various changes have been made in labour relations and that in May , the Government convened the Wages Councils, tripartite cooperative bodies whose principal tasks are to set wages and categories. In that regard, an atmosphere of collective bargaining was fostered in the various sectors. Graphics workers remained included in group No.  (National Executive Decree No. /) and in that group of activity the following three subgroups were created: (a) general printing works; (b) journalistic enterprises (the press); and (c) advertising on public highways. Collective agreements were reached in the three groups of activity lasting one year and expiring on  April . In addition, there are already plans to convene another session of the Wages Councils in early May.
.The Committee notes this information with interest.
.At its meeting in June , the Committee noted the sharp fall, from  per cent to  per cent, in the proportion of workers in all sectors covered by collective agreements, a fact that was not denied by the Government. The Committee requested the Government to take measures to promote collective bargaining in conformity with Article  of Convention No. ; to examine, with the complainant and all other concerned parties, the state of collective bargaining in the graphic arts sector; and to communicate any measure taken to promote collective bargaining in that sector [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that there is currently a situation of expectation regarding the manner in which collective bargaining will be carried on in the country, given that the right of collective bargaining is not restricted in Uruguay and the convening of sectoral wage councils is one of the commitments of the new Government elect.
.The Committee takes note of this information, and requests the Government to communicate any measure adopted with a view to promoting collective bargaining.
.The present complaint is contained in a communication from the Graphic Arts Union (SAG) together with the Inter-Trade Union Assembly-Workers' National Convention (PIT-CNT) dated  May . The SAG sent supplementary information in a communication dated  July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  May and  July , the Graphic Arts Union (SAG) and the Inter-Trade Union Assembly-Workers' National Convention (PIT-CNT) indicate that since , successive governments including the present one, instead of promoting the full development and implementation of voluntary collective bargaining procedures with a view to establishing collective agreements on conditions of employment in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , have created obstacles, in most cases insurmountable ones, to the effective exercise of the right to collective bargaining. As a result, the proportion of the workforce covered by collective agreements has declined since  from  per cent to  per cent. The SAG claims that in the case of graphic arts, the last collective agreements concluded for the daily newspaper and public works and roads sectors date respectively from  and  and have lapsed.
.The complainants further state that obstacles to collective bargaining take the form of failure on the part of the Government to convene the Wages Councils since . These are tripartite bodies made up of representatives of the Ministry of Labour, employers' organizations and trade unions in all sectors except construction, health and transport, where conditions are determined by the State. The Councils are the only bodies that allow negotiation of wages, categories and conditions of employment, that are binding for the entire sector. In , the Ministry, at the express request of the SAG, invited the Association of Graphics Manufacturers of Uruguay (AIGU) and SAG to take part in negotiations, but when both those parties asked the Government to approve the agreement so as to ensure that it covered the entire sector, it refused to do so and the talks broke down.
.In its communication of  December , the Government outlined the historical background of the origins and development of collective bargaining in Uruguay and reviewed the current situation. The Government emphasizes that Uruguay has an excellent record of respecting and protecting freedom of association, collective bargaining and the right to strike. In , Act No.  was enacted, instituting the Wages Councils which, despite the fact that their role has been called into question, fulfilled an important role in improving workers' conditions and encouraging them to become unionized. Labour relations functioned normally until the advent of the military dictatorship in . Civil liberties were to be restored with the full restoration of democracy in .
.That new phase was marked by meetings of the Wages Councils, making it possible to legitimize trade union activity and re-establish a culture of collective bargaining, while enabling the National Executive to establish a degree of control of wages by preventing wage increases from being passed on to the prices of products and services. The Government adds that once the objectives of restoring trade union activity were attained, and in accordance with the wishes of the social actors involved, the State began gradually to withdraw from collective bargaining.
.The Government states that three types of collective bargaining are known in Uruguay, namely: (a) so-called ""typical"" collective bargaining, in the form of bilateral, unregulated and autonomous processes involving one or more enterprises and a trade union; (b) the system established within the Wages Councils set up in  under Act No. , the results of which were endorsed through awards which, once approved by the Executive, took effect even with regard to undertakings not represented in the talks; (c) ""mixed"" negotiations, marking a departure from the original terms of Act No.  resulting from the tendency of social partners to engage in bargaining in areas outside the remit of the tripartite bodies, while still submitting the results to the respective Wages Council with a view to extending them to other undertakings in the same branch or sector that were not affiliated to the organizations directly party to the agreement. The Government states that at present the first of these systems is in force without restriction, and the National Executive does not promote the other two types of bargaining.
.As regards the allegations concerning the sharp fall in the proportion of the workforce covered by collective agreements, the Government states that this phenomenon is evident in all countries and is due mainly to the decline in union membership. At the same time, there is a trend towards international collective bargaining.
.The Government also indicates that, in the present case, the trade union organization and the employers' body conduct their activities and labour relations in the private sphere without interference or obstruction of any kind.
.Lastly, the Government states that although there is currently no law on collective bargaining, attempts have been made, thus far without success, to establish a regulatory framework for collective bargaining.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the Graphic Arts Union (SAG) and the Inter-Trade Union Assembly-Workers' National Convention (PIT-CNT) allege that the Government has failed to encourage and develop collective bargaining, which has resulted in a decline in the proportion of the workforce covered by collective agreements from  per cent to  per cent. The complainants state that this is mainly due to the fact that the Government has not convened the Wages Councils since . The latter, in accordance with a tradition established by the social partners, endorse collective agreements concluded by trade unions and employers outside the tripartite system set up by the Councils, in order to extend their provisions to the entire sector in question. As a result, there have been no collective agreements in the graphics sector since , since, although there was a willingness to negotiate agreements on the part of the SAG and the Association of Graphics Manufacturers of Uruguay (AIGU), the Government puts an end to talks by its refusal to endorse them.
.The Committee notes the Government s reply, in which it gives a historical outline of collective bargaining in the country and states that there are three types of bargaining:",0,2003,Uruguay
50,"talks of the traditional type between a trade union and an employer or group of employers; bargaining of the type provided for in Act No. , the results of which are approved by awards which, once certified by the National Executive, are applicable even to undertakings not represented in the talks; and lastly, a mixed system that responds to initiatives by the trade unions and the employers which submit agreements concluded among themselves in private for approval by the Executive so that their provisions can be extended to the entire sector in question.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the parties enjoy total freedom to negotiate conditions of employment. The Committee notes that the dispute in the present case has arisen from the impossibility of extending collective agreements to the entire sector owing to the Government s failure to confirm the extension of the collective agreement. The complainants state, by way of example, that in  the Ministry of Labour, at the request of the SAG, invited the Association of Graphics Manufacturers of Uruguay (AIGU) and SAG to negotiate a collective agreement, but a request to the Government to confirm that the agreement would be applicable to the entire sector was rejected and talks broke down. The complainants maintain that the Government is thereby failing to observe Article  of Convention No. , which states the obligation ""to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation"". The Committee notes that the specific question of the extension of collective agreements is addressed not in Conventions Nos.  and , but in the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ), which does not provide for a strict obligation to extend the provisions of collective agreements. Nevertheless, the Committee underlines that Paragraph . of the Recommendation provides, ""Where appropriate, having regard to established collective bargaining practice, measures, to be determined by national laws or regulations and suited to the conditions of each country, should be taken to extend the application of all or certain stipulations of a collective agreement to all the employers and workers included within the industrial and territorial scope of the agreement"".
.The Committee, however, notes the sharp fall in the proportion of workers in all sectors covered by collective agreements, from  per cent to  per cent, a fact which is not denied by the Government. The Committee notes, with regard to the application of Convention No. , that the Committee of Experts has referred to observations by the PIT?CNT to the effect that collective bargaining is ""impossible in major sectors"", and requested the Government to provide ""information on the number of collective agreements concluded by enterprise and by sector, including the public sector, with an indication of the sectors and numbers of workers covered"" [see the Committee of Expert s observation on the application of Convention No.  in ]. In this context, the Committee requests the Government to examine, together with the complainant and all other concerned parties, the state of collective bargaining in the graphic arts sector, and to communicate any measures that may be adopted to promote collective bargaining in the sector in question.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to promote collective bargaining in conformity with Article  of Convention No. .(b) The Committee requests the Government to examine, with the complainant and all other concerned parties, the state of collective bargaining in the graphic arts sector.(c) The Committee requests the Government to communicate any measure that may be taken to promote collective bargaining in the sector.",0,2003,Uruguay
51,".At its meeting in March , when it examined allegations that, following the participation by dockworkers in May Day celebrations, the PLANIR SA company in reprisal had ceased to hire a number of workers, and that a blacklist had been drawn up preventing the workers in question from obtaining work, the Committee regretted the delay in the investigation of this case and requested the Government to inform it whether the enterprise had had recourse to the Administrative Tribunal against the fine imposed by the administrative authority and, if so, to inform it of the outcome. The Committee indicated that, if no appeal had been made, it expected that the fine would have been paid by the employer so as to serve as a dissuasive measure against any future acts of anti-union discrimination [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that, as PLANIR SA did not seek to have the penalty (the fine imposed by the administrative authority) quashed, the Ministry filed an application on  April  to the th departmental circuit magistrates' court of the capital to order payment. On  July , PLANIR SA reported to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to pay the fine.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Regretting the delay in the investigation of the allegations presented in this case, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether the PLANIR S.A. enterprise has had recourse to the Administrative Tribunal against the fine imposed by the administrative authority and, if so, to inform it of the outcome. If no appeal has been made, the Committee expects that the fine will have been paid by the employer so as to serve as a dissuassive measure for any future acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The complaint is set out in a letter from the Inter-Trade Union Assembly-Workers' National Convention (PIT-CNT) and the National Ports Administration United Trade Union (SUANP) of  May . The SUANP sent additional information in a letter of  June . The Government sent partial observations in a letter of  December . At its meeting in May-June , the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government to send complete observations [see th Report, para. ].
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their letter of  May , the Inter-Trade Union Assembly-Workers' National Convention (PIT-CNT) and the National Ports Administration United Trade Union (SUANP) report that, on  April , the manager of the PLANIR. S.A. asked the workers whether they would be at work on  May . The workers said that they would not be at work as they would be attending the labour day celebrations. The complainants add that, according to the operating companies roster, PLANIR S.A. was not scheduled to operate on that day.
.The complainant organizations state that PLANIR S.A. belongs to a group of three port operators, together with ESTIBAMAR S.A. and PORTACOR S.A., which provide services for MONTECON S.A. They say that during the day of  May  loading and unloading continued normally, with the other two operators, PORTACOR and ESTIBAMAR, working. In those companies, too, there were dockworkers not at work because they were attending the celebrations but they were not penalized by their companies. The complainants allege that, on  May , on arriving for the call up for work, the PLANIR S.A. workers found that they were not allowed to enter the company s premises, as the guards had an express order, with a list of their names, to refuse access. From that moment, a blacklist of dockworkers was drawn up and they were not allowed to return to work, without any explanation by PLANIR S.A.
.The complainants point out that this situation was reported by the SUANP to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security which, through its Division of Collective Bargaining, called a tripartite meeting which met four times. The first meeting took place on  May , when a lawyer representing PLANIR S.A. appeared. The company s representative said he was unaware of the system of calling to work and the situation of the workers concerned. For this reason, the SUANP considered that the lawyer was not a valid interlocutor for negotiating with the company. A further meeting was therefore requested, in which someone with some knowledge of the subject would attend for PLANIR S.A. The second meeting was held the following day, when the same lawyer arrived accompanied by another person, likewise a lawyer who, in the opinion of the complainants, also had no knowledge of dock work. These representatives claimed that PLANIR S.A. was not calling for day workers because MONTECON S.A. was not requesting PLANIR S.A. s services and also expressed readiness to call on the workers if they provided services to that company.
.The complainants explain, and indicate that they also explained this during the meeting convened by the Ministry, that MONTECON S.A. is a group of companies consisting of CHRISTOPHERSEN S.A. and CARGAS Y SERVICIOS S.A. which participate represented by PLANIR S.A. and ESTIBAMAR S.A. respectively. The complainants indicate that all these companies have the same capital, directors and business interest, and freely organize the call for workers to work. That means that they direct work to one or other operating company as they see fit. There is a third operator introduced by MONTECON S.A., PORTACOR S.A., which expressly does not observe  May or recognize trade union actions of any kind, precisely to prevent membership by workers interfering with the continuity of dock work.
.The complainants state that, in the light of the above, the SUANP requested that PLANIR S.A. and MONTECON S.A. should be invited together to a further meeting to resolve responsibility for calling to work, reminding the Ministry and the company that, on  May , the union s general meeting had decided unanimously to support the group of workers who had been harmed. The third meeting was attended by representatives of PLANIR S.A. and MONTECON S.A. as had been requested. MONTECON S.A. said that it awarded services to  the company it considered most reliable'  citing that PLANIR S.A. workers might take trade union action which would harm operations. Despite that, after an exchange of views, MONTECON S.A. undertook to maintain the order of call up for the three operating companies, which is what did indeed happened.
.The complainants report that, with respect to the form of call up used by PLANIR S.A., there was a change in its behaviour, which the SUANP considers to be a sanction against the workers. Although PLANIR S.A. called the suspended workers, it did so without considering the order previously used and observed by both parties until then, citing the casual nature of the dockworkers' employment and the company s power to call up whoever they wished from the greater number of workers available. For this reason, each of them worked fewer days, thus turning it into an economic sanction. This situation has not changed since. A fourth and final meeting was held, without bringing the positions closer together. Against this background, the SUANP stated in the final report which was signed in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security that PLANIR S.A. had for several years been keeping a register of workers in all categories, a matter determined by company practice. Those workers, now sanctioned, had priority for dock work in the call up because of their length of service and qualifications. The workers always expressed their availability for work in the form requested by PLANIR S.A. The complainants allege that this form of hiring was suddenly changed after  May , when the workers, when asked by their employers whether they would be attending the labour day celebrations, replied in the affirmative.
.The complainants state that PLANIR S.A. has shown that it does not recognize the SUANP and is not prepared to engage in dialogue since its representatives denied the truth of the events which occurred citing operational and not trade union problems. No final solutions resulted from the contacts with the company and hiring continued with trade union members relegated to second place in the list, even though they were the most senior.
.The complainant organizations allege that a new case of anti-trade union discrimination towards the same group of workers occurred on  May  when the Inter-Trade Union Assembly-Workers' National Convention (PIT-CNT) decided a general strike of three hours, which was observed by dockworkers belonging to the SUANP. Once again, following the strike, the dockworkers were not called up for work by the company, a situation that it was not possible to reverse in the negotiations",-1,2003,Uruguay
52,"conducted between the SUANP and the Ministry of Labour. Following that event, PLANIR S.A. informed the Ministry of Labour and the union at the bargaining table that it was ceasing its activity as container loading and unloading operator, which was where the dispute arose, and would continue its other operations on frozen goods and general cargo.
.Lastly, the complainant organizations allege that there is a blacklist which has been in effect since the date of the events described ( May ) and, until now, which prevents the workers on the list from obtaining new work, not only in PLANIR S.A. but also in the other port operating companies. The list includes the following stevedores: Washington Antelo, Fernando Martnez, Luis Pensado, Javier Martnez, Carlos Martnez, Daniel Duarte, Toms Callero, Pablo Gordillo, Olinmpto Trivel, Alex Lemos, Ramn Corbaln, Miguel Da Luz, Julio Cabrera, Washington Guillenea, Daniel Prez, Oscar Cardozo, Angel Gonzlez, Eduardo Hernndez, Pablo Occelli, Carlos Cabrera, Wilson Lpez, Marcelo Melgar, Fabin Martnez, Yimy Hernndez, Alfredo De Los Santos, Carlos Calvete; tally clerks: Ricardo Corn, Eduardo Costa, Miguel Panizza, Oscar Quiroga, Carlos Traverso, Carlos Prez, Jacinto Prez, Juan Carlos Gonzlez, Osvaldo Prez; foremen: Julio Rico and Artigas Fernndez.
.In its communication of  December , the Government reports that it has passed the complaint to the Chamber of Industry (the national business organization) asking it to send its observations and that it sent a note to the General Inspectorate of Labour to undertake an independent investigation. The Government indicates that it will send its observations once its has obtained the information in question.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations allege that, after participating in the  May celebrations , several workers in the dock sector ceased to be hired by the PLANIR S.A. company and other companies belonging to a group, and that a blacklist was drawn up preventing the dockworkers on the list from obtaining work.
.The Committee regrets that, after the complaints had been made in May  and despite addressing an urgent appeal to the Government [see th Report, para. ], the Government has confined itself to reporting that it requested the General Inspectorate of Labour to conduct an investigation into the allegations (which has not yet been concluded) and the Chamber of Industry to send its observations.
.The Committee recalls that the right to organize public meetings and processions, particularly on the occasion of May Day, constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ], and considers that participation by workers in a meeting or activities of this type should not have the consequence of disadvantaging them in subsequent hiring by a company.
.In addition, the Committee highlights the gravity of the allegation concerning the drawing up of a blacklist (the complainant organization provides the names of the persons included on it) which, according to the complainants, prevents the workers mentioned in it from obtaining work in the port companies. In this respect, the Committee recalls that  Workers face many practical difficulties in proving the real nature of their dismissal or denial of employment, especially when seen in the context of blacklisting, which is a practice whose very strength lies in its secrecy. While it is true that it is important for employers to obtain information about prospective employees, it is equally true that employees with past trade union membership or activities should be informed about the information held on them and given a chance to challenge it, especially if it is erroneous and obtained from an unreliable source. Moreover, in these conditions, the employees concerned would be more inclined to institute legal proceedings since they would be in a better position to prove the real nature of their dismissal or denial of employment and that the practice of blacklisting workers seriously undermines the exercise of trade union rights' [see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ].
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the investigation requested from the Inspectorate of Labour into the grave allegations submitted by the SUANP and the PIT-CNT is rapidly concluded and expresses the hope that the investigation will cover all the matters mentioned by the complainants. The Committee requests the Government to send the results of the investigation in question so that it can pronounce itself on the basis of all the elements.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the investigation requested from the Inspectorate of Labour into the grave allegations submitted by the SUANP and the PIT-CNT is rapidly completed and expresses the hope that the investigation will cover all the matters mentioned by the complainants.

.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the InterUnion Workers' Assembly-National Confederation of Workers (PIT-CNT) and the Confederation of Civil Service Trade Unions (COFE) dated June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of June , the InterUnion Workers' Assembly-National Confederation of Workers (PIT-CNT) and the Confederation of Civil Service Trade Unions (COFE) allege that, with occasional exceptions, in the central administration, i.e. civil servants working for the departments of state, no form of collective bargaining exists to regulate working conditions. Furthermore, the authorities have in fact been negligent in addressing the unions' demands, in the sense that the reforms of the organizational structures were not negotiated as they had implications for the profession and jobs, and that they ostensibly caused very serious changes to working conditions.
.As regards legislation, the only attempt at regulation has been section  of Act No.  of  January , which established a Permanent Committee on Labour Relations, within the purview of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, for the central administration and the bodies included in article  of the Constitution of the Republic (judicial authority, court of auditors, administrative court, electoral court, autonomous bodies and decentralized services, these last with the exception of industrial and commercial organizations). This Permanent Committee was given the strict task of advising on matters concerning salaries, working conditions and other issues regulated by international labour Conventions.
.However, neither the composition of the committee (since it is not bipartite) nor its mandate - to play an advisory role - corresponded to the standards laid down in ILO Convention No. . The committee has not been established, nor has any kind of functioning been recorded. It has convened only on two occasions. Thus, the claims and expectations of the civil servants' trade unions were not considered. These facts influenced the observations of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its reports for  (th Session),  (th Session),  (st Session) and  (nd Session).
.The complainants state that, at present, there is a clear and growing tendency in the central administration to increase the precariousness of labour relations, as a result of labour stability being undermined, access to the civil service taking place through fixed-term contracts, trade union rights - and the freedoms and guarantees which support them - being violated, etc. This situation is the consequence of the unilateral imposition of working conditions in all areas imaginable and the absence of collective bargaining. The complainants cite several specific cases in this regard: () state reform programmes, under budgetary Act No.  and its regulatory decrees, continuing the process of reforming budgetary and subsequent accounting standards which culminated in accounting Act No.  of  September  and its regulatory decree. According to the complainants, these standards have been used to introduce a regime of compulsory exclusion of civil servants from the administration and permanent civil servants are being replaced by civil servants with precarious contracts. In some cases, the authorities have declared their intention to force civil servants who are already in precarious situations to establish sole proprietorships; and () with regard to salaries, a further example of the various unilateral decisions which cannot be denied are Decrees No. / of  January  ""Advances on future salary increases for civil servants covered by the national budget and article  of the Constitution of the Republic"" and No. / of  May  ""Pay adjustments for civil servants"". According to the complainants, the first of these decrees implemented a salary increase through a loan contract taking the form of handing in ""food vouchers"" which, given its legal nature, is subject to the effect of future salary increases, and the second decree introduced a pay rise which contravened the regulations setting out the indices which must be taken into account for salary increases, as well as Convention No.  on collective bargaining.
.The complainants add that, on the few occasions when collective bargaining has taken place, the administration has later failed to comply with what was agreed. This is the case with the agreements made between the Federation of Public Health Civil Servants and the Ministry of Health on  November and  December , pertaining to the regulation of integral assistance benefit and later regulated by Decree No. / of  September  as regards extending these benefits to disabled persons.
.The complainants further state that, with regard to the enjoyment of trade union freedoms and immunity, situations have been recorded in which these were not recognized, in clear violation of the provisions of Convention No. . The most serious cases of this involve sums being discounted from the salaries of officials who participated in trade union activities. One of these was against an official of the Association of Civil Servants of the Ministry of Industry, Ms. Leonor Quefan, and ended in an action being brought before the administrative court, which found in favour of the worker; a second, involving an official of the Association of Civil Servants of the Radio Broadcasting Service, Ms. Anah Oldn, is currently being contested. In addition, they allege that workers affiliated to the Association of Workers of the National Transport Directorate of the Ministry of Transport and Public Works resolved at an assembly to undertake industrial action; the decision was communicated to the authorities, who immediately afterwards began disciplinary proceedings against the said officials.
.Lastly, the complainants state that the State s failure to recognize the right to collective bargaining creates a situation which is not only adverse in terms of current working conditions in the civil service, but has also caused alarming new outbreaks of repression with regard to the exercising of fundamental civil rights. In this context, they allege that, up to the date when the complaint was presented, it had been determined that around  civil servants from the electoral court had been subject to sanctions for the mere fact of having exercised their right to petition in relation to certain working conditions. The sanctions were the only response to their petition, with no right to previous defence. However, more serious still, when these sanctions were contested by means of the mechanisms laid down in the Constitution of the Republic, greater sanctions were applied.
.In its communication dated  December , the Government first states that, in order to arrive at an approximation of the problem raised, it is necessary to define specifically the term ""central administration"". This refers to the executive authority with its various departments or secretariats of state. The existence of autonomous bodies and decentralized services linked to the executive authority via the various ministries should also be pointed out.
.The Government states that civil servants in general, and those within the central administration in particular, are governed by a statute (an organic body of constitutional, legal and regulatory standards) which regulates their rights, duties and obligations. Certain of these rights stand out, namely, those relating to job stability, promotion, remuneration and the administrative disciplinary procedure with guarantees of due process, without prejudicing the right to a subsequent review through legal channels. This statute which, let us reiterate, has had constitutional value since , forms a solid guarantee for civil servants, as regards protecting administrative careers, as well as citizens' rights and rights deriving from freedom of association and collective bargaining. One of the most characteristic features of the statute for civil servants in Uruguay, which also distinguishes them from private activity, governed by a relatively stable system, is the so-called security of tenure, which means that the State cannot terminate a civil servant s contract except in cases of incompetence, negligence or criminal offences, following disciplinary action, with full guarantees of due process, and authorization from the Senate of the Republic. It is up to the President of the Republic, acting with the appropriate minister or ministers, or the relevant council of ministers, to dismiss public servants for incompetence, negligence or criminal offences, in all cases with the agreement of the chamber of senators.
.The Government points out that Uruguay has not been through a period of extensive privatization, and that instead, as a key part of its development strategy, it has begun a process of state reform aimed at",0,2003,Uruguay
54,"reducing the State s influence on the economy and providing better public services, thus to some extent overcoming the problem of State versus privatization. One of the instruments used in the process of state reform has been Act No.  of  January , which created the Executive Committee for State Reform (CEPRE), consisting of the Director of the Office of Planning and Budget, who chairs it, the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Director of the Office for the Civil Service. This committee is in charge of supervising the implementation of state reforms within the central administration, and also controlling the administrative restructuring proposed by the various ministries. At the same time, the above Act allowed the executive authority to enter into contracts with third parties to supply non-essential and support services, giving preference to companies formed by ex-civil servants or civil servants who are available because they have been granted extended leave of absence.
.With regard to the restructuring of the central administration, the executive authority approved Decree No. / dated  May . State reform should focus on the major tasks within its mandate, reassigning to them the resources given to low productivity activities or the resources from activities which should not be directly funded by the State, such as workshops, printing, cleaning, maintenance, security, transport of persons and goods, buildings, medical certificates and canteens, among others, which can all be contracted to third parties. Decree No. / of  September  regulates the systems for reinserting civil servants in jobs or companies, and the system of extended leave of absence for jobs and tasks contracted by the public administration. The doctrine has characterized this process as structural adjustment measures to restrict the activities carried out directly by the State, to rationalize existing services, to reduce the number of civil servants, and to introduce changes to the management and system of remuneration, with an active policy of transferring civil servants to the private sector, by means of reinsertion in jobs and companies. At the same time, efforts are made at trying to establish areas in which civil servants can participate, through their most representative organizations, in the Permanent Committee on Labour Relations. Therefore, the ""compulsory exclusion"" alleged by the complainants does not reflect reality, since there are various alternatives for civil servants, with appropriate guarantees, time periods and procedures.
.The Government adds that, more recently, it sanctioned Act No.  of  September  (accounting and budget execution balance for the  accounting period), which continues the restructuring process for staff who fulfil roles in the public administration, reiterating the restrictions for designating staff for public service, creating incentives for civil servants to retire, modifying the payment system and creating a statute for staff with fixed-term contracts. In reality, this Act has not introduced the concept of fixed-term contracts, since they already existed. The Act represents another contribution, both for workers and for the State, to the rights and obligations of this type of contracting and, far from making the situation more precarious, in fact provides legal assurance and establishes in written form a series of rights such as social benefits, annual leave, sickness cover, unemployment insurance and severance pay.
.The Government reports that Uruguay s enacted law has not limited freedom of association and has respected the autonomy and autarky of trade union organizations. The lack of heteronomous regulation of trade union organizations is perhaps one of the most characteristic aspects of Uruguayan labour law, and already incorporates a national legal conscience. By virtue of the national legal background and with the maximum guarantees, Uruguay s civil servants have formed and developed various trade union structures (COFE, ADEOM, AEBU), which in turn form part of the trade union umbrella organization PIT-CNT. From , these organizations began to make collective agreements at the level of industrial and commercial entities, as well as within government departments. Even though the organization in charge of social security - the Social Security Bank, incorporating social representatives - was at that time already developing collective bargaining quite smoothly, section  of Act No.  of  January , and interpretative Act No.  of  August , expressly authorized it to make collective agreements with staff, with the agreement of the Office of Planning and Budget, as well as to give advances, if it could not obtain the Office s approval.
.Act No.  of  January  established the Permanent Committee on Labour Relations for the central administration and the bodies included in article  of the Constitution of the Republic, i.e. the judicial authority, the administrative court, autonomous bodies, and non-industrial and commercial decentralized services, with the task of advising on matters concerning salaries, terms and conditions of employment and other issues regulated by international labour Conventions. In this respect, it should be pointed out that the committee maintained intensive activity in the period following its creation, but recently no meetings have been held between the parties. However, it should be stressed that, any of the parties involved can, by express legal provision, call a meeting on the basis of its interests. In fact, none of the organizations have done this, which can be explained by the fact that, independently of any meetings called in this framework, labour relations in the public sector are developing in complete normality, among state civil servants who show the highest rates of union membership.
.The Government points out that, between  and , there was free and smooth collective bargaining both in public companies and government departments and that, whilst it may be true that no collective agreements were made in the central administration, it is no less true that, in various bodies within the central government, there were instances of bargaining which enabled trade unions to carry out the demands of the administration in their respective budgetary provisions. This was the case with the Uruguayan Teachers' Federation (FUM), which pursued an intensive strategy of mobilization and participation, and was able to influence the transformation of the sector. Similarly, one could also cite the case of the Federation of Public Health Civil Servants (FFSP), which, during the aforementioned period, participated in the decision-making process concerning salary issues in its sector and influenced as a result both the five-year budget and the accounting Act.
.The Government explains that, in public companies, between  and  there were two spheres of bargaining: one centralized, in the Office of Planning and Budget, dealing with general matters, and the other decentralized in each of the companies. Centralized bargaining was never interrupted and in this sphere successive agreements were signed in the National Ports Administration (ANP), the telecommunications sector (ANTEL), state factories (UTE), the National Postal Administration (ANC), and the Social Security Bank (BPS), among others. As in public companies, in the public banking sector a centralized agreement was drawn up and signed in  to cover the four official banks, intended as a framework for improving and homogenizing labour relations within the sector, bringing them into line with the national and regional socio-economic climate.
.In  and , the public sector maintained the same characteristics as in the preceding period. No agreements were registered in the central administration and ongoing bargaining took place in public companies and the public banking sector. At this level, it is interesting to point out the agreement signed by the National Administration of Fuels, Alcohol and Portland (ANCAP) in March , which is a framework agreement that can be used in future as a basis for agreements in individual sections, modified to suit their own aims and objectives.
.According to the Government, the above clearly demonstrates that collective bargaining exists in the public sector and, in a regional and international context which is extremely complex and restrictive from the point of view of economic resources, has allowed society to coordinate the legitimate interests of civil servants with those of society in general, since it is society that supplies the resources to finance the budget, as well as being the end-user of the services provided by the State.
.In short, the Government repeats that there has been no change to the facilities offered by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to parties wishing to bargain collectively, and that such bargaining is carried out without any kind of restriction. No laws have been repealed, nor have any international labour Conventions been denounced which would allow one to conclude that the country s legislation has disintegrated towards deregulation of working conditions or precarious employment.
.The Government underlines, in relation to COFE s observations on the state reform provisions contained in Acts Nos.  and , that the application of these provisions has not led to compulsory exclusion of civil servants, nor is there any tendency for relations to become more precarious but, on the contrary, there has been a gain in security of law, with express recognition of labour and social security rights.
.With regard to salaries, the Government states, in relation to Decree No. / of  January , that it authorized the dependants",-1,2003,Uruguay
55,"of the bodies included in the national budget and article  of the Constitution of the Republic to obtain loans in respect of future salary increases, to be financed by the division of social credit of the Bank of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay which, by Decree No. / of  December , stated that the advances in respect of future salary increases provided for in the Government s Decree ""will be offset against general profits in the case of the bodies included in the national budget and debited from each of the relevant budgets"".
.As regards the alleged non-fulfilment of collective agreements on the part of the central administration, the Government states that civil servants, whether individually or collectively, have at their disposal the legal protection mechanisms provided under the rule of law. This can be illustrated by the case of civil servants in the Ministry of Public Health and the agreement recently concluded with the organization representing medical and non-medical staff.
.In relation to the cases of Ms. Leonor Quefan, a civil servant in the Ministry of Industry and Energy, and Ms. Anah Oldn, a civil servant in the Official Service for Broadcasting, Radio, Television and Public Performances (SODRE), as well as in connection with the situation of the workers affiliated to the Association of Workers of the National Transport Directorate of the Ministry of Transport and Public Works, the Government states that it has requested information on these state dependencies, which it will submit shortly. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Government states that civil servants enjoy the highest guarantees, both in the administrative sphere and the legal channels, which are absolutely independent of any kind of influence from the administrative authority.
.Lastly, with reference to COFE s allegations regarding civil servants in the electoral court, the Government states that the problem raised in no way relates to matters of freedom of association in its broadest sense and therefore falls beyond the natural remit of the Committee (the Government states that the issue in question is the right to petition as exercised by a group of non-affiliated civil servants requesting the revocation of a circular regulating the right to recourse to referendum on national legislation). This controversy has been brought before the administrative court in order to resolve the matter.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged absence of collective bargaining in the central administration, the Committee reiterates that Article  of the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Uruguay in , provides that it ""applies to all branches of economic activity"" and that ""as regards the public service, special modalities of application of this Convention may be fixed by national laws or regulations or national practice"", and Article  provides that ""the term collective bargaining extends to all negotiations which take place between an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more workers' organizations, on the other, for determining working conditions and terms of employment"". In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure full application of Convention No.  and promote collective bargaining also in the central public administration through appropriate mechanisms, in consultation with the trade union organizations concerned.(b) With regard to the allegations relating to the unilateral imposition by the Government of working conditions which affect civil servants through the promulgation of laws or decrees, the Committee underlines that, although the measures which countries adopt as part of the process of state reform pertain essentially to the competence of the public authority, insofar as such measures may affect the terms and conditions of employment of civil servants or public sector workers (as seems to be the case with the laws and decrees cited by the complainants) their organizations should be consulted before such legislation is adopted. The Committee urges the Government to promote consultations with the organizations concerned in cases of this nature and to take into account the principles mentioned in the conclusions.(c) With regard to the alleged acts of anti-union discrimination relating to the salary reductions imposed on union officials Ms. Leonor Quefan and Ms. Anah Oldn, and the disciplinary measures taken against workers affiliated to the Association of Workers of the National Transport Directorate of the Ministry of Transport and Public Works after its assembly had resolved to undertake industrial action, the Committee, observing that the allegations refer to events which occurred in the central public administration more than eight months ago, regrets the absence of observations from the Government and requests it to send its observations in this respect as soon as possible.",0,2003,Uruguay

.Under the first of these decrees, the central administration is totally prohibited from contracting any personnel under a contract for works, contract for services, casual, seasonal, temporary or of any other kind of contract which in any way involves a service of a personal nature, whether under an individual or collective contract, with a natural person, with or through de facto or commercial companies or any private entity whether or not it has legal personality either through provision of services or budgetary allocations administered by the State or through international organizations, and instructing the executive board or governing body of the organizations listed in article  of the Constitution of the Republic accordingly. The second decree suspends the payment of overtime in the central administration, and for officials in the organizations listed in article  of the Constitution of the Republic.
.The complainant organizations add that article  of Law No.  of  January  provides for the creation of the Permanent Commission on Labour Relations in the Central Administration and Organizations listed in article  of the Constitution of the Republic, under the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, with the specific assignment to advise on wages, conditions of employment and other matters regulated by international labour conventions. The law further provides that the Commission shall have five members: two representatives of the executive power through the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and the Planning and Budget Office, two nominated by the most representative organizations of public servants and the Minister of Labour and Social Security, or his representative, in the chair. The Commission may be convened by any of its members.
.The complainant organizations allege that the abovementioned Commission, which should have had a permanent organization to allow the public servants' representatives to participate in determining conditions of employment, has not been established and does not function in any organized way.
.The complainants add that the Government s practice of not having workers' organizations participate in issues of interest to the workers was compounded by the Government s decision that there would be no collective bargaining in the state public enterprise sector, which in practice means discarding agreements reached in the collective agreements concluded in the past with the Coordinating Committee of Enterprise Trade Unions on macro issues, and specifically in each of those state enterprises individually. The complainants state that there are no forums in the public administration for collective bargaining as envisaged in ILO Convention No. , and any that remain in effect under article  of Law No.  do not function for lack of stimulus and promotion by the Government which is in breach of its obligation to promote collective bargaining on wages, conditions of work and employment levels in the sector.
.The complainants add that the practice current in state commercial and industrial enterprises, whereby collective agreements including internal dispute settlement mechanisms, provisions on determination of conditions of work and wage adjustments had been formalized, had been abandoned.
.Lastly, the complainants indicate that as well as not encouraging collective bargaining throughout the public sector and particularly state enterprises, wage reductions are being intensified, new conditions of work are being fixed which undermine the gains of collective bargaining, everyday measures to reduce employment levels are announced, mechanisms for adjusting wages and forms of contracting are being deregulated and there is growing evidence of disregard not only for agreements reached through collective bargaining, but also the very right to engage in trade union activity.
.In another letter dated June , the Association of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries Officials (AFGAP) and InterUnion Workers' Assembly ' National Confederation of Workers (PIT-CNT) say that the officials of the Animal Health Division of the Uruguayan Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, through the local branch of AFGAP, decided in June  to engage in trade union action in the context of the trade union dispute with the authorities of that Ministry, because of non-payment of overtime actually performed. In that context, it was decided: (a) that each responsible official would not send zoo sanitary information relating to the service s activity to the Ministry s central office; (b) to work to rule; and (c) to strike on  June .
.The complainants report that after notifying the officials in dispute, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security decided, on  July , to declare the services and functions of various offices of the Animal Health Division in the Directorate-General of Livestock Services to be essential services, and ordered that the decision would remain in force for the duration of the trade union action described above, and for a period of  days.
.The complainant organizations add that the administrative authority stated that  ...the trade union actions seriously affected sanitary control throughout the Republic, compromising the proper guarantees of public health and harmed production, marketing, imports and exports, causing a serious obstacle to the normal functioning of national production'  The authority further failed to send the information described as  ...an attack on the fulfilment of the international obligations assumed by the country ' and various bilateral treaties and agreements ' which resulted in serious harm to the national economy  ? The complainant organizations consider that this specific case is not one where it is possible to limit the exercise of trade union activity.
.The complainants add that although it is true that the obligations of the Animal Health Division of the Directorate-General of Livestock Services in the Ministry are to prevent, control and eradicate serious animal diseases, and in that respect to register and monitor commercial animal producers, as well as taking health certification measures, it is also obvious that, although at the time of the dispute in question a state of health emergency for foot-and-mouth disease had been declared, the trade union actions taken did not endanger the life, health or security of any part of the population, as can be seen from the relevant technical reports. The measures adopted did not mean abandoning the tasks of prevention, control, certification and actions to eradicate the epidemic, but consisted of not submitting the information gathered to the central Ministry, and in taking strike action on  June , in a context of planned mobilization. The attitude of the officials of the Animal Health Division involved in the dispute, far from straying outside their responsibility to combat the foot-and-mouth epidemic, let alone endanger the life and health of the population as a whole, was about defending the right to receive compensation or remuneration for overtime actually worked, before, during and after the period of health emergency.
.In its letter dated  January , the Government states that with respect to the alleged non-compliance with Convention No. , there is total freedom to form trade unions in the public sector, and, indeed, that collective agreements have been concluded in many state enterprises on conditions of employment in general. The Government points out that both the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Committee of Freedom of Association are aware that there are no legal restrictions whatsoever in Uruguay on the formation of trade unions or collective bargaining. Furthermore, both private and public sector trade unions are recognized as having de facto legal personality to engage in collective bargaining and indeed the trade union representatives of public officials have concluded many collective agreements, especially in commercial and industrial enterprises, the banking sector and departmental governments.
.As regards the alleged failure by the Government to convene the Permanent Commission on Labour Relations for the Central Administration and other Organizations, created by article  of Law No. , the Government indicates that the Commission was extremely active in the period following its creation, but recently no joint meetings had been convened, and highlights that the law expressly provides that any of the interested parties may convene a meeting in relation to their own interests.",0,2002,Uruguay
57,"The fact is that none of the organizations has done so and the reason for this is quite apart from the Commission, public sector employment relations have functioned quite normally and state officials have the highest rates of trade union membership.
.With respect to the alleged failure to promote collective bargaining, the Government which took office on the restoration of democracy (March ) implemented a system whereby it was mandatory to convene employers and workers to wage bargaining every four months. That was a stage in promoting collective bargaining, necessary following a period when it had been absent and when high inflation needed to be offset by frequent wage adjustments. This stage was considered to end with the full re-establishment of individual and collective liberties and the decline in inflation rates from  per cent annually to less than  per cent in .
.Although the Government considers that mandatory convening of wage bargaining can be dispensed with, that does not mean that it is restricted in any way in any sector. On the contrary, as already stated, there are no requirements either for recognition of the capacity of the negotiating parties or the practical arrangements. It should be noted in particular that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security maintains a permanent team of experts who collaborate in any bargaining in which the parties may wish to engage. In this respect, we can say that, during the period -, there was free and open collective bargaining with state enterprises and government departments, and although it is true that there are no collective agreements in the central administration, the fact remains that various central government bodies set up bargaining forums which allowed trade unions to submit claims included by the administration in its corresponding budgetary allocations. An example of this is the Uruguayan Teachers' Federation (FUM) which undertook an energetic strategy of mobilization and participation in bodies responsible for transforming the sector. At the same time, we can mention the case of the Federation of Public Health Workers (FFSP) which during the period concerned participated in decisions on wage issues for the sector affecting the five-year budget and the law on submission of accounts. In state enterprises between  and , there were two areas of bargaining: a centralized one of a general character in the Planning and Budget Office and individual company-level bargaining.
.The Government reports that there was no break in centralized bargaining, and successive agreements were concluded in the National Ports Administration (ANP), the telecommunications sector (ANTEL), state factories (UTE), the National Postal Administration and the Social Security Bank (BPS), among others. During  and , the same pattern was maintained in the public sector. There were no collective agreements in the central administration and there was free bargaining in state enterprises and the state bank. At this level, it is interesting to note that the agreement signed by the National Fuel, Alcohol and Cement Company (ACAP) in March , which constitutes a new framework which will then be taken up in section agreements adapted to their goals and objectives. In the light of the foregoing, the Government states that there has been no failure to comply with the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the allegations submitted by the Association of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries Officials (AFGAP) on the declaration of essential service which affected some offices of the Animal Health Division of the Directorate-General of Livestock Services, the Government states that prior to its designation as an essential service, there were several meetings between workers' representatives and various authorities of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, as well as Ministry of Labour and Social Security officials in order to reconcile the parties to the dispute.
.The Government points out that the declaration of essential service in Uruguayan law does not mean that strikes are prohibited, but solely that there is a need to establish emergency shifts, such that the strike will only be illegal if it causes a total breakdown of the service. Article  of Law No.  does not prohibit strikes in essential services, but merely lays down restrictions.
.The Government adds that obviously the delicate situation faced by the country during the health alert caused by the appearance of foot-and-mouth disease led to a national emergency which justified the declaration of an essential service in the terms adopted, which in no way prevented the right to strike of the officials involved but merely restricted it to a requirement to provide minimum services, which does not impair enjoyment of that right. Moreover, the Government states that the possibility allowed in article  of Law No.  is considered as an exceptional power bearing in mind that the mechanism has rarely been invoked.
.With respect to the allegations by the Confederation of Civil Service Unions (COFE) on the non-convening of the Permanent Commission on Labour Relations in the Central Administration and Organizations listed in article  of the Constitution of the Republic, the Government points out that article  of Law No.  allows any of the parties to convene it.
.The Government indicates that the allegations against Decrees Nos.  and  of  May  issued by the executive power on reduction in public expenditure do not deserve further comment. According to the Government, it is sufficient to read the international legislation to realize that in no case have international standards ratified by the country been infringed. The Government considers that the prohibition on the central administration of generating overtime or recruiting people under a contract for works, contract for services, casual, seasonal, temporary or of any other kind of contract is nothing more than the State controlling its own public spending and does not require prior authorization or consultation.
.The Committee observes that in this case: () the Government is alleged to have violated Conventions Nos.  and  in having issued decrees which affect conditions of employment of public officials, without consulting their representative organizations and because there are no forums in the public administration to allow collective bargaining; and () it is alleged that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security decided in the context of a strike to declare as essential services the services and functions of various offices of the Animal Health Division of the Directorate-General of Livestock Services in the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries.
.As regards the allegations of violation by the Government of Conventions Nos.  and  by virtue of: (i) the issue of Decrees Nos.  and  (whereby according to the complainants contracting any personnel under a contract for works, contract for services, casual, seasonal, temporary or of any other kind of contract which in any way involves a service of a personal nature is prohibited and suspension of payment of overtime in the central administration); (ii) the failure to convene the Permanent Commission on Employment Relations in the Central Administration and listed Organizations ' consisting of members of the executive power and members of the most representative officials' organizations ' whose purpose is to advise on wages issues, conditions of employment and other matters regulated by international labour conventions; and (iii) abandonment of the practice of negotiating collective agreements in state enterprises. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government stated the following: () Decrees Nos.  and  of  refer to reduction of public expenditure and control by the State of its public spending which does not require prior authorization or consultation; () the law allows any of the members to convene the Permanent Commission on Labour Relations in the central administration and listed organizations; () since , there has been free and open collective bargaining with state enterprises and government departments, and although there were no collective agreements in the central administration, various central government bodies set up bargaining forums which allowed trade unions to submit claims included by the administration in its corresponding budgetary allocations.
.In the first place, in relation to the Decrees to which the complainants object (Nos.  and ) the Committee considers that, although the measures adopted with the objective of reducing public expenditure are essentially within the purview of the executive power, to the extent that such measures may affect the conditions of employment of public sector officials or workers (as in the case of these Decrees), their organizations should be consulted prior to their adoption. The Committee requests the Government in future to consult the interested organizations prior to cases of this kind.
.In addition, as to the non-existence of collective bargaining in the central administration (according to the Government, collective bargaining is free in other areas of the public sector), the Committee recalls that Article  of the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Uruguay in  provides that it  applies to all branches of economic activity' and that  as regards the public service, special modalities of application of this Convention may be fixed by national laws or regulations or national practice' and Article  provides that  the term",0,2002,Uruguay
58,"collective bargaining extends to all negotiations which take place between an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more workers' organizations, on the other, for determining working conditions and terms of employment'  In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure full application of Convention No.  and promote collective bargaining also in the central public administration through appropriate mechanisms, in consultation with the trade union organizations concerned.
.As regards the complainants' objections to the decision adopted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to declare as essential services the services and functions of various offices of the Animal Health Division of the Directorate-General of Livestock Services in the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries in the context of a strike in June , the Committee observes that the Government states that: () prior to the declaration as an essential service, the Ministry held several meetings between workers' representatives and authorities of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries with a view to reconciling the parties to the dispute; () the declaration of an essential service in Uruguayan law does not mean a prohibition of the strike but only the need to establish emergency shifts; () Law No.  does not prohibit strikes in essential services, but merely lays down restrictions; and () the delicate situation faced by the country during the health alert caused by the appearance of foot-and-mouth disease led to a national emergency which justified the declaration of an essential service in the terms adopted, which in no way prevented the right to strike of the officials involved but merely restricted it to a requirement to provide minimum services. In this respect, although the complainant organization alleges that the measures adopted did not mean abandoning the tasks of prevention, control, certification and actions to eradicate the epidemic, it also recognizes that a state of health emergency was in effect in the country. In this context, the Committee considers that the decision adopted by the Government to declare the Animal Health Division an essential service, for the purpose of requiring a minimum service, in the face of an outbreak of a highly contagious disease (foot and mouth) does not violate the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of the above conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government in the future, when it envisages adopting measures to reduce public expenditure which may affect the conditions of employment of public sector officials or employees, to consult the organizations concerned prior to their adoption.(b) With respect to the right of collective bargaining of officials of the central administration, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure the full application of Convention No.  and promote collective bargaining in the central public administration through appropriate mechanisms, in consultation with the trade union organizations concerned.",0,2002,Uruguay

.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee once again requests the Government to indicate, without delay, why the CASMU preventively suspended  workers from their duties without pay and instituted proceedings against them, and whether, on reinstatement, they were paid the wages withheld during the five days that the examination proceedings lasted.(b) With regard to the institution of administrative proceedings and subsequent dismissal of Graciela Sadi, Daniel Fernndez, Julio Csar Ximnez, Hctor Pereira and Cyro Simoes allegedly because of their participation in a protest against the President of the Republic, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the administrative investigation being carried out by the General Labour Inspectorate concludes without delay and, should it show that the dismissals arose as a result of the participation of the trade union members in the protest, that it take steps to ensure the workers' reinstatement in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to send it all decisions handed down in this respect.
.In its letter of  December , the Government states that following the Committee s recommendations, it sent a note to the CASMU management asking whether it had suspended  workers without pay and instituted administrative proceedings against them, and specifically whether they were paid for the five days that the proceedings lasted. The Government reports that CASMU s adviser informed it that the CASMU Board decided to drop the proceedings against these workers without making any adverse observations against the workers and that their wages had not been withheld for the five days of suspension that the proceedings lasted.
.With respect to the other allegations still pending, the Government reports that the General Labour Inspectorate, ex officio, instituted an administrative investigation concerning the dismissals in question. The Government indicates that in view of the fact the AFCASMU had indicated that the sanctioned workers were carrying out an activity decided by the trade union, the General Labour Inspectorate, by a decision of  July , ordered the AFCASMU to present the resolution adopted by the general assembly of  May which decided on the strike in compliance with which the workers subject to the proceedings were sanctioned by the CASMU Board. The Inspectorate concluded from the documents provided by CASMU, and the comments by AFCASMU concerning the documentation produced, that there was no evidence that the CASMU workers identified as having participated in a protest against the President of the Republic involving verbal abuse and physical assault were doing so in compliance with the industrial action ordered by AFCASMU and duly notified to the heads of the departments in which the workers were employed, nor that the sanction was based on political motives. This is admitted by AFCASMU which indicates that the workers participated in the protest in their half-hour break, and in their capacity as private citizens.
.The Government adds that, from the proceedings properly instituted at the time, there was no evidence that the four staff were using their break. In that circumstance, the General Labour Inspectorate concluded in its decision of  September  that  in this case it is not found that the summary proceedings initiated against the four workers who were absent from their posts without authorization and who were identified in a protest in which the President of the Republic was verbally abused and physically assaulted, wearing the uniform which linked them to their employer, were politically motivated or that the sanctions implied any obstruction of trade union activity.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Committee recalls that at its March  meeting, it requested the Government to indicate, without delay, why the Medical Assistance Centre of the Medical Trade Union (CASMU) preventively suspended  workers from their duties without pay and instituted proceedings against them, and whether, on reinstatement, they were paid the wages withheld during the five days that the examination proceedings lasted. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government reports that the CASMU Board decided to drop the proceedings against these workers without making any adverse observations against the workers and that their wages had not been withheld for the five days of suspension that the proceedings lasted. In this respect, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not require further examination.
.The Committee also recalls that concerning the allegations of the institution of summary proceedings and subsequent dismissal of Graciela Sadi, Daniel Fernndez, Julio Csar Ximnez, Hctor Pereira and Cyro Simoes for having participated in a protest during the visit of the President of the Republic, the Committee urged the Government to take steps to ensure that the administrative investigation being carried out by the General Labour Inspectorate concluded without delay and, should it show that the dismissals arose as a result of the participation of the trade union members in the protest, that it take steps to ensure the workers' reinstatement in their posts.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government states that the General Labour Inspectorate carried out an administrative investigation into the dismissals in question and that: () taking into account that the trade union AFCASMU indicated that the sanctioned workers were carrying out an activity decided by the trade union, it was asked to present the resolution adopting the strike action concerned; () from the documents presented by CASMU and the comments provided by the trade union AFCASMU, there was no evidence that the CASMU workers who participated in a protest against the President of the Republic in which he was verbally abused and physically assaulted did so in compliance with the industrial action ordered by AFCASMU, duly notified to the heads of the departments in which they were employed, nor that the sanction was politically motivated; () there is no evidence from the investigation that the workers in question were using their break, as indicated by AFCASMU; and () taking into account all of the above, the General Labour Inspectorate, by a decision of  September , concluded that there was no evidence in the event that the summary proceedings and sanctions imposed on the four workers who were absent from their posts without authorization and who were identified in a protest in which the President of the Republic was verbally abused and physically assaulted, implied any obstruction of trade union activity. In the light of the information sent by the Government, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not require further examination.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. AFCASMU submitted new allegations on  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) taking into account the circumstances of this case, the Committee requests the Government to indicate why the CASMU preventively suspended  workers from their duties without pay and instituted proceedings against them. Also, given that they were reinstated five days after the day of the partial strike, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether these workers were paid the wages withheld during the five days that the examination procedures lasted, and also whether these workers still run the risk of being punished or whether the disciplinary proceedings have been filed. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect; and(b) the Committee notes with concern the allegation relating to the proceedings instituted against five workers of the CASMU for having participated in a protest organized by the trade union outside the workplace in response to economic measures adopted by the Government, and requests the Government to communicate its observations in this respect without delay and in particular to inform it about the result of the proceedings in question.
.In its communication of  June , the complainant organization, referring to subparagraph (b) of the Committee s recommendations, alleges the dismissal of Graciela Sadi, Daniel Fernndez, Julio Csar Ximnez, Hctor Pereira and Cyro Simoes in June , against whom proceedings had been instituted for having participated in a protest during the visit of the President of the Republic to a teaching facility near the workplace.
.In its communication of  December , the Government indicates, with regard to the administrative proceedings carried out by the technical/administrative management of the CASMU and the suspension without pay of the workers who participated in the",-1,2002,Uruguay
60,"strike of  January , that these proceedings concluded on  January  with the decision to lift the preventive suspension of the workers and reinstate them to their posts. For this reason and taking into account that, with the workers having been reinstated, there no longer existed any threat of infringement of rights, the appeal for legal protection (an exceptional and unusual recourse) lodged by the complainant organization was refused, leaving the parties with the possibility of ordinary judicial recourse. The Government adds that the labour inspectorate has received no complaint and that it will keep the Committee informed of any ordinary judicial proceedings begun by the complainant organization.
.With regard to the proceedings against five trade union members for their participation in a protest against the President of the Republic, the Government states that it has notified the management of the CASMU to provide information on the means of dismissal adopted and the General Labour Inspectorate so that it may carry out an administrative investigation without a complaint having been laid, and that once it has received this information it will inform the Committee.
.The Committee notes that the present complaint refers to: () the institution of administrative proceedings and the suspension without pay of  of the  workers who took part in a strike on  January  at the Assistance Centre of the Medical Trade Union of Uruguay (CASMU) because of persistent delays in payment of wages and the failure to pay holiday pay; and () the institution of administrative proceedings and the subsequent dismissal of five trade union members, Graciela Sadi, Daniel Fernndez, Julio Csar Ximnez, Hctor Pereira and Cyro Simoes, because of their participation in a protest against the President of the Republic outside working hours.
.The Committee recalls that in its previous examination of the case it had requested the Government to indicate why the CASMU preventively suspended  workers from their duties without pay and instituted proceedings against them, and also to indicate whether, once these workers were reinstated, they were paid the wages withheld during the five days that the examination proceedings lasted. The Committee regrets to note that, in spite of the time that has passed since its last examination of the case (November ), the Government has not provided the requested information and has merely repeated the reasons why the appeal for protection (which is an exceptional and unusual recourse) was refused because these workers were reinstated and that the parties had the possibility of ordinary judicial recourse. The Committee, once again, requests the Government to send the information requested without delay.
.With regard to the administrative proceedings and subsequent dismissal of Graciela Sadi, Daniel Fernndez, Julio Csar Ximnez, Hctor Pereira and Cyro Simoes allegedly because of their participation in a protest against the President of the Republic, the Committee also regrets to note that in spite of the lengthy period of time that has passed since its last examination of the case, the Government has confined itself to providing the information that it has notified the CASMU to provide information on these measures and has notified the General Labour Inspectorate so that it may begin an administrative investigation without any complaint having been laid. The Committee recalls that it is contrary to the principles of freedom of association that trade union members be dismissed as a result of their participation in protest actions, which, according to what can be deduced from the present case, took place peacefully. The Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the administrative investigation concludes without delay and should it show that the dismissals arose as a result of the participation of the trade union members in the protest, that it take steps to ensure the workers' reinstatement in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to send it all decisions handed down in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee once again requests the Government to indicate, without delay, why the CASMU preventively suspended  workers from their duties without pay and instituted proceedings against them, and whether, on reinstatement, they were paid the wages withheld during the five days that the examination proceedings lasted.(b) With regard to the institution of administrative proceedings and subsequent dismissal of Graciela Sadi, Daniel Fernndez, Julio Csar Ximnez, Hctor Pereira and Cyro Simoes allegedly because of their participation in a protest against the President of the Republic, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the administrative investigation being carried out by the General Labour Inspectorate concludes without delay and, should it show that the dismissals arose as a result of the participation of the trade union members in the protest, that it take steps to ensure the workers' reinstatement in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to send it all decisions handed down in this respect.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Staff Association of the CASMU (AFCASMU) dated  January . The AFCASMU sent further allegations in a communication dated  June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January , the Staff Association of the CASMU (Assistance Centre of the Medical Trade Union of Uruguay) ' AFCASMU ' alleges that it was the target of a clear measure of trade union repression following direct action decided on by the sovereign general assembly of the association on  January .
.The AFCASMU explains that for over three years the CASMU, a mutual institution, has been paying its workers' salaries late, sometimes with delays extending up to three months (the salaries are paid in instalments), and more recently it has stopped providing holiday pay. This situation deteriorated further during the last few months of . As a result, during an assembly meeting on  January  the workers decided on a series of trade union measures to address the matter, and also on corrective measures to improve the operation of the health-care system. These measures included the following:  that either on  January all wages are paid or on  January the operating-room staff and the equipment centre staff of Sanatorium  will not attend work; that the entire executive committee of AFCASMU, advised and supported by the first-level committee of this sanatorium and colleagues from other places who wish to provide their support, will be at the door; that the following month, if all non-medical wages have not yet been paid, there will be a ?hour strike in all the surgical blocks and equipment centres'  This measure was decided by a majority and communicated in due time and form on  January to the institutional authorities. It should be pointed out that whenever measures are taken in any of the areas of assistance, a trade union presence is maintained to man the emergency rooms and this is what happened on the occasion in question. Given that the salaries were not paid on  January (with November and December being owed), the measure was carried out in the surgical block and equipment centre of Sanatorium  with members of the trade union remaining on duty from midnight to midnight on  January according to a roster established by the union. For the record, all the staff were located in the dining room of Sanatorium  in case it was necessary to replace those on duty. The duty roster mentioned was coordinated with the official in charge of the surgical block. Also present was the director of the sanatorium, who did not report any irregularities in respect of emergencies.
.The AFCASMU alleges that the technical/administrative management of the CASMU decided the same day to send a memo to  of the  workers who participated in the action to inform them of their preventive suspension from duties without pay and of the decision to institute proceedings against them. It should be noted that this decision was endorsed by the board of directors of the CASMU, a political body of institutional management, following a meeting held with the trade union during which it explained the circumstances in which the measure decided by the assembly was implemented. The CASMU decision was communicated to the AFCASMU in a fax on  January.
.The AFCASMU adds that on  January the trade union met in a mass general assembly and decided, inter alia, to submit an appeal for the protection of its constitutional rights to the judiciary requesting that the suspension of the  workers and the withholding of wages as a result of their participation in trade union activities be declared null and void. It also decided to file a complaint with the Ministry of Labour and the ILO (Committee on Freedom of Association).
.In a communication dated  June , the",1,2002,Uruguay
61,"complainant organization alleges that as a result of a protest conducted outside the workplace in response to economic measures adopted by the Government, the authorities of this body decided to institute proceedings against five workers who participated in the protest (Ms. Sadi, Mr. Daniel Fernndez, Mr. Julio Csar Ximens, Mr. Hctor Pereira and Mr. Cyro Simoes).
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that it has consulted both the General Labour Inspectorate and the National Labour Directorate concerning the complaint in question and has found no reference whatsoever to the dispute.
.The Government adds that the Staff Association of the CASMU (AFCASMU), in accordance with trade union action approved by the general assembly of the AFCASMU, decided on Thursday,  January  that if after  January the CASMU had not paid the wages owed to the staff, it would conduct a partial sector-specific strike in the department of the surgical block and the equipment centre of Sanatorium . As the wages owed had not been paid by  January, a strike was conducted from midnight to midnight with a trade union presence in place according to a duty roster.
.On  January, in accordance with a resolution handed down by its board of directors, the CASMU decided on the examination proceedings (which were to finish by  January) concerning the workers involved in the trade union action and the suspension from duties with full retention of pay during the period of the examination proceedings. The workers considered that this decision infringed on the following fundamental rights: freedom of association and the right to strike, which in this case consisted of an atypical form of sector-level strike.
.On  January the trade union decided to lodge an appeal for the protection of its constitutional rights to the judiciary requesting that the suspension of the  workers and the withholding of wages owing to their involvement in trade union action be declared null and void.
.The examination proceedings were completed on  January, the preventive suspension was lifted and a call was made for a return to usual duties. Consequently, the workers returned to work.
.A trade union hearing was held, for which provision is made in appeals for the protection of constitutional rights. The judicial authority, following the witnesses' statements and considering the fact that the CASMU had reinstated its workers, declared that  there is no sign of a potential infringement of a right, nor of irreparable damage and, in addition, an ordinary procedure is in place whereby possible disciplinary sanctions that the defendant might have imposed on the plaintiffs can be reviewed'  and dismissed the appeal for protection.
.Consequently, in principle the Ministry of Labour would not have any objections to make to the result of the appeal for the protection of constitutional rights and would like to be informed of any information the workers might provide concerning the result of the proceedings.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that on  January  the Assistance Centre of the Medical Trade Union of Uruguay preventively suspended from duties, without pay, and ordered that proceedings be instituted against,  workers as a means of trade union repression following direct trade union action (more specifically, the failure of the operating-room and equipment centre staff to attend work on  January , although emergency rooms were kept in service by means of trade union duty rosters and all the staff were present in the dining room in case it was necessary to replace those on duty). The complainant organization explains that  workers participated in this action and that the action was taken because for over three years the CASMU has been behind by up to three months in its payment of wages to its workers and that more recently it had also failed to pay for holidays.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that this constituted a partial sector-level strike and that it confirmed the failure to pay the wages owed as well as the suspension from duties without pay during the examination proceedings ordered by the institution. The Committee notes that once the examination proceedings had been completed the preventive suspension was lifted and that on  January  the workers were invited to return to their duties, and all the workers who had been suspended from their duties were reinstated. The Government sends a copy of the judgement on the appeal for the protection of constitutional rights dated  January  where this appeal is dismissed  without any special convictions'  in particular given the nature of the appeal (which takes place  when there is an infringement or imminent threat of an infringement to a right or freedom which causes or will bring about irreparable damage if the formalities corresponding to the usual instruments are adhered to'  and taking into account that the officials in question were reinstated and that  an ordinary procedure is in place whereby possible disciplinary sanctions that the defendant might have imposed on the plaintiffs can be reviewed' 
.The Committee has considered that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ] and has deemed the hospital sector to be an essential service [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee has considered possible the establishment of minimum services in the case of strike action in essential services in the strict sense of the term [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee observes that in Uruguay strikes are not prohibited in the hospital sector and that in this case minimum services were maintained.
.In the circumstances of this case, the Committee requests the Government to indicate why the CASMU preventively suspended  workers from their duties without pay and instituted proceedings against them. Also, given that they were reinstated five days after the day of the partial strike, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether these workers were paid the wages withheld during the five days that the examination proceedings lasted, and also whether these workers still run the risk of being punished or whether the disciplinary proceedings have been filed. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Lastly, the Committee notes with concern the allegation relating to the proceedings instituted against five workers of the CASMU for having participated in a protest organized by the trade union outside the workplace in response to economic measures adopted by the Government, and requests the Government to communicate its observations in this respect without delay and in particular to inform it about the result of the proceedings in question.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Government Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Taking into account the circumstances of this case, the Committee requests the Government to indicate why the CASMU preventively suspended  workers from their duties without pay and instituted proceedings against them. Also, given that they were reinstated five days after the day of the partial strike, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether these workers were paid the wages withheld during the five days that the examination proceedings lasted, and also whether these workers still run the risk of being punished or whether the disciplinary proceedings have been filed. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee notes with concern the allegation relating to the proceedings instituted against five workers of the CASMU for having participated in a protest organized by the trade union outside the workplace in response to economic measures adopted by the Government, and requests the Government to communicate its observations in this respect without delay and in particular to inform it about the result of the proceedings in question.",1,2002,Uruguay
62,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Departmental Association of Public Employees of Canelones (ADEOM) of  June . This communication was followed by a number of documents that supported the complaint. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to adopt the following recommendations:(a) The Committee concludes that the Municipal Administration of Canelones acted in an anti-union manner by unilaterally and arbitrarily ceasing to deduct the trade union dues of the complainant organization and urges it to deduct the trade union dues of those members who have stated their agreement to this in any form. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any new ruling on this matter.(b) Regarding Service Order No. /, which allows trade union leave only for members of the departmental committee of the complainant organization, or their deputies, the Committee notes that the Government will provide information in this respect following the processing of the administrative proceedings and the measures that may be taken. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",0,2001,Uruguay
63,".The Committee last examined this case at its meeting of November  [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion it expressed the hope that the Court of Administrative Proceedings would issue a ruling in the near future on the appeals lodged against the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate Decree of  April , which sanctioned the Savings and Loans Cooperative of Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA) for having dismissed workers because of their trade union membership, and requested the Government to keep it informed of the ruling.
.By a communication of  May , the Government sent a copy of the ruling handed down by the Court of Administrative Proceedings in  CAOFA v/the State ' Ministry of Labour and Social Security'  upholding the impugned decision (the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate Decree penalizing CAOFA with a fine for breach of Conventions Nos  and ).
.The Committee takes due note of this information.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in November  [see rd Report, paras  and ] and at that time requested the Government to keep it informed of the ruling of the Court of Administrative Proceedings with regard to the appeals lodged against the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate Decree of  April , which sanctioned the Savings and Loans Cooperative of Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA) for having dismissed workers because of their trade union membership.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government reports that the Court of Administrative Proceedings has still not issued a ruling on the appeals lodged against the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate Decree of  April , as the documents are still being examined by the judges of the court. The Government adds that in the context of the proceedings, the State Prosecutor to the Court of Administrative Proceedings indicated in his report of  November  that he believes the appeal will be rejected and the allegations will be confirmed; nevertheless, the court is the competent authority and it will rule as it sees fit.
.The Committee notes this information and hopes that the Court of Administrative Proceedings will issue a ruling in the near future regarding the dismissal of workers because of their trade union membership, and it requests the Government to keep it informed of the ruling.
.The Committee has previously examined the substance of this case at its May-June , May-June  and March  meetings, at which times it presented interim reports to the Government Body [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (June ); th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ); and rd Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )]. The Government has sent new observations in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In this case, it is alleged that, when the unionized workers of the Savings and Loans Cooperative of Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA) decided that the trade union at the CAOFA needed to affiliate to the complainant organization, the CAOFA denounced the collective labour agreement that was in force at the time, and which had been concluded with the union in question. Following this, it dismissed six trade union leaders, transferred another trade unionist to a different position and threatened to dismiss the workers who intended to retain their affiliation to the AEBU. In light of the interim conclusions given by the Committee when it last examined the case, the Governing Body approved the following recommendations at its March  session [see rd Report, para. ]:(a) Noting that both the judicial authority and the administrative authority have established that the dismissal of the six trade union members in question arose as a result of their trade union membership, the Committee considers that this case involves a serious violation of trade union rights and, in these circumstances: () it requests the Government to provide information on which the legal decision of July  has been carried out; () it requests the Government to take measures to expedite the administrative appeals lodged against the administrative decision of April  and to provide information on the outcome; and () it once again requests the Government to mediate immediately between the parties in order to obtain the reinstatement without loss of pay of those workers affected.(b) The Committee regrets to note that the Government makes no reference to the allegations relating to: (i) the denouncement of the collective agreement by the CAOFA once it became aware of the intentions of union leaders of the cooperative to become affiliated to the AEBU; (ii) the transfer to trade union member Virginia Orrego; and (iii) the threats to dismiss workers who joined the AEBU. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to send its observations in this respect without delay.
.In its communication of  December , the Government provides the following, more detailed information on the situation with regard to the judicial and administrative proceedings under way at national level and relevant to this case.
.The CAOFA launched an appeal with regard to the decision of the Labour Court of First Instance (No. , dated  July ), noted by the Committee in its last examination of the case [see rd Report, para. ] concerning the dismissal of the six trade union representatives. The Court of Appeal passed a decision on  June , a copy of which has been sent by the Government. In this decision, the appeal court confirms the lower court s judgement with regard to the anti-union nature of the dismissals and the sentencing of the CAOFA to pay damages with interest ' a sentence with which the CAOFA has complied.
.With regard to the administrative proceedings, the complainant organization s allegation against the CAOFA, of which the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate has been informed, initially resulted in a decree from the Inspectorate, dated  April , penalizing the CAOFA for dismissing workers because of their trade union membership by fining it  variable units (equivalent to US$,) [see rd Report, para. ]. In regard to this, the Government states that the CAOFA lodged administrative appeals with both the Inspectorate and its immediate superior. These two appeals resulted in two decisions, dated  and  January  respectively, confirming the decree of  April  (the Government encloses copies of the decisions). Having exhausted the administrative options, the CAOFA has lodged an appeal with the Court of Administrative Proceedings to have the decree revoked. These proceedings are currently at the evidence gathering stage; in fact, the Court has ordered an on-site inspection in accordance with the notice received by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on  December . The Government will communicate the Court s judgement to the Committee as soon as it has been given.
.Regarding the reinstatement of the dismissed workers, the Government reiterates that Uruguay has no legal provisions under which it would be possible to force the enterprise to reinstate the dismissed workers, and that this has been confirmed numerous times by the national courts. For instance, in its Judgement No.  of  August , the Supreme Court ruled that an employer could not be constrained to reinstate [a worker] in the absence of an explicit text stipulating this obligation. The Government encloses several examples of this fact from case law with its reply.
.In respect of the allegations concerning the denouncement of the collective agreement by the CAOFA, the transfer of Ms. Virginia Orrego and the threats to dismiss workers affiliated to the complainant organization, the Government claims that all of these aspects of the case were denounced during the administrative proceedings that took place before the general labour inspection that resulted in the appropriate penalty for violation of freedom of association being imposed. The Government adds that a judicial appeal was made concerning Ms. Orrego s case, which resulted in decisions vindicating her in both the first instance and the appeal courts. According to the information received by the Government from the complainant organization, these decisions were respected by the CAOFA, which thus paid the special compensation required of it. The Government states that it will keep the Committee informed of all developments relating to this case.
.The Committee recalls that the complainant organization alleged: (i) the denouncement of the collective agreement in force at the time by the Savings and Loans Cooperative of Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA) when the management of this enterprise became aware of the intentions of trade union leaders at the enterprise to affiliate to the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU); (ii) the dismissal of several trade union members (Mr. Nelson Corbo, Mr. Eduardo Cevallos, Mr. Gonzalo Ribas, Mr. Andrea Oyharbide, Mr. Gerardo Olivieri and Mr. Marcelo Almadia) and the",1,2000,Uruguay
64,"transfer of a unionized worker (Ms. Virginia Orrego); and (iii) threats to dismiss workers who were members of the AEBU. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that, at its March  meeting, it requested the Government to provide information on whether the legal decision of  July  had been carried out, to take measures to expedite the administrative appeals lodged by the CAOFA against the administrative decision of  April  by the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate and provide information on the outcome and, lastly, to mediate between the parties in order to obtain the reinstatement without loss of pay of those workers affected. The Committee also requested the Government to provide its observations on the allegations concerning the denouncement of the collective agreement by the CAOFA, the transfer of Ms. Virginia Orrego and the threats to dismiss workers who were members of the AEBU.
.Regarding the issue of dismissals, the Committee recalls that the dismissal of the six trade union representatives has been examined in two parallel sets of proceedings ' one judicial and one administrative. These two proceedings led to the same conclusion ' that the dismissals were anti-union in nature ' and resulted in two decisions dealing with two aspects of national-level protection against anti-union discrimination: rectification of the loss to the victims by the judicial proceedings, and the imposition of a penalty by the administrative proceedings.
.In respect of the judicial proceedings, the Committee notes the Government s statement that Decision No.  of  July  of the Labour Court of First Instance was confirmed by the Court of Appeal, with regard both to the anti-union nature of the dismissals and to the requirement that the CAOFA pay damages with interest. In view of the fact that over five years have elapsed since the six workers were dismissed, and that they have been paid damages with interest, the Committee takes note of the decision of the Court of Appeal.
.Regarding the administrative proceedings, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the decree of  April  of the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate punishing the CAOFA for dismissing the workers because of their trade union membership has been confirmed following two judicial appeals. This decree is at present the subject of an administrative action which is currently at the evidence-gathering stage, and the competent court has ordered an on-site inspection. The Committee requests the Government to do all in its power without delay in order that the appeals of the CAOFA against the decree of  April  of the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate result in a definitive decision as soon as possible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the transfer of Ms. Virginia Orrego, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the CAOFA was required to pay her special compensation and that this payment has been made. However, the Committee requests the Government to verify that Ms. Virginia Orrego has been returned to the position that she occupied at the time of her transfer or to another equivalent post appropriate to her qualifications and experience, if the court establishes that this transfer had anti-union motives. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.Finally, with regard to the allegations relating to the denouncement of the collective agreement by the CAOFA and to the threats to dismiss workers who were members of the complainant organization, the Committee takes note of the Government s claim that these aspects of the case were denounced in the administrative proceedings which took place before the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate ' proceedings which led to the imposition of the appropriate penalty for violation of freedom of association. Nevertheless, the Committee requests the Government to provide it with information on the current trade union situation in the CAOFA and, in particular, on the following aspects: () the possibility for workers to join an organization of their choice in practice, and, in particular, to join the complainant organization, without fear of reprisals, and the question of which trade union is currently active in the cooperative; () the situation with regard to collective bargaining and, in particular, to the conclusion of a collective agreement.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to do all in its power without delay in order that the appeals of the CAOFA against the decree of  April  of the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate result in a definitive decision as soon as possible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to verify that Ms. Virginia Orrego has been returned to the position that she occupied at the time of her transfer or to another equivalent post appropriate to her qualifications and experience, if the court establishes that this transfer had anti-union motives. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) The Committee requests the Government to provide it with information on the current trade union situation in the CAOFA and, in particular, on the following aspects: () the possibility for workers to join an organization of their choice in practice, and, in particular, to join the complainant organization, without fear of reprisals, and the question of which trade union is currently active in the cooperative; () the situation with regard to collective bargaining and, in particular, to the conclusion of a collective agreement.
.The Committee last examined this case at its May-June  meeting and on that occasion submitted an interim report [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th meeting (June )]. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that, in the present case, the complainant organization had alleged: (i) that the Savings and Loans Cooperative for Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA) denounced the collective agreement in force once it became aware of the intentions of union leaders of the cooperative to become affiliated to the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU); (ii) the dismissal of members of this trade union (Nelson Corbo, Eduardo Cevallos, Gonzalo Ribas, Andrea Oyharbide, Gerardo Olivieri and Marcelo Almada) and the transfer of another member (Virginia Orrego); and (iii) that workers joining the AEBU were threatened with dismissal. Moreover, the Committee recalls that at its June  meeting, it requested the Government to take measures to ensure that the administrative investigation, of which it was informed in June , was immediately concluded, that the investigation covered all the allegations made by the complainant in the case and that the sanctions laid down in national legislation were applied, and to mediate between the parties in order to obtain the reinstatement of those workers affected.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that: () the judicial authority of the first instance, in July , sentenced the CAOFA to pay compensation for ordinary dismissal, plus compensation for abusive dismissal (with regard to abusive dismissal, the sentence indicated that  the complaint lodged should be conceded given that the nature of the plaintiffs' tasks, their participation in negotiations at the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, requesting regularization of their situation in the face of infringements by the employer, and their membership of the AEBU have been proven, and that it has not been proven, according to the judicial authority that the alleged restructuring was the reason for these dismissals'  () a decision handed down by the National Inspectorate for Labour and Social Security, dated April , penalized the CAOFA for having dismissed workers because of their trade union membership with a fine of  variable units ' the equivalent of US$, ' (this decision indicated that  it has been certified in decrees that the company carried out acts of anti-union discrimination that culminated in the dismissal of the trade union board' ; () that the CAOFA lodged administrative appeals against this decision; and () the administrative authority, as a result of the application of national law, is not in a position to reinstate the dismissed worker, even given the evidence of anti-union persecution.
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that  the dismissal of workers on grounds of membership of an organization or trade union activities violates the principles of freedom of association' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. Noting that both the judicial authority and the administrative authority had established that the dismissal of the six trade union members in question arose as a result of their trade union membership, the Committee believes that this case involves with a serious violation of trade union rights and, in these circumstances: () it requests the",1,2000,Uruguay
65,"Government to provide information on whether the legal decision of July  has been carried out; () it requests the Government to take measures to expedite the administrative appeals lodged by the CAOFA against the administrative decision of April  and provide information on the outcome; and () it once again requests the Government to mediate immediately between the parties in order to obtain the reinstatement without loss of pay of those workers affected.
.Finally, the Committee regrets to note that the Government makes no reference to the allegations relating to: (i) the denouncement of the collective agreement by the CAOFA once it became aware of the intentions of union leaders of the cooperative to become affiliated to the AEBU; (ii) the transfer of trade union member Virginia Orrego; and (iii) the threats to dismiss workers who joined the AEBU. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to send its observations in this respect without delay.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Noting that both the judicial authority and the administrative authority have established that the dismissal of the six trade union members in question arose as a result of their trade union membership, the Committee considers that this case involves a serious violation of trade union rights and, in these circumstances: () it requests the Government to provide information on whether the legal decision of July  has been carried out; () it requests the Government to take measures to expedite the administrative appeals lodged against the administrative decision of April  and to provide information on the outcome; and () it once again requests the Government to mediate immediately between the parties in order to obtain the reinstatement without loss of pay of those workers affected.(b) The Committee regrets to note that the Government makes no reference to the allegations relating to: (i) the denouncement of the collective agreement by the CAOFA once it became aware of the intentions of union leaders of the cooperative to become affiliated to the AEBU; (ii) the transfer of trade union member Virginia Orrego; and (iii) the threats to dismiss workers who joined the AEBU. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to send its observations in this respect without delay.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, at which time it submitted an interim report [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (June )]. The Government sent its observations in communications dated  August  and  January .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined this case, the Committee presented the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:Noting that the Government states that an administrative investigation is under way, initiated following a complaint lodged by the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) against the Savings and Loans Cooperative of Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA) for anti-union acts, the Committee requests the Government to:- take measures so that this investigation, started more than one year ago, is quickly concluded;- ensure that the investigation covers all the allegations made by the complainant in this case;- take measures, if during this investigation the allegations are found to be true, so that: (i) workers dismissed on trade union grounds or transferred are reinstated immediately in their jobs, with the payment of back wages; and (ii) in the future, the respect of established collective agreements is fully guaranteed at CAOFA as well as that of legal provisions against acts of anti-union discrimination; and- transmit information on the results of the investigation and any measures adopted.
.In communications dated  August  and  January , the Government stated that the following stages of the administrative investigation had been reached:(a) statements in their defence have been received from the Savings and Loans Cooperative for Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA), in which they deny having taken and implemented any decisions on the grounds of anti-union discrimination, and that these decisions were a result of a process of restructuring and rescuing the enterprise from the economic and financial situation in which it had been left by the outgoing executive committee. As proof of this they state that there is a penal denunciation under way against the outgoing executive committee for alleged fraudulent management, and that there is a request before a commercial court to negotiate a legal arrangement with creditors to avoid bankruptcy;(b) on  November , the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security (the division responsible for investigating the complaint) considered the hearing of the enterprise concluded and ordered the taking of evidence from the parties, consisting of testimony from the plaintiff and the results to date of the legal proceedings from the defendant. At the same time, it set the date of  November ,  p.m., for receiving the testimonial evidence mentioned above, and reminded the plaintiff organization that it was responsible for producing the chosen witnesses;(c) the plaintiff, the enterprise and the civil servants' association of the CAOFA were notified of this date, and on  November official communications were sent to the two courts, requesting them to send copies of the relevant proceedings taking place before them;(d) on  November  the testimonial evidence was not heard as neither the parties summoned nor the witnesses appeared in court;(e) since then, the file has remained at the disposition of the parties, but not one has shown any active interest in following this up. At the end of June , given the seriousness of the complaints and acting under Decree No. / of the executive authority governing the administrative proceedings of the central administration, the Inspector-General of Labour and Social Security officially decided to continue the hearing of testimonial evidence submitted by the parties. To this effect, it was decided to hold a new hearing to receive testimonial evidence and the parties were so notified; this hearing has not yet taken place.
.Consequently, the Government indicates that the administrative investigation had not been concluded as a result of a lack of action on the part of the parties concerned and that the Government had had to act officially in order to ensure that the facts came to light and that they could be considered from a legal point of view. In this respect, the Government states that it still does not have sufficient evidence to pronounce on the case as, to date, it only has the evidence on file, which is documentary, and which needs to be compared to the evidence presented by the parties in the denunciation and the reply. Furthermore, the Government notes the Committee s recommendation that the investigation should cover all the allegations made by the complainant in this case, and it confirms that it will apprise the Committee of the outcome.
.With regard to the accuracy of the allegations, the Government states that, in view of the difference in the statements made by the parties and the fact that the proceedings are in the preliminary stages, it is in no position to take any specific measures in this case. Without prejudice to this, the Government repeats that which has already been stated with regard to other complaints laid before the Committee on Freedom of Association against the Government of Uruguay, inasmuch as the reinstatement of a worker who has been dismissed on trade union grounds is not provided for in national legislation and has been expressly rejected by the labour courts. The fact that a worker has been dismissed on such grounds, and that this dismissal is illegal, in accordance with legislation and jurisprudence, leads to the imposition of a fine that may be accompanied by a legal penalty to pay compensation, but it does not provide for specific execution in the form of reinstatement of the worker in the private enterprise.
.Finally, the Government states that the measures used to guarantee respect of collective agreements, in accordance with national legislation, are preventive, dissuasive and punitive: (a) a collective agreement must be registered with the National Directorate of Labour, which endorses its date of establishment and publicizes it; (b) the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security has the authority to impose fines on those enterprises not respecting the agreements, relative to the seriousness of the omissions or violations and the numbers of workers in the enterprise affected by these violations; and (c) a record is established of previous violations and penalties with regard to each enterprise in order to ensure that steeper fines are imposed on those enterprises that continue to violate the collective agreements. These measures take place without prejudice to other types of remedy that may be imposed by the independent legal system and that the Government lack, such as protective measures and proceedings or appeals for protection of constitutional rights (amparo). The Government states that as soon as",1,2000,Uruguay
66,"the investigation is concluded, it will inform the Committee of the outcome and the measures to be taken.
.The Committee recalls that in this present case, the complainant organization had alleged: (i) that the Savings and Loans Cooperative for Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA) denounced the collective agreement in force once it became aware of the intentions of union leaders of the cooperative to become affiliated to the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU); (ii) the dismissal of members of this trade union (Nelson Corbo, Eduardo Cevallos, Gonzalo Ribas, Andrea Oyharbide, Gerardo Olivieri and Marcelo Almadia) and the transfer of another member (Virginia Orrego); and (iii) that workers joining the AEBU were threatened with dismissal. Moreover, the Committee recalls that at its June  meeting, it requested the Government to take steps to ensure that the investigation, which was begun more than one year ago, was concluded quickly, that it covered all the allegations made by the complainant and that if those allegations were found to be true that those workers who had been dismissed or transferred for trade union reasons were reinstated in their positions with payment of back wages and that respect of established collective agreements was fully guaranteed at CAOFA.
.The Committee notes that the Government: () provides details on the different stages of the administrative investigation; () states that the parties to the proceedings showed no interest in this moving forward and that the Government, in June , decided officially to continue to receive testimonial evidence and fixed a hearing for this, which had not yet taken place; () states that the administrative investigation had not been concluded owing to inaction by the parties and that there was a lack of sufficient evidence to pronounce on the case as the only evidence available (documentary evidence) needed to be compared with the testimonial evidence submitted by the parties in the denunciation and reply; () indicates that it has noted the Committee s recommendation that the investigation should cover all the allegations made by the complainant; and () states that regarding the accuracy of the allegations, in view of the difference between the parties' statements and the fact that the proceedings are still in the preliminary stages, it is not in a position to take any measures in this regard.
.In this regard, the Committee regrets that, in spite of two years having passed since the date of the dismissals and the other acts of anti-union discrimination (January ) and two years since the beginning of the administrative investigation (March ), the facts have still not yet been ascertained. In these circumstances, the Committee strongly urges the Government to: () take measures to ensure that the administrative investigation under way is immediately concluded; () ensure that the investigation covers all the allegations made by the complainant in this case; and () transmit information on the results obtained in this respect. Finally, noting that the Government states that reinstatement of those workers dismissed for anti-union reasons is not laid down in national legislation and has been expressly refused by the labour courts when such measures had been requested, the Committee requests the Government that, if it finds that these dismissals and transfers have occurred for anti-union reasons, it apply the sanctions laid down in national legislation, referred to in its reply (a fine and the imposition of a legal penalty to pay special compensation), and that it mediate between the parties in order to obtain the reinstatement of those workers affected. The Committee brings the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to adopt the following recommendations:(a) The Committee urges the Government to: () take measures to ensure that the administrative investigation under way, of which it was informed in June , is immediately concluded; () ensure that the investigation covers all the allegations made by the complainant in this case; and () communicate its observations, based on the information obtained in this respect.(b) The Committee requests the Government, if it finds that the dismissals and transfers in this case have occurred for anti-union reasons, to apply the sanctions laid down in the national legislation, referred to in its reply (a fine and the imposition of a legal penalty to pay special compensation), and to mediate between the parties in order to obtain the reinstatement of those workers affected.(c) The Committee brings the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The complaint in this case is contained in the communication from the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) of June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of June , the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) alleges that members of the provisional trade union committee of workers of the Savings and Loans Cooperative of Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA) were dismissed for having attempted to form an enterprise union, affiliated to the AEBU. The AEBU states that an enterprise union previously existed called the Association of CAOFA Officials (AFUCA), which had signed a collective labour agreement with the enterprise that is still in force, which the enterprise maintains that it has denounced. According to the complainant, in January , the leaders of AFUCA, Nelson Corbo and Eduardo Cevallos, along with other workers, proposed that this trade union become a member of the AEBU. When the enterprise became aware of the intentions of its unionized workers, it refused to recognize the enterprise union and the collective labour agreement in force. Furthermore, in a memo issued to staff dated  December , the enterprise denounced the agreement and took over the payment of contributions being deducted from various workers to pay off loans made against salaries granted by the Banking Retirement and Pension Fund.
.The complainant states that for the above reasons, and since CAOFA workers were already affiliated to the AEBU, it requested a meeting with the management of the enterprise, but the latter did not permit its workers to attend, claiming that it did not recognize their membership of the banking union. Faced with this situation, the AEBU appealed to the National Directorate of Labour (DINATRA) to summon the enterprise in order to deal with issues that could not be discussed owing to its refusal to recognize that its workers were members of the AEBU delegation, and to address this latter issue, which undoubtedly entailed acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The AEBU alleges that on  January , only two days before the meeting with the AEBU delegation, Mr. Nelson Corbo, head of the AEBU provisional committee at CAOFA, was dismissed in another obvious act of anti-union discrimination. On  January , a hearing was held at the National Directorate of Labour; however the enterprise did not attend. On  January , a new hearing was held at DINATRA and was attended by the enterprise, which denied that Mr. Nelson Corbo had been dismissed on trade union grounds, alleging that the AEBU had at no time communicated a list of CAOFA workers affiliated to the banking union. This hearing was attended by the AEBU delegation, CAOFA workers affiliated to the AEBU, namely Nelson Corbo (dismissed days earlier), Eduardo Cevallos, Gonzalo Ribas, Andrea Oyharbide, Gerardo Olivieri and Marcelo Almada. This hearing took place at around midday and later that afternoon all members of the AEBU delegation employed at CAOFA were dismissed.
.The complainant adds that the enterprise subsequently threatened all workers that anyone who confirmed in writing their intention to remain affiliated to the AEBU, in order to have union contributions deducted from their salaries, would be dismissed just like the other workers who had been members of the provisional committee. According to the AEBU, this pressure was successful, given that only three workers confirmed their affiliation to the AEBU: Sandra Suarez, Carina Sanzone and Virginia Orrego. With regard to Ms. Virginia Orrego, it should be noted that on  February  she was transferred from the board secretariat to a position involving serving the public, and was forced to take her regulatory annual leave, which she is currently doing.
.Finally, the complainant states that the enterprise cannot claim that the dismissals were due to redundancies or service requirements, given that the dismissed workers were subsequently replaced with newly employed staff.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that upon the request of AEBU members, the Collective Bargaining Department of the National Directorate of Labour summoned CAOFA to a hearing on  January  to resolve three difficult situations, which are clearly described in the official record produced by the abovementioned department. By virtue of the content of this official record, the aim of the",1,2000,Uruguay
67,"meeting was to bring the parties together to resolve the following issues: (a) the irregular deductions from the salaries of officials, to make loan payments into the Bank Fund, which were not paid by the enterprise, thus leaving employees behind with their payments; (b) the irregular denouncement of the collective agreement; and (c) the non-payment of the extra bonus established in this agreement. The Government states that it was also informed by the trade union delegation that Mr. Nelson Corbo, who had participated in the trade union negotiations, was dismissed by the enterprise on  January , and it was assumed that the same measure would be adopted for Mr. Eduardo Cevallos. The enterprise did not appear at this hearing and a new hearing was called for  January .
.On  January , both parties attended and each of the issues which had led to the conflict was assessed. The enterprise acknowledged that it owed the abovementioned items and committed itself to paying them as soon as possible. Similarly, the enterprise maintained that the amounts that had been deducted and not paid into the Bank Fund would be included in a payment agreement to be signed immediately. With respect to Mr. Nelson Corbo, the enterprise alleged that he was dismissed based on his performance (not being efficient in his job) and not on trade union grounds, and refused to recognize that its staff were members of the AEBU. The position adopted by each sector is recorded in the minutes, and the Department of Collective Bargaining of the National Directorate of Labour has not been involved in the conflict since, as its intervention has not been requested.
.The Government adds that on  March , it lodged a complaint against CAOFA before the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security on behalf of the AEBU and the provisional trade union committee of CAOFA, for alleged acts of anti-union discrimination, which initiated the administrative proceedings aimed at determining whether or not the conduct of the enterprise constituted a violation. To date, a final resolution has not been adopted on the denounced acts and evidence is still being processed. According to the Government, the abovementioned administrative proceedings have followed the due procedure, in that, notwithstanding the evidence officially gathered through procedural investigations, the parties involved have also had the possibility of submitting evidence and sustaining their case. Finally, the Government indicates that once proceedings are finalized, it will communicate the results and the adopted measures to the Committee.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant alleges that once the Savings and Loans Cooperative for Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA) became aware of the intentions of union leaders of the cooperative to become affiliated to the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU), CAOFA refused to recognize the enterprise union, denounced the collective agreement that was in force, dismissed six workers affiliated to the AEBU (Nelson Corbo, on  January , and Eduardo Cevallos, Gonzalo Ribas, Andrea Oyharbide, Gerardo Olivieri and Marcelo Almada on  January ), transferred another worker (Virginia Orrego), and, finally, threatened workers that anyone who confirmed in writing their intention to remain affiliated to the AEBU would be dismissed just like the other workers who had been members of the AEBU provisional committee.
.With regard to these allegations, the Committee takes note that the Government states that: (i) the National Directorate of Labour summoned the parties to a hearing on  January  to bring the parties together and resolve issues relating to irregular deductions from the salaries of officials to make loan payments into the Bank Fund, the irregular denouncement of the collective agreement, the non-payment of the extra bonus established in this agreement, and the dismissal of Mr. Nelson Corbo, who had participated in trade union negotiations; (ii) since the enterprise did not appear at the hearing on  January , another hearing was called for  January  during which the enterprise acknowledged that it owed the abovementioned items and committed itself to paying them as soon as possible, and stated that Mr. Nelson Corbo had been dismissed for not being efficient in his job and not on trade union grounds; (iii) the Department of Collective Bargaining of the National Directorate of Labour has not been involved in the conflict since, as its intervention has not been requested; and (iv) on  March , the AEBU lodged a complaint against CAOFA before the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security for alleged acts of anti-union discrimination, which initiated an administrative investigation which is at the stage of processing evidence.
.In this respect, the Committee regrets that the Government has not communicated its observations on the dismissal of several workers affiliated to the AEBU and the transfer of another worker, as well as on the threats of dismissal made to any workers who affiliated themselves with the AEBU. The Committee notes with concern that according to the complainant, Eduardo Cevallos, Gonzalo Ribas, Andrea Oyharbide, Gerardo Olivieri and Marcelo Almada were dismissed on the same day ( January ) they attended the hearing representing the AEBU trade union organization alongside the enterprise in order to discuss various difficult issues, and that Ms. Virginia Orrego was transferred after having informed the enterprise that she wanted trade union contributions to be deducted from her salary and paid to the AEBU. The Committee recalls that  No person shall be prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present' and that  Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination should cover not only hiring and dismissal, but also any discriminatory measures during employment, in particular transfers, downgrading and other acts that are prejudicial to the worker' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ].
.In these circumstances, noting that the Government states that an administrative investigation is under way initiated following a complaint lodged by the AEBU against CAOFA for anti-union acts, the Committee requests the Government to: () take measures so that this investigation, started more than one year ago, is quickly concluded; () ensure that the investigation covers all the allegations made by the complainant in this case; and () take measures, if during this investigation the allegations are found to be true, so that: (i) workers dismissed on trade union grounds or transferred are reinstated immediately in their jobs, with the payment of back wages; and (ii) in the future, the respect of established collective agreements is fully guaranteed at CAOFA as well as that of legal provisions against acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to transmit information on the results of the investigation and any measures adopted.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to adopt the following recommendation:Noting that the Government states that an administrative investigation is under way, initiated following a complaint lodged by the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) against the Savings and Loans Cooperative of Officials of the Armed Forces (CAOFA) for anti-union acts, the Committee requests the Government to:(a) take measures so that this investigation, started more than one year ago, is quickly concluded;(b) ensure that the investigation covers all the allegations made by the complainant in this case;(c) take measures, if during this investigation the allegations are found to be true, so that: (i) workers dismissed on trade union grounds or transferred are reinstated immediately in their jobs, with the payment of back wages; and (ii) in the future, the respect of established collective agreements is fully guaranteed at CAOFA as well as that of legal provisions against acts of anti-union discrimination; and(d) transmit information on the results of the investigation and any measures adopted.",1,2000,Uruguay
68,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Inter-Trade Union Assembly - Workers' National Convention (PIT-CNT) dated  June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the PIT-CNT explains that the company Gaseba Uruguay S.A. (of the Gas de France group) is a private company which has a public service licence to distribute mains gas. In March , the Autonomous Union of Gas Workers and Employees (UAOEGAS), which represents employees of Gaseba Uruguay S.A., felt obliged to inform workers, government bodies and the general public that Gaseba Uruguay S.A. had begun using a substance known as amerzine in its industrial processes. The effects of that substance on workers' health were reported as well as appropriate preventive and safety procedures to be followed by persons handling it, but the company refused to implement them. The union's allegations were corroborated by the Labour Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security when it inspected the site on  May . The inspection confirmed the use of amerzine, its toxicity and the failure to apply essential safety measures (a copy of the inspection report is attached). As a result of this, the Labour Inspectorate banned Gaseba Uruguay S.A. from using amerzine and gave the company ten days to put a new procedure in place.
.The PIT-CNT adds that Gaseba Uruguay S.A. reported union officials and activists who had obtained samples of the substance for the criminal justice authorities. The latter, by agreement with the Ministry of Public Affairs, ruled that no crime had been committed by the workers (the complainant supplies a copy of the ruling). On  March , having failed to intimidate the trade unionists by reporting them to the criminal justice authorities, the company announced the dismissal of the following trade unionists who had been actively involved in reporting the company's use of amerzine: Pablo Fernndez, Wilson Sequeira, Walter Surez Pi and Alejandro Acosta.
.The PIT-CNT also alleges that on  December  the company announced the dismissal of another  workers. All of them were union members and four of them were members of the union's executive committee. A number of these workers decided to accept compensation in return for leaving the company, while others did not. The employees who refused compensation included the following union officials: Luis Puig, who is currently President of UAOEGAS; Washington Beltrn, the union's General Secretary; and Angel Garca, a member of the union's executive committee since  and former section delegate.
.Bearing in mind the needs of the population and given that an interruption in service when the gas mains network is obsolete and poorly maintained might have serious consequences, the union decided to pursue forceful measures while stopping short of strike action and to accept the mediation of the Ministry of Labour. Thus, in the course of a long consultation procedure in which the Ministry of Labour was actively involved, several of the dismissed workers decided to accept the solution proposed by the Ministry, which was to leave the company in return for compensation.
.As regards the workers who had suffered anti-union dismissal and did not accept financial compensation, two agreements were concluded with the assistance of the Ministry of Labour. The first, which was concluded on  May  (the complainant supplies a copy), concerns the first group of workers dismissed. This agreement invalidated the illegal dismissals announced by the company on  March  and in their place imposed a three-year suspension of the employment contract of each of the four employees concerned (Mr. Fernndez, Mr. Sequeira, Mr. Surez Pi and Mr. Acosta), all of whom were union officials. The agreement also stipulated that during the period of the suspension, the workers would continue to receive their wages but would be required to refrain from any activity in the company. Furthermore, the workers whose contracts were suspended undertook not to represent the union in its relations with the company during the suspension period. The union accepted these restrictions on the understanding that the anti-union dismissals were null and void and could be rectified only by the reinstatement of the dismissed workers.
.The second agreement was concluded on  March , also with the participation of the Ministry of Labour. It concerns the workers whose dismissal was announced on  December  (the complainant supplies a copy of the relevant document). Under the terms of this agreement, some of the workers accepted compensation; another group was reinstated; a third group registered for unemployment benefits, without terminating their contracts of employment with the company. Certain points of the agreement have yet to be implemented, since the period for which the workers were put on unemployment benefits has not yet expired.
.The PIT-CNT indicates that on  May , the day on which the period of suspension of Pablo Fernndez, Wilson Sequeira, Walter Surez Pi and Alejandro Acosta expired, Gaseba Uruguay S.A. informed each of them that they were dismissed for flagrant misconduct, thus reverting to its practice of anti-union dismissals. The anti-union nature of the dismissals is clear from the following facts:-- all the workers dismissed are trade union officials;-- in March  they had been actively involved in reporting the company for using dangerous substances without applying the necessary safety measures;-- they had already been dismissed for anti-union reasons by the company which had agreed to take them back after a three year suspension; and-- the grounds given for the dismissals, namely flagrant misconduct (which is required for dismissal under Uruguayan law) is absurd when one considers that the workers in question had kept away from their places of work for three years.
.The PIT-CNT emphasizes that, when these facts were brought to the attention of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the latter made no move to order the reinstatement of the dismissed union members, nor did it attempt to prevent the illegal dismissals being carried out; this constitutes non-compliance with Convention No. . The Government's attitude of refusing to order reinstatement in cases of anti-union dismissals and favouring agreements under which workers who have been the victims of anti-union dismissal are paid compensation is publicly acknowledged by government spokespersons and well known to employers, and is becoming counter-productive. A bad employer inclined to acts of anti-union discrimination, when calculating costs and benefits, will regard compensation and fines, even large ones, as a relatively insignificant ""cost"" by comparison with the ""benefits"" of bringing about the destruction of a trade union organization.
.In its communication dated  November , the Government indicates that the allegations of the PIT-CNT in essence relate to a presumed failure on the part of the Government to meet its obligation to provide protection against violations of freedom of association in the form of the dismissals of two separate groups of workers employed by Gaseba Uruguay S.A, in that the company announced the dismissal of four employees on one occasion (Pablo Fernndez, Wilson Sequeira, Walter Surez Pi and Alejandro Acosta) and dismissed three others (Luis Puig, Washington Beltrn and Angel Garca) on a subsequent occasion. These dismissals occurred within a period of three years and, in the Government's view, did not call for sanctions against Gaseba Uruguay S.A. on grounds of violation of freedom of association.
.The Government indicates that, according to the company, Pablo Fernndez, Wilson Sequeira, Walter Surez Pi and Alejandro Acosta had been dismissed as a result of acts which it described as ""flagrant misconduct"". These dismissals were subsequently suspended by an agreement of  May  under the terms of which the company would continue to pay the workers' wages and other benefits for a period of three years, while the workers would be prevented from working in the company and from entering premises owned or used by the company during that period. The company provided the judicial authorities with an account of the actions of the four workers which led to the decision to dismiss them on grounds of ""flagrant misconduct"": it is especially important to bear in mind here that under Uruguayan law, criminal law is not binding on labour law or vice versa. The Government indicates that when the three-year period specified in the agreement of  May  elapsed, Gaseba Uruguay S.A. confirmed its previous decision to dismiss these four workers who, it is claimed, had assaulted security staff when removing photos and property from company premises. It is important to note in this regard that employees of Gaseba Uruguay S.A. or of any other company who have any concerns concerning the type and characteristics of products used by the employer or concerning the state of facilities may report them anonymously to the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate, an executive body of directorate status subordinate to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Legislation gives inspectors the power ""to enter by day or",0,1999,Uruguay
69,"night any premises on which workers are employed; ... to take or remove for the purpose of analysis samples of materials and substances used or handled at the establishment and subject to expert technical examination, on condition that the employer or his representative are notified of any samples or substances taken or removed for such purposes"". Act No.  of  November  provides for sanctions for non-compliance with labour laws and regulations in the form of warnings, fines (equivalent to between  and  times the daily wages of the workers affected by the offence) or closure of the establishment for up to six days with full continued payment of wages (section ). These sanctions are applicable without delay and, in the case of a fine, it is possible, as an exception to the general principle of banking confidentiality, to block the employer's bank accounts in consultation with the country's central bank, the Banco Central de Uruguay (section ).
.Consequently, there is no legal lacuna which could justify independent action by the workers and there is no evidence that the employees concerned have ever denied the company's allegations. Since there has been no ruling by the administrative authorities or the courts dismissing the accusations of ""flagrant misconduct"", the Government, through its labour administration system, has not deemed it appropriate to impose sanctions for violation of freedom of association.
.As regards the dismissals of Luis Puig, Washington Beltrn and Angel Garca, the Government states that on  December , Gaseba Uruguay S.A. announced the dismissal of  employees on the grounds of operational and administrative restructuring. This led to a dispute between the trade union and the company in which the Ministry of Labour and Social Security acted as mediator and secured an agreement between the parties on  March  (a copy has been supplied by the Government). The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, acting de oficio, also conducted an inquiry into possible anti-union motives for the dismissals. At the hearing on  July , the agreement with which the parties had ended the dispute was taken into consideration as evidence. This agreement involved the reinstatement of four union representatives including the union president Mr. Miguel Vela and a -month suspension of the contracts of employment of the remaining  employees, who registered for unemployment benefits; the company undertook to rehire  of them at the end of the suspension period and to pay compensation to the three who were not rehired. The Ministry of Labour inquiry into the possible existence of anti-union practices by Gaseba Uruguay S.A. resulted in a ruling of  July  that the anti-union character of the dismissals of  December  was not proven and that the legal proceedings should be stopped (the Government attaches a copy of the ruling). This conclusion would appear to be supported by the joint statement by the company and the union in point  of the agreement of  March : ""The parties confirm the applicability of Conventions Nos. ,  and , without prejudice to the fulfilment of any obligations under the terms of the contracts of employment."" This means that the parties, in ending the dispute which led to the agreement under which three workers would not be rehired, understood that there was no failure to comply with international Conventions Nos. ,  and . Fifteen months later, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security considered the matter and came to the same conclusion as the parties themselves, namely that there had been no infringement of international labour standards. The Government states that the fact that Gaseba Uruguay S.A. would not rehire three of the workers at the end of the three-year suspension period had been accepted by the company trade union UAOEGAS and the PIT-CNT, a fact which is clear from the agreement of  March .
.In summary, the Government states that in the case of the first four dismissals on grounds of flagrant misconduct, it is clear that it was not the intention of the parties in the agreement of  May  to specify what would happen after three years, and the company's final decision to dismiss the workers is consistent with its initial position. The labour administration has means of enforcing compliance with health and safety laws and regulations and the workers' independent action is therefore not acceptable. Nor is there any record of the workers concerned denying the company's allegations; consequently the labour administration authorities cannot adopt a position which might be at variance with that of the labour courts. The three dismissals which occurred at the end of the -month period specified in the agreement of  March  were obviously not based on anti-union discrimination by the company, since they were allowed under the terms of the very document in which the parties acknowledge the applicability of ILO Conventions Nos. ,  and . The Government therefore requests that the complainant's allegations be dismissed.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant alleges anti-union dismissal of seven trade union officials by the company Gaseba Uruguay S.A. As regards the dismissal of the trade union officials Pablo Fernndez, Wilson Sequeira, Walter Surez Pi and Alejandro Acosta, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant, they were dismissed on grounds of ""flagrant misconduct"", although the real motive was their active involvement in bringing to public notice the fact that Gaseba Uruguay S.A. has begun using the hazardous substance amerzine in its processes; the criminal justice authorities, in agreement with the Ministry of Public Affairs, stated that no offence had been committed by the workers concerned. The Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that the ""flagrant misconduct"" involved assaults by the four union officials in question against security staff when they had taken photos and property from company premises (these allegations are not denied by the workers concerned) and that, given that the officials could have applied to the labour inspection authorities and invoked existing regulations which provide for sanctions in the event of failure to comply with health and safety regulations in the form of warnings, fines or closure with maintenance of workers' wages, there was no legal lacuna which could justify autonomous action by the union officials. The Committee also notes that according to the agreement of  May , the parties agreed that the dismissal of the four union officials should be suspended and that the company should continue to pay their wages and other benefits for a period of three years during which time they would be barred from working in the company or entering company premises. The Government states that on that occasion it was not the intention of the parties to specify what should happen at the end of the three-year period and that the company's final decision in favour of dismissal when that period elapsed is consistent with its original position.
.The Committee notes that the agreement of  May  contains the following provisions:-- The contracts of employment of Pablo Fernndez, Wilson Sequeira, Walter Surez Pi and Alejandro Acosta are suspended for a period of three years, as of the present date (of the agreement).-- As a result of the aforementioned suspension, the employees in question are forbidden to perform any task or carry out any function in the company, whilst the company will nevertheless pay the wages and other benefits owed to the employees. Payment will be made in the Ministry of Labour before the fifth working day of each month.-- Messrs. Pablo Fernndez, Wilson Sequeira, Walter Surez Pi and Alejandro Acosta are not allowed to enter company premises or any site where the company carries on operations. To that end and during the period of the suspension, the PIT-CNT and UAOEGAS are responsible for ensuring that these officials will not take part in any measures implemented by the trade union with the company Gaseba Uruguay S.A., under any circumstances.-- The parties agree to establish talks immediately with a view to reaching a collective agreement on wages and other conditions.-- UAOEGAS undertakes to suspend all the union's actions currently under way.-- If any of the parties fails to fulfil the obligations accepted under the terms of the present agreement, with the exception of payment of wages and other benefits, the agreement shall automatically be null and void.The Committee concludes that the agreement of  May  says nothing about what was to happen at the end of the three-year (paid) suspension of the officials' contracts of employment. However, the Committee shares the view of the Government that the trade union and the four officials in question could and should have informed the labour inspection authorities of the presence of the hazardous substance amerzine so that it could take appropriate protective measures, rather than taking the law into their own hands by assaulting security staff when removing photos and company property from company premises, an action which went beyond the legitimate exercise of trade union rights. Nevertheless, bearing in mind that the",-1,1999,Uruguay
70,"aim of the officials' actions was to protect the health of staff, the Committee takes the view that, while these actions could have justified disciplinary sanctions, it could not justify the most serious sanction of dismissal, given that there were extenuating circumstances and the agreement between the parties could be interpreted as ruling out any subsequent confirmation of the dismissals. Under these circumstances, taking into account the particular circumstances of the case, the Committee urges the Government to take measures to bring the parties together with a view to finding a solution for the situation of the four union officials which will be satisfactory to both parties..As regards the dismissals of Luis Puig, Washington Beltrn and Angel Garca, who were dismissed on  December  together with  other workers, the Committee notes that according to the complainant, the parties signed an agreement on  March  in which the Ministry of Labour was also involved; according to that agreement, a number of the dismissed workers have accepted their situation in return for compensation, others have been reinstated and a third group (including the three officials referred to here) refuses to accept compensation and is registered for unemployment benefits without terminating their contracts of employment. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the Ministry of Labour's inquiry has not shown that the dismissals of the three trade union officials were based on anti-union discrimination and that the company's decision at the end of the -month period (of unemployment benefits) not to rehire the three workers in question had already been accepted by the trade union UAOEGAS, a fact that is made clear by the agreement of  March , according to which: ""The parties confirm the applicability of Conventions Nos. ,  and , without prejudice to the implementation of any obligations under the terms of the contracts of employment."" In the investigation undertaken by the Ministry of Labour, the company pointed out that: () financial problems made it necessary to carry out restructuring and staff cuts, and the subsequent decision to dismiss  employees was taken for purely economic reasons; () most of the employees affected were not trade union officials, only four holding union posts; () the company based its decision as to which employees should be laid off on employees' particulars and seniority. The agreement of  March  indicate that the dispute ended with the reinstatement of most of the workers, including the president of UAOEGAS. With regard to the three union officials and the other group of dismissed workers, point  of the agreement states that:The remaining workers affected by the decision of  December  will be registered for unemployment benefits, during which time they will receive from the National Employment Board and/or other competent public bodies appropriate retraining. On expiry of the period of entitlement to unemployment benefits and any extensions thereof requested by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the company undertakes to reinstate  persons of its choosing, unless that number have left the company voluntarily, in which case there shall be no obligation of reinstatement. The total number of reinstatements or voluntary redundancies shall not exceed . The rest shall be assessed by a tripartite commission set up for that purpose and consisting of a representative of the workers, a representative of the company and the National Director of Labour or his designated representative ... If the tripartite commission decides against the workers, the employment of the latter shall be terminated and they shall receive compensation equivalent to two-and-a-half times the statutory amount. If the commission decides in their favour, and they have not in the meantime been reinstated by the company, these workers shall be entitled to special leave unless they have entered into a new employment relationship with a third party, and shall during that leave, for a period of up to twelve months, be paid the full wages which they would have received had they been working. Payment for the period of leave shall be effected in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the company shall deposit the necessary money for that purpose. At the end of the leave period, if the company has not rehired the workers in question, their employment shall be terminated and they shall be entitled to compensation for dismissal equivalent to double the amount specified in point . Once the assessment has been made, and provided that it is favourable, the tripartite commission shall meet after another six months and at that time shall review the assessment, which, if favourable, shall give rise to a continuation of the special leave. If on the other hand it is not favourable, the employment of the workers in question shall be terminated and they shall be paid the compensation provided for in point ..Under these circumstances, the Committee concludes that there is not sufficient evidence to state with certainty that the dismissal of the trade union officials is linked to their trade union functions or activities, given that they took place under the terms of the agreement of  March .
.As regards the dismissals of Luis Puig, Washington Beltrn and Angel Garca, who were dismissed on  December  together with  other workers, the Committee notes that according to the complainant, the parties signed an agreement on  March  in which the Ministry of Labour was also involved; according to that agreement, a number of the dismissed workers have accepted their situation in return for compensation, others have been reinstated and a third group (including the three officials referred to here) refuses to accept compensation and is registered for unemployment benefits without terminating their contracts of employment.

.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to take steps to bring the parties together with a view to finding a solution to the situation of the trade union officials Pablo Fernndez, Wilson Sequeira, Walter Surez Pi and Alejandro Acosta which is satisfactory to both parties.",1,1999,Uruguay
72,".The Committee examined this case relating to anti-union measures and sanctions against trade union officials and workers at the CONAPROLE enterprise at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the inquiry carried out by the Labour Inspectorate into the alleged restrictions on the access of trade union officials to the workplace.
.In a communication dated  August , the Association of Workers and Employees of CONAPROLE (AOEC) states that the situation of the trade union leader Ramn Vitalis remains unchanged and that the commission that is to re-examine his case has still not been convened (the trade union leader had been dismissed and the Government informed the Committee that his conduct at work would be analysed by a commission made up of representatives from the National Labour Directorate and the Trade Union Confederation PIT-CNT).
.In its communication dated  December , the Government states that the issue of Ramn Vitalis was definitively resolved both at the national level, and with regard to its examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association it had been duly and repeatedly shown that his separation from the enterprise was for work related reasons which in no way constituted a case of trade union repression. This has been the conclusion not only of the administrative procedure carried out before the General Labour Inspectorate, but also of the pronouncements of the labour courts, in both first and second instance. The two rulings agreed that the worker had committed what both doctrine and national case law deem  flagrant bad conduct' and as such he is not entitled to claim abusive dismissal, while any notion of a violation of freedom of association by the enterprise is fully ruled out. The Government adds that without prejudice to the conflict that gave rise to this case (which goes back to ), it is clear that labour relations at the enterprise have gone back to normal, as evidenced by the note sent to the ILO by the Association of Workers and Employees of CONAPROLE dated  August , so that far from indicating new grounds for conflict it is persisting with the case of Ramn Vitalis, whose work situation has been clearly and definitively resolved from both the administrative and jurisdictional points of view. Lastly, the Government states that relations are fluid between the enterprise and the trade union and mentions the various agreements reached between  and  (the most recent of them in September  concerning wages).
.The Committee notes this information and in particular that the judicial authority concluded in respect of the dismissal of the trade union leader Mr. Vitalis, that  no causal link was found between the dismissal and the trade union role of the person in question (Mr. Vitalis) ... whereas there is ample proof of the bad conduct cited by the complainant (CONAPROLE enterprise)'  Nevertheless, the Committee regrets to observe that the Government has provided no information about the result of the inquiry carried out by the Labour Inspectorate into the alleged restrictions on access of trade union officials to the workplace. Whatever the case may be, the Committee trusts that in the framework of the normalization of labour relations between the enterprise and the AOEC trade union announced by the Government, this matter has been resolved and requests the Government to ensure that this is the case.
.The Committee last examined this case, relating to anti-union measures during collective bargaining and disciplinary measures against trade union officials and workers, at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On this occasion, the Committee requested the Government to ensure that the disciplinary measures against the three trade union officials for holding information meetings at Plant No.  in Canelones were immediately revoked, that the trade union officials were allowed reasonable access to the workplace and, in their abovementioned capacity, to effectively carry out their mandate unhindered to further and defend the interests of workers, and that the workers of CONAPROLE were allowed freely to express their opinions, without fear of intimidation or risk of reprisal by their employers.
.In its communication of  August , the Government indicates that the complainant organization did not provide the identities of the trade union officials who had been subjected to disciplinary measures for holding information meetings, that the right to hold information meetings in the enterprise is linked to these taking place during rest periods and that Convention No.  refers to participation in union activities, with the consent of the employers, within working hours. With regard to those allegations relating to restrictions on the right to reasonable access to the workplace for trade union officials in the plants, the Labour Inspectorate will be carrying out inquiries. Finally, with regard to intimidation of employees who freely express their opinions, the Government indicates that it is unaware of the veracity of the alleged acts and that it will refrain from pronouncing on the situation until the parties have presented their cases.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the inquiry carried out by the Labour Inspectorate into the alleged restrictions on trade union officials in their access to the workplace.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras. -].
.The Government had sent observations in communications dated  December  and  January ; however, as these did not cover all the allegations, the Committee was forced to postpone its examination of this case until its meeting in May/June . The Government sent further observations in a communication dated  September .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the pending allegations from the previous examination of the case centre around the fact that three trade union officials were disciplined following information meetings; that CONAPROLE representatives indicated that any claims by workers, even through the labour courts, would result in a loss of trust in the worker concerned or would be regarded as an act of bad faith, while meetings were prohibited and trade union officials were barred from entering places of work, breaking with the established custom of more than  years.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government did not send any observations, and confined itself to indicating that the CONAPROLE enterprise was currently in the process of constructive dialogue in which the adoption of specific agreements between the parties to encourage efforts for ""decent work"" was proposed (the Government attached photocopies of the various agreements and contracts signed by the company and the employees to that effect).
.In this respect, the Committee emphasizes the right of occupational organizations to hold meetings in their premises to discuss occupational questions, without prior authorization and interference by the authorities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee highlights that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures, and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.As the Government did not submit observations, the Committee requests it to ensure that the disciplinary measures against the three trade union officials for holding information meetings are immediately revoked, and that trade union officials are allowed reasonable access to the workplace so that they may, in their abovementioned capacity, effectively fulfil their mandate unhindered to further and defend the interests of workers [see Article  of Convention No. ].
.As regards the freedom of workers of CONAPROLE to express their dissatisfaction, without being intimidated or subject to reprisals by their employer, the Committee emphasizes that the full exercise of trade union rights calls for a free flow of information, opinions and ideas, and that to this end workers, employers and their organizations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression at their meetings, in their publications and in the course of other trade union activities [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Finally, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the steps taken to comply with the abovementioned rights, in the light of the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the disciplinary measures against the three trade union officials for holding information meetings are immediately",1,1999,Uruguay
73,"revoked, that the trade union officials are allowed reasonable access to the workplace and, in their abovementioned capacity, to effectively carry out their mandate unhindered to further and defend the interests of workers, and that the workers of CONAPROLE are allowed freely to express their opinions, without fear of intimidation or risk of reprisal by their employers. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the steps taken to carry out this recommendation.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  January  from the Association of Workers and Employees of CONAPROLE (AOEC). The Government replied in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January , the Association of Workers and Employees of CONAPROLE (AOEC) explains that the National Cooperative of Milk Producers (CONAPROLE) is the county's most important dairy company, employing some , workers,  per cent of whom are AOEC members.
.According to the AOEC, the union in September, October and November  initiated a number of actions following months of unsuccessful talks aimed at achieving a new collective agreement. The measures included half-hour stoppages, some -hour stoppages, etc. In the view of the complainant, the company's actions in response violated the principle of freedom of association and ILO Conventions Nos.  and . Specifically, the AOEC alleges that CONAPROLE:-- broke with the practice of almost  years by deciding on  October  to stop deductions from wages of workers' union membership dues; this situation was resolved in November once the relevant bipartite or tripartite bodies under the Ministry of Labour had been established;-- when wages were paid for October , the company docked pay for more hours than had actually been spent in stoppages. This affected  workers and was tantamount to a sanction for exercising the right to strike;-- between  and  October , as a result of the union's actions, new sanctions were imposed; warnings concerning low output were issued to  workers (at the Tarariras plant),  workers were disciplined for a period of between one and three days, tasks were not assigned to a number of workers at the Tarariras plant, including the trade union official Mr. Ramn Vitalis, and an indirect dismissal procedure was started;-- on  November , CONAPROLE made a report to the police which resulted in an intimidating police presence at Plant No.  in Montevideo and Plant No.  in Tarariras;-- sanctions were applied to workers who did not work as a result of the union actions;-- work normally done by workers involved in the union's actions was contracted out to other companies;-- on  November , the trade union officials Mr. Ramn Vitalis and Mr. Carlos Allegranza were suspended from their posts at CONAPROLE, despite the fact that they had clean disciplinary records.
.The complainant adds that an agreement between CONAPROLE and the trade union contained provisions on disciplinary procedures specifying that CONAPROLE should make available to any worker accused of an offence all the relevant records in order to allow him or her to prepare a defence. An agreement was also signed on  November  to reinstate Carlos Allegranza at a plant other than the one where he normally worked, and the company also undertook within a period of  days to ""consider"" his reinstatement at his normal place of work before being suspended (this has not happened). Ramn Vitalis, on the other hand, would remain suspended for a maximum period of  days on full pay and a bipartite commission would be formed comprising representatives of the Ministry of Labour and the PIT-CNT, the central trade union organization in Uruguay, for the purpose of reviewing the conduct of Mr. Vitalis, on the understanding that the commission's conclusions would be considered by the company when it took a final decision on the matter. However, when the AOEC requested that Mr. Vitalis and Mr. Allegranza be given access to the complete file, the board of the company decided to allow only partial access by submitting only two pages of conclusions and refusing to divulge the names of the persons who had accused them of improper conduct. The company justifies this on the grounds that the persons in question were trusted witnesses of CONAPROLE, supervisors and specially selected officials. The bipartite commission (on which the Ministry of Labour was also represented) ended its deliberations on  December  and stated that Mr. Vitalis must be given access to all the relevant records in order to enjoy all the appropriate safeguards. On  January , Mr. Vitalis was summoned by the company management and told that only the conclusions of the proceedings would be made available to him. Faced with such a situation, Mr. Vitalis took legal advice and chose to reject the proceedings as being totally invalidated by these gross irregularities, in the light of the agreement that had been reached. He was also on this occasion offered the opportunity to ""agree to terms for severance"" and warned that more drastic measures would be taken if an agreement was not reached. On  January , the AOEC was informed by telephone - unofficially - that Mr. Vitalis had been dismissed for ""flagrant misconduct"". Information meetings were then held at a number of places of work, in accordance with standard procedures in use for over  years. They included Plant No.  in Canelones. As a result of these meetings, the three members of the union's executive committee were disciplined.
.Lastly, the complainant indicates that once the dispute was settled, the management of CONAPROLE had stated that any claims on the part of workers, even through the labour courts, would result in a loss of trust in the workers concerned or be regarded as an act of bad faith. Meetings are prohibited and trade union officials have been barred from entering workplaces, breaking with the established practice of more than  years.
.In its communication of  December , the Government states that on  October  the General Labour and Social Security Inspectorate received a report from the Association of Workers and Employees of CONAPROLE (AOEC) relating in essence to two main points: () an anti-union act in the form of the decision of  October  by CONAPROLE management to cancel deductions from wages of union membership dues and other payments that had been made for members of the AOEC; () the fact that the company disciplined several workers for implementing measures decided by the union.
.Regarding the first point, the General Labour Inspectorate had issued a warning to CONAPROLE on  November  (a copy is supplied) for its decision in October  to stop deductions of union membership dues, an action which had caused a dispute and led to collective talks in the Ministry of Labour (the complainant indicates that this situation was resolved in November ).
.As regards the second point (disciplinary measures following trade union actions), the National Labour Directorate's Collective Bargaining Division indicates that negotiations between the company CONAPROLE and its employees began in September  and a collective agreement was signed on  November  (a copy is supplied by the Government).
.The Government indicates that, while it is true that cases of disciplinary measures against workers for their participation in union actions were discussed during the collective talks, all the AOEC's reports of such incidents were made verbally and without indicating the names of the workers affected. These cases were dealt with in the collective agreement. The Government also supplies a copy of the acknowledgment of the collective agreement in which the parties set out their respective positions.
.The collective agreement of  November  includes provisions guaranteeing payment of average wages for the period in question and allowing extension of the agreement for up to three years, by agreement of the parties. The agreement also provides that the ""disciplinary measures adopted by CONAPROLE during the dispute, which in the view of the union were motivated by the union's actions, expire after thirty days and will not be recorded in the files of any of the workers concerned"". As regards the situations of Mr. Allegranza and Mr. Vitalis, the parties agree that ""(a) The company board agrees to reinstate Mr. Carlos Allegranza on  November  at another plant and within  days to consider reinstating him at his original place of work; (b) Mr. Ramn Vitalis will remain suspended for a maximum period of  days, during which time his conduct will be reviewed by a commission consisting of members of the National Labour Directorate and the PIT-CNT. The commission will be empowered to summon representatives of the company and the union in order to hear their views. It will also be empowered to hear the parties concerned if they request it. The commission's conclusions will not be binding but will be taken into consideration by the company board",0,1999,Uruguay
74,"as an additional element when taking a final decision"".
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant has alleged a series of anti-union measures (suspension of deductions from wages of union membership dues, greater wage deductions than were justified by actual hours of stoppages, suspension of trade union officials from their posts, police intervention at places of work, etc.) which were motivated by the actions taken by the AOEC during a collective dispute at the company CONAPROLE in September  following several months of unsuccessful talks aimed at concluding a new collective agreement. The complainant has also alleged that () three trade union officials were disciplined following information meetings and () company representatives have indicated that any claims made by workers - even in labour courts - will result in a loss of trust in the workers concerned or will be regarded as an act of bad faith, meetings are prohibited and trade union officials are barred from entering places of work, breaking with the established custom of more than  years.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statements and the collective agreement signed by the parties on  November , and in particular of the fact that: () the question of the failure of the company CONAPROLE to deduct union membership dues from wages was resolved after one month, as the complainant acknowledges, and the Labour Inspectorate in a ruling of  November  issued a warning to the company; () under the terms of the collective agreement, the disciplinary measures, which in the union's view were motivated by the union's actions, expire after a period of  days and are not recorded in the files of the workers concerned; () the company board, in accordance with the collective agreement, agrees to reinstate Mr. Carlos Allegranza and within  days to consider his reinstatement at his original place of work; () the other trade union official Mr. Ramn Vitalis will remain suspended, in accordance with the collective agreement, and his conduct will be reviewed by a commission made up of representatives of the National Labour Directorate and the PIT-CNT, it being understood that the commission's conclusions will not be binding but will be taken into account by the board in making its decision.
.Noting that the parties concluded a collective agreement ending the dispute which arose during the collective talks, and noting in particular the fact that the events in question and the collective agreement date back to , the Committee considers that it can do no more than take note of the collective agreement in question and respect the wishes of the parties involved and the manner in which they decided to deal with the matter of the disciplinary measures, particularly given the fact that, according to the Government, the complainant has not provided any details concerning the names of most of the employees who were disciplined and gave only a verbal account of the cases in question. The Committee has recalled on previous occasions, with regard to the reasons for dismissal, the activities of trade union officials should be considered in the context of particular situations which may be especially strained and difficult in cases of labour disputes and strike action (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee therefore asks the Government to ensure that trade union officials enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such as suspension and dismissals. Noting that, according to the complainant, the bipartite commission agreed that Mr. Vitalis must be given access to all the records in order to enjoy all the appropriate safeguards, the Committee deplores that CONAPROLE informed him that only the conclusions would be made available to him. The Committee firmly hopes that this will be taken into account when the case of Mr. Vitalis is reviewed by the commission.
.As regards the complainant's allegations that () three trade union officials were disciplined following information meetings in January  and () CONAPROLE representatives have indicated that any claims by workers, even through the labour courts, will result in a loss of trust in the worker concerned or be considered as an act of bad faith, while meetings have been prohibited and trade union officials have been barred from entering places of work, thus breaking with the established custom of more than  years, the Committee points out that the Government has not sent its observations on the matter and requests it to do so.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve this report and in particular the following recommendations:(a) Noting that, according to the complainant, the bipartite commission agreed that Mr. Vitalis must be given access to all the records in order to enjoy all the appropriate safeguards, the Committee deplores that CONAPROLE informed him that only the conclusions would be made available to him.

75,".This complaint was presented in a communication from the Association of Banking Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) dated  June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the Association of Banking Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) states that on  January  it lodged a complaint with the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security (IGTSS) concerning anti-union conduct by Lloyds Bank (BLSA) Limited against members of the banking union. The complainant adds that in an IGTSS administrative decision dated  March , Lloyds Bank (BLSA) Limited was fined R.U., (one thousand, four hundred and forty readjustable units), as a penalty for the following anti-union conduct in violation of paragraphs  and , Article , of Convention No. : (a) awarding bonuses in  to staff who worked during collective protest action; (b) only nominating non-union members for executive posts; and (c) granting a salary increase of  per cent in  to non-union members. Lloyds Bank (BLSA) Limited subsequently submitted a request for review to the IGTSS and, as a back-up, an application for hierarchical remedy to the Executive Power. The complainant adds that on  February  the Executive Power, citing errors of interpretation of the facts and of the applicable legal principles, revoked the administrative decision handed down by the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security dated  March  imposing punitive action on Lloyds Bank for involvement in acts of anti-union discrimination. The complainant annexes copies of the report of the legal advisory office of the General Labour Inspectorate and of the administrative decisions handed down by the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security and by the Executive Power.
.The complainant adds that it was informed of the Executive Power's administrative decision on  February  and that within the legal deadline it lodged an action for annulment of the decision with the Administrative Court. Lodging an action for annulment entails a judicial process which last an average of three years. The complainant explains that the Administrative Court does not specialize in collective labour law and that, therefore, a complaint lodged by a trade union relating to anti-union conduct by a transnational enterprise will take at least nine years to determine. The time already spent and that will continue to be spent in litigation is testimony to how suitable national mechanisms are for obtaining redress for violated legal rights.
.In conclusion, the complainant declares that Conventions Nos.  and  have not been respected in this case.
.In its communication dated  January  the Government states as follows: () on  March  the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security handed down an administrative decision - concluding the corresponding administrative investigation - in which Lloyds Bank (BLSA) Limited was fined for infringement of international labour Convention No.  as a result of anti-union conduct; () Lloyds Bank (BLSA) Limited made the corresponding applications for administrative remedy against the administrative decision in accordance with the provisions of article  et seq. of the National Constitution, that is to say a request for review and an application for hierarchical remedy; () on  February  the Executive Power, delivering its decision on the hierarchical remedy sought, revoked the administrative decision handed down by the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security, rendering the punitive action invalid; () on  June  the Association of Banking Employees of Uruguay presented a complaint to this body concerning the administrative decision handed down by the Executive Power, maintaining that it contains errors both in its reasoning and its substance; and () furthermore, the AEBU concurrently lodged an action for annulment with the Administrative Court to obtain the annulment of the Executive Power's decision.
.The Government stresses that the Administrative Court is the highest jurisdiction for administrative matters, that it tries requests for the annulment of definitive administrative instruments, judging their lawfulness. When it hands down the final judgement it either confirms or annuls the contested instrument. If it hands down a decision for annulment, the instrument is extinguished automatically, the extinction applying retroactively, the scope of the extinction being examined on a case-by-case basis. In the case under consideration, the annulment process referred to is currently at the proof stage, the request having been responded to by the administration, meaning that several procedural stages still remain to be completed (the parties' allegations, the report of the State Attorney-General) before a final decision is reached. The Government states that it will inform the Committee on Freedom of Association at the appropriate time of the results of this judicial process.
.The Committee observes that the allegations in this case refer to acts of anti-union discrimination by Lloyds Bank against workers belonging to the Association of Banking Employees of Uruguay. More specifically, the complainant organization alleges that on  January  it lodged a complaint with the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security of the Ministry of Labour concerning salary increases for non-union members, the appointment to executive posts only of workers not belonging to the union, and the granting of bonuses to workers who carried on working during a collective dispute.
.The Committee notes that in its reply the Government states as follows: (i) on  March , following an investigation, the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security of the Ministry of Labour handed down an administrative decision in which it imposed a fine on Lloyds Bank for infringement of international labour Convention No.  as a result of anti-union conduct; (ii) the enterprise applied for an administrative remedy against the administrative decision of the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security; (iii) on  February  the Executive Power revoked the administrative decision handed down by the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security penalizing the enterprise; (iv) on  June  the Association of Banking Employees of Uruguay applied for an administrative remedy and an application for annulment with the judicial authorities (Administrative Court) against the administrative decision handed down by the Executive Power; and (v) the judicial process is at the proof stage, meaning that various procedural stages still remain to be completed before a final decision is reached.
.With respect to the allegation concerning a salary increase of  per cent for workers who were not affiliated to the union in , the Committee notes that, as the complainant points out, and as the administrative decisions of the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security and of the Executive Power show, the increase did not become effective for union members initially. Although it was subsequently also granted to them, notably following collective action by the union, the Committee considers that union members clearly were prejudiced due to their trade union membership. In these conditions, the Committee, stressing that ""no person shall be prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ), requests the Government to take steps to ensure that in future such discriminatory acts do not occur.
.Turning to the allegations relating to bonuses granted during a collective dispute to workers not belonging to the union, the Committee observes that on the one hand, the administrative decisions of the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security and of the legal advisory office provide as follows:...Thus, it is fully proven in these proceedings that the advantages referred to were granted exclusively to officials who were not members of the union and during a period of considerable conflict in the banking sector given that the renewal of the collective agreement was being negotiated;andIf the measure is neither in the nature of a sanction, nor constitutes a reward for excellent work independently of trade union membership as maintained by Lloyds Bank in a line of argument that it has now abandoned, the question should be asked what its true purpose is. And that purpose can be no other than the one mentioned in the report of the legal advisory office ... to reward during periods of conflict, staff who do not support trade union measures. This impairs trade union activity leading to the discriminatory anti-union conduct constituting the complaint.On the other hand, the Committee observes that the Executive Power's administrative decision revoking the decision of the General Inspectorate of Labour provides as follows:... It appears from the documentation available that the bonus was not granted to all non-union employees, but to a number representing less than  per cent of non-union employees, meaning that this award of bonuses cannot be deemed an act of discrimination against union members. Bonuses are not a form of compulsory remuneration but are sums of money that the employer, without being obliged to",0,1996,Uruguay
76,"pay them, decides to grant to those officials he believes deserves them ... .
.In this connection, notwithstanding the Executive Power's statement in its administrative decision that the bonuses were not granted to all workers who were non-union members, the Committee observes that no trade union member received a bonus and that the bonuses were granted during a period of conflict related to the negotiation of a collective agreement. This being the case, the Committee considers that granting bonuses to non-union member staff - even if it is not to all non-union workers - and excluding workers who are union members from such bonuses during a period of collective conflict, constitutes an act of anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No. . The Committee therefore requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure against the repetition of such acts.
.Concerning the allegation relating to the appointment of non-union workers to executive posts, the Committee observes that the administrative decisions of the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security and of the legal advisory office provide that... The infringement of Convention No.  is proven in these proceedings in that it is evidently impossible for staff who are members of the banking union to be promoted to executive duties. It is not then a matter of making the employer responsible for proving his claims by producing generic and negative proof, but of carefully analysing the concrete elements of proof made available in these proceedings. Reference can therefore be made to testimonial declarations and documentary proof in support of the conclusion that the bank's promotion policy has been discriminatory vis--vis AEBU members ... Of the declarations made in the above-mentioned proceedings, emphasis is placed on those which relate to the personal experiences of members who received proposals of promotion on condition that they ceased their membership (Mr. Vietez and Mr. Tucuna) as well as those of current executives who were promoted once they had ceased their membership ... the declaration made by Mr. David Oscar Vietez takes on fundamental importance in clarifying the subject in question. He testifies having received from Mr. Mximo Domnguez the insinuation that if he ceased his membership of AEBU he had a chance of being appointed as an executive. This leads us to the conclusion that there was clear anti-union conduct which was repeated over time, mention being made in various testimonies of specific cases of workers who were promoted to managerial positions once they had ceased their membership.The Executive Power's administrative decision revoking the decision of the General Inspectorate of Labour provides as follows:Our judicial practice in the labour sphere distinguishes as a determining factor in the duties of executive and managerial officials, as distinct from other officials, their leading role in decision-making and in guiding the enterprise. This is why it is not possible to restrict the selection process for the enterprise's executive staff, which cannot be seen to be discriminatory. It has not been proven that the cessation of membership of officials was due to promotion to executive positions as, in the cases referred to in these proceedings, the promotion occurred a number of years after the cessation of membership, and thus a causal link cannot be established between the two events.
.The Committee observes that the conclusions of the administrative decisions of the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security and of the Executive Power differ. Given this situation, the Committee considers that it does not have sufficient information to determine whether it was for anti-union reasons that the executive posts were reserved only for workers who did not belong to the trade union organization. In these conditions, the Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the Administrative Court's decision as soon as it is handed down.
.Lastly, the Committee notes with concern that the alleged acts of discrimination in this case were reported to the administrative authorities in January , that three years and two months later, in March , the General Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security of the Ministry of Labour handed down an administrative decision imposing punitive action on the enterprise in question, that one year and  months after that, in March , the Executive Power ruled on the applications for remedy made by the enterprise, revoking the administrative decision of the Labour Inspectorate, and that in June  the complainant initiated administrative and judicial actions against the administrative decision of the Executive Power (according to the Government in its January  reply the process is still at the proof stage). While noting that over six years have passed since the complaint was initially lodged through administrative channels, the Committee observes that in a recent case it examined relating to a complaint against the Government of Uruguay, it had already had occasion to regret the slowness of administrative inquiries into acts of discrimination and had requested the Government to take measures to ensure that in future investigations of this kind were completed rapidly (see rd Report, Case No.  (Uruguay), paras.  and (b)). In light of the foregoing and recalling that ""cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.  should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really effective. An excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination (...) constitutes a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ), the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future, in the event of complaints of acts of anti-union discrimination, the corresponding authorities immediately carry out an investigation and take the appropriate measures to remedy the proven acts of discrimination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With respect to the allegation concerning a salary increase granted to workers not affiliated to the AEBU trade union, the Committee, while emphasizing that nobody should be subject to discrimination in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present, requests the Government to take measures to ensure that similar acts of discrimination do not occur in the future.(b) In relation to the allegations concerning the bonuses granted to non-union workers during a collective conflict, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that such actions, which are contrary to Convention No. , do not occur.(c) As regards the allegation concerning the appointment to executive posts at Lloyds Bank only of workers not belonging to the union, the Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the Administrative Court's decision on this matter as soon as it is handed down.(d) Recalling that cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.  should be examined rapidly so that the necessary remedies can be really effective, and that an excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination constitutes a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future, in the event of complaints of acts of anti-union discrimination, the corresponding authorities immediately carry out investigations and take the appropriate measures to remedy the proven acts of discrimination.",1,1996,Uruguay
77,".At its meeting in March , the Committee formulated the following recommendation on this case: ""Regarding the dismissal allegedly on financial grounds of  workers four days after the end of the dispute in the Perses SA enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for the dismissals and, should it find that they were ordered on anti-union grounds, to take steps to have the persons concerned reinstated in their jobs. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the subject"" (see nd Report, para. ). At its meeting in November , the Committee took note of the Government's statements according to which the General Inspectorate for Labour and Social Security was beginning an investigation into the allegations (see th Report, paras.  and ). Subsequently, in a communication of  March , the Government stated that the investigation was at the evidence-gathering stage, i.e. was in the process of receiving and collecting the evidence submitted to it by the parties involved, mainly in the form of testimonial evidence, and that it had not yet reached any definitive conclusions on the matter. The Government added that when the administrative procedure reached its final stage, it would inform the Committee of its findings.
.At its meeting in November  (see th Report, paras. -), the Committee took note of this information and, since the inquiry had already taken one year, expressed the hope that the administrative authority would expedite the matter and requested the Government to take steps to that end. The Committee awaited the final outcome of the inquiry.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that during the evidence- gathering stage of the inquiry into the dismissals in question, one purpose of which is to allow the parties to substantiate their respective positions, only the defendant company, Perses SA, had presented itself, the Peres SA Staff Association having failed to do so. The Government also states that the information collected during the proceedings is insufficient to allow definitive conclusions to be reached on the content of the complaint, and the General Inspectorate for Labour and Social Security was therefore withdrawing the file.
.The Committee takes note of this information and regrets that the Peres SA Staff Association did not present itself at the evidence-gathering stage of the inquiry requested by the Committee. Under these circumstances, given that the allegations date back to April  and taking into account the lack of interest shown in the case by the complainant organization, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the allegations.
.At its meeting of March , the Committee made the following recommendation: ""Regarding the dismissal allegedly on financial grounds of  workers four days after the end of the dispute in the Perses S.A. Enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for the dismissals and, should it find that they were ordered on anti-union grounds, to take steps to have the persons concerned reinstated in their jobs. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on this subject"" (see nd Report, para. ). During its previous examination of the case in November , the Committee noted the Government's statements that the General Inspectorate for Labour and Social Security was carrying out an investigation into the allegations made (see th Report, paras.  and ).
.In a communication dated  March , the Government states that the investigation is at the preliminary stage, i.e. the evidence presented by the parties concerned, consisting mainly of eyewitness accounts, is being collected and processed and that therefore no final conclusions have yet been reached on the matter. The Government adds that when the administrative procedure under way reaches its final stage, the Committee will be informed of the outcome.
.The Committee takes note of this information and since the inquiry has already taken one year it hopes that the administrative authority will expedite the process and asks the Government to take steps to this end. The Committee awaits the final outcome of the inquiry.
.The complaint appears in a joint communication from the Uruguayan Health Federation (FUS) and the Perses SA Staff Association (AFP) dated  September . The Government replied in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their joint communication of  September  the Uruguayan Health Federation (FUS) and the Perses SA Staff Association (AFP) allege that a dispute arose in the middle of April  over the unjustified dismissal of a union member working at Perses SA (he crashed into a vehicle, but his responsibility was not established). The dispute went through a number of stages and reached its height when the General Assembly of the health union decided on  August  to call a general strike from  August. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security was given ten days' notice of the Assembly's decision so that all possible means of conciliation could be resorted to before it took effect. At the same Assembly it was decided who should be on emergency duty in order to guarantee a minimum service. It should be mentioned here that the enterprise uses colour codes (red, yellow, green) to reflect the seriousness of a situation, red being the most serious and indicating that a life is in danger. (It is assumed that  per cent of the daily phone calls received by the enterprise warrant the red code, the rest being described as banal.)
.The complainants add that the Ministry of Labour issued a ruling declaring that the services provided by the enterprise are essential (with a view to establishing minimum services), but the complainants object that this undermines one of the fundamental pillars of collective labour rights, namely self- defence, as it denies workers the possibility to defend their own interests - a principle that is embodied in the Constitution. There can be no functional collective right or effective freedom of association if one of its fundamental pillars (self-defence) is absent; without that, freedom of association is completely worthless.
.Moreover, the ruling referred to in the complaint is not objective, since it is excessively broad in its definition of the services considered to be essential. Specifically, the complainant organizations disagree entirely that first-aid services, polyclinic services, nursing auxiliaries, the maintenance workshop, the accounts department and the administrative department are essential services, as this list covers virtually the entire Perses SA staff.
.Although the complainants recognize that the right to self-defence, which is embodied in the Constitution, conflicts with other fundamental rights such as the right to health, they consider that the Ministry of Labour's ruling, which is based on an act of doubtful constitutionality, shows a bias on the part of the State in favour of the enterprise and thus undermines the constitutionally consecrated right to strike. The powers conferred on the State by section  of Act No.  are of an exceptional nature and therefore cannot be used indiscriminately.
.The complainants add that, as a result of this ruling, the health union decided to suspend the measures adopted and also, ten days later, the dispute itself. In spite of this, four days after the dispute had been ended, the enterprise, which is not making a financial loss, decided to dismiss  workers citing financial reasons linked to the dispute.
.In its communication of  December  the Government states that Perses SA, the enterprise where the dispute referred to by the complainants arose, operates in the field of medical assistance, providing mobile medical emergency services in the form of first aid at home, at the enterprise or on the road, transport by ambulance and medical care in its polyclinic. These services are provided to members of the Mobile Coronary Unit, which intervenes in cases of emergency, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, heart attack, road accidents, etc. The Unit has a membership of ,, which is over  per cent of the population of the country's capital, and the medical personnel providing the service directly are highly qualified. If the measure adopted by the AFP union had been implemented, a large percentage of the population of the capital would have had no coverage in the event of emergencies endangering their life, health, etc.
.The Government explains that, on  April , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security embarked upon tripartite negotiations with representatives of Perses SA and of the Perses SA Staff Association and Uruguay Health Federation over complaints relating to the dismissal of a staff member six months before, sanctions, the staff rules and working conditions. After a number of tripartite meetings at which records were kept (a copy of which was sent by the Government), the enterprise agreed to discuss all the points raised except for the dismissal of a single staff member. The trade union rejected this proposal and, though negotiations continued to take place, began to take measures against the enterprise (its members",1,1995,Uruguay
78,"refused to answer phone calls during their half-hour break, which is in violation of the collective agreement that they have signed). As a result, the enterprise refused to deduct union dues from the payroll, which is also a violation of the same agreement on its part.
.A number of possible solutions were proposed, always with the mediation of technical officials of the Ministry, including special salary increments, but the trade union rejected these and decided to call a general strike as from  August , which meant that it would provide no medical assistance (including emergency care).
.It is apparent from the record of the meeting on  August , which was attended by representatives of the AFP, FUS, the enterprise and the Ministry of Labour, that various draft agreements presented by the Ministry of Labour were accepted by the representatives of the enterprise but not by the representatives of the workers, who stated officially that the general strike would begin on  August , as decided by the workers' assembly.
.During the ensuing days the Ministry of Labour and Social Security made various approaches to the two parties separately in an attempt to reach an agreement and avoid the implementation of the measures decided by the trade union.
.According to the record of the  August  meeting, the AFP was called in on  August to receive a proposal for negotiations aimed at ending the dispute; the workers' representatives stated that the proposal would be submitted to the workers' assembly to be held on  August . The record goes on to state that the Ministry of Labour was informed by telephone of the assembly's decision to maintain the general strike as from  August, three-and-a-half hours before the measure was actually implemented.
.With the strike, which would deprive , associate members of health coverage, about to begin imminently, the Ministry of Labour called together both parties in order to decide what minimum emergency services should be covered. The meeting was attended by representatives of the enterprise but not of the union. In the absence of any union representatives, the Ministry of Labour asked Perses SA to state what services in its opinion needed to be maintained in order to protect the life and health of members of the Mobile Coronary Unit (record of the meeting of  August ). Given the nature of the services provided by the enterprise (medical attention in critical situations such as emergencies, heart attacks, respiratory arrest, road accidents, etc.), it proved difficult to determine which services a priori were not really essential, though this would have been easier if representatives of the union involved had been there to give their opinion.
.Finally, in the light of the foregoing, the Minister of Labour and Social Security proceeded to issue a ruling on  August  that declared the services provided by the Mobile Coronary Unit to be essential and arranged for a small group of people to be on duty in order to provide a minimum emergency service, in accordance with information supplied by the enterprise and criteria determined by the Ministry of Labour, and for a fixed period. This decision complies with the principles and criteria of the supervisory bodies of the ILO with respect to essential services.
.In line with the precepts of the Committee on Freedom of Association, negotiating arrangements and conciliation procedures were organized in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in order to resolve the dispute, all of which ended with the withdrawal of the representatives of the workers simultaneously with their call for a strike.
.The preambular part of the ministerial ruling of  August , a copy of which was attached by the Government, shows that it was handed down only after various attempts at conciliation had failed, as provided for in the Constitution which requires the State to protect the health and safety of its inhabitants and in accordance with the international undertakings Uruguay has entered into as a Member of the ILO and with the declarations of the ILO's supervisory bodies regarding restrictions on the right to strike. The substantive part of the ministerial ruling, having declared the essential nature of the services provided by the Mobile Coronary Unit, refrained from extending the measure to the entire staff but required only that a minimum service be provided as indicated under paragraph  and for a fixed period of time.
.Moreover, in this instance the AFP's decision to call a general strike is obviously out of all proportion with the dismissal of a single worker who it felt had been unjustly dismissed, especially since procedures exist to contest such cases which in the last resort may be settled in court. In such an important area as health, and ultimately human life, the State cannot, as do the complainants, describe the implications of most of the requests for medical attention received by the Mobile Coronary Unit as ""banal"". Only after a medical diagnosis, which obviously requires the presence of a doctor, can the nature or gravity of an ailment, which in all events merits proper attention, be evaluated.
.The Government also disagrees with the complainants' argument that ""there can be no functional collective right or effective freedom of association if one of its fundamental pillars (self-defence) is absent"". The Government observes that a survey conducted by the ILO in  on the system of labour relations in Uruguay concluded that ""self-regulation has already been tried by several trade unions but, to our knowledge, it has never yet resulted in a set of self-regulation standards designed specifically for - and acceptable to - all the interested parties. We consider it advisable that the attempt at self-regulation be undertaken in the first place by the PIT-CNT, for example in the form of a trade union's code of conduct for essential strikes that could contain instructions on prior notice, the use of all possible means of peaceful resolution of the conflict, informing the public of the reasons for the strike, the holding of votes by those concerned, proposals with respect to the minimum services to be maintained, etc."".
.In conclusion, the Government states that it has acted throughout in accordance with the principles defended by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the ILO, by initiating negotiation and conciliation procedures in order to resolve the dispute, encouraging the workers to participate in determining which services should be maintained during the general strike, and finally, once the services provided by the Mobile Coronary Unit were declared to be essential, insisting only on a small number of people being on duty in certain sectors and for a specific period of time. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security has in this instance complied with clear constitutional precepts (Carga Magna, article ) which require it to protect the health and life of the population. In the light of the foregoing, the Government requests the Committee on Freedom of Association to reject the complaint.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations claim that, on the occasion of a general strike in the health sector, the Ministry of Labour did not accept the emergency standby services decided on by the FUS and declared the services provided by the Perses SA Mobile Coronary Unit to be essential, while the minimum services to be maintained - and which from its point of view are too extensive - were determined by ministerial ruling. The complainant organizations also allege that, four days after the dispute ended, the enterprise, which is not operating at a loss, decided to dismiss  workers citing financial reasons linked to the dispute.
.Regarding the fact that the minimum services to be maintained in the Mobile Coronary Unit were determined by ministerial ruling (and that the standby services decided on by the AFP were not accepted), the Committee has stated on previous occasions that the ""determination of minimum services and the minimum number of workers providing them should involve not only the public authorities, but also the relevant employers' and workers' organizations"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th (revised) edition, , para. ). In the present case, the Committee notes the Government's statement - confirmed in the text of the ministerial ruling of  August  - that the Ministry of Labour invited the union side to determine the minimum emergency services that should be covered and that the union representatives did not attend the meeting. Consequently, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further.
.Regarding the allegation that the minimum services established for the Perses SA Mobile Coronary Unit were too extensive, the Committee notes the Government's statement that the services provided by the enterprise include response to critical situations (emergencies, heart attacks, respiratory arrest, accidents, etc.) and that only after a medical diagnosis (which obviously requires the presence of a doctor) is it possible to determine the gravity of an ailment. The Committee further notes that, according to the",-1,1995,Uruguay
79,"ministerial ruling, the following areas required a minimum service:Emergency and first-aid servicePolyclinic service - minimum serviceOperations centreNursing auxiliaries - minimum serviceMaintenance workshop - minimum serviceAccounts department - minimum serviceAdministration - minimum servicePharmacy - minimum serviceControl centre and suppliesIn this connection, the Committee has considered on previous occasions that ""definitive ruling on whether the level of minimum services was indispensable or not - made in full knowledge of the facts - can be pronounced only by the judicial authorities, in so far as it depends, in particular, upon a thorough knowledge of the structure and functioning of the enterprises and establishments concerned and of the real impact of the strike action"". (See Digest, op. cit., para. .) That said, it would not appear at first sight that the list of minimum services laid down in the ministerial ruling is excessive, especially considering that the enterprise is providing an essential service in the strict sense of the term.
.Finally, regarding the dismissal allegedly on financial grounds of  workers four days after the end of the dispute in the Perses SA enterprise, the Committee regrets that the Government has sent no observations on the subject. The Committee therefore requests the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for the dismissals and, if it finds that they were ordered on anti-union grounds, to take steps to have the persons concerned reinstated in their jobs. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the subject.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Regarding the dismissal allegedly on financial grounds of  workers four days after the end of the dispute in the Perses SA enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for the dismissals and, should it find that they were ordered on anti-union grounds, to take steps to have the persons concerned reinstated in their jobs. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the subject.",-1,1995,Uruguay
80,".The complaint was submitted in a joint communication dated  February  from the Inter-Trade Union Assembly - Workers' National Convention (PIT-CNT), the Union of Workers, Employees and Supervisory Personnel of the Uruguyan Tyre Factory (FUNSA Trade Union) and the Uruguay Rubber Federation (F.C. del U.). These organizations submitted further information in a communication of July . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  February , the complainants allege that the Government's recent liberalization policy, which includes the removal of measures to protect the nation's industry and the integration of Uruguay in the MERCOSUR (common market of the southern cone), has initiated processes of reorganization, industrial restructuring and probable regional agreements with multinational corporations. For this reason, on  April  the Uruguay Tyre Factory cancelled the existing collective agreement, causing a collective dispute, with workers put on unemployment insurance rolls and subsequently a sit-down strike. The dispute was resolved through a temporary agreement in force until the end of . The complainants add that after the employer's refusal to reinstate the workers put on unemployment, its obstruction of bargaining on the workers' cooperative for the footwear sector and its refusal to negotiate a collective agreement, a new dispute broke out with rotating strikes and all workers being put on unemployment. After the plant was occupied by the workers and they were removed by the police, in January  the enterprise dismissed  workers, including  trade union officials who were on unemployment in December .
.The complainants point out that the Government proposed a settlement, which the trade union rejected on the grounds that it allowed the dismissal of the  workers (including the  trade union officials) without taking into consideration trade union immunity. They add that the Government did not investigate the matter to determine whether there had been a breach of freedom of association.
.In their communication of July  the complainants point out that an agreement reinstating some of the dismissed officials was finally reached with the enterprise, and that the Government actively participated in the negotiations which led to the final agreement. None the less, they criticize the Government for neither investigating nor taking a stand on the dismissal of trade union officials, and maintain that these were anti-union dismissals. Finally, the complainants state that the dispute at the FUNSA enterprise demonstrates that Uruguayan law does not grant effective protection to trade union officials.
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that in the dispute between the FUNSA enterprise and its workers the Ministry of Labour and Social Security held protracted and intense negotiations with both parties to reach an agreement, and that its participation was decisive in concluding the final agreement of  March . According to documentation sent with the communication, this included several meetings at the Ministry, the presentation of settlement proposals by the Ministry, requests for reports from the enterprise, and the inspection by the Ministry of environmental and working conditions at the enterprise.
.The Government states that the final agreement was reached according to a formula worked out by the three parties, and denies that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security accepted the dismissal of trade union officials during the negotiations. It points out that the parties agreed that the dismissals were caused by an excess of manpower, and that it considered that it should not take a stand on the matter or investigate it, in so far as the parties had been engaged in negotiations and reached an agreement; it considered that it would be inappropriate to disregard the will of the parties. The Government points out that according to the report (which it encloses) requested by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security from the FUNSA enterprise on its situation and prospects, the company faced serious problems adapting to the national and international markets (domestic recession, import of better-priced tyres, reduction of exports, etc.) and so decided to cut back its staff.
.Finally, the Government states that the Uruguayan industrial relations system has special characteristics since it has no standards for trade union rights, and it emphasizes the need to establish clear rules for the protection of trade union officials. The Government has given this matter consideration in various bills it submitted to Parliament.
.As regards the alleged deficiency of Uruguayan legislation regarding protection against anti-trade union discrimination, the Committee refers to the conclusions it reached on this subject at its May  meeting concerning Case No.  (Uruguay), which reads as follows: (see rd Report, paras.  and ):As regards the allegation concerning the lack of legislative guarantees against anti-union discrimination, the Committee, at its February  Session, considered that the current system of protection against anti-union practices (heavy fines in the case of anti-union dismissals, administrative orders to reinstate workers so dismissed and the possibility of closing down the enterprise) ""does not infringe Convention No. "" but ""could be improved in so far as accelerating the procedure"". (See th Report, Case No.  (Uruguay), para. .)The Committee has noted the reasons for which the Government deems it desirable and necessary to have clear and precise rules of the various aspects of collective labour law since at the moment there are only very few statutory provisions in this area. In this regard, the Committee wishes to point out that its mandate consists in determining whether any given legislation or practice complies with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining laid down in the relevant Conventions and that it is not within its terms of reference to give an opinion on the type or characteristics - including the degree of legislataive regulation - to be followed by the industrial relations system in any particular country. The Committee requests the Government to submit any draft law on freedom of association and collective bargaining to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations so that it may examine it in the context of Conventions Nos.  and .
.The Committee observes that the other allegations refer to the anti-trade union dismissal of  workers and  trade union officials from the FUNSA enterprise, after various sit-down strikes which occurred because of a collective dispute that began in April , and after the Government's refusal to investigate or take a stand on the events leading up to these allegedly anti-union dismissals.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations (in their last communication) and the Government agree that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security actively and decisively took part in the search for a settlement of the dispute, thus permitting the parties to reach an agreement. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government states that the parties agreed the dismissals were caused by an excess of manpower, and that it considered that it should not take a stand on the matter or investigate it, in so far as negotiations were held between the parties and led to an agreement, and it would have been inappropriate to disregard the will of the parties.
.The Committee observes that the agreement signed by the parties provides for the reinstatement of six trade union officials, the creation of a cooperative (with machinery given by the enterprise) with  of the dismissed workers, and monetary compensation for the rest of the dismissed workers.
.In these circumstances, since the parties concluded an agreement regarding the dismissals, which brought the dispute to an end, the Committee considers that this complaint does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that the present case does not call for further examination.",0,1992,Uruguay
81,".The Committee examined this case at its May  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see rd Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June )). The Government sent further observations in communications dated  September ,  May and  September .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May , allegations remained pending concerning the dismissal, in , of many strikers and trade union leaders from the National Paper Factory (FNP), immediately after the complainant organization and the FNP had signed an agreement putting an end to the strike and the dispute between them. This agreement provided that the enterprise would not resort to reprisals against the strikers. The Committee noted that an administrative inquiry was under way and would culminate in a ministerial decision determining the validity of the complaints and the measures to be taken.
.The Committee made the following recommendation to the Governing Body on the allegations pending (see rd Report of the Committee, para. ): the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the administrative inquiry that was undertaken following the dismissal of trade unionists and trade union leaders and if, as the indications seem to confirm, this inquiry reveals that the dismissals were based on anti-union motives, urgently to take measures with a view to securing the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and the strict application of the penalties prescribed by law.
.In its communication of  September  the Government of Uruguay, referring to the Committee's conclusions reached at its May  meeting, in which it pointed out that the alleged dismissals had occurred after lawful strike action (rd Report, para. ), states that, although it is true that during the dispute between the National Paper Factory and its staff, the enterprise, alleging that the restructuring would necessarily involve a cut in staff, dismissed more that  workers including a number of trade union representatives, it is far from certain that a work stoppage exceeding three months might be described as a ""legal strike"", especially when it seriously threatened a factory's productive capacity, discouraged new investment, increased the risk of confrontation and undermined the climate of healthy industrial relations conducive to equitable solutions.
.The Government adds that after the corresponding administrative inquiry in the National Paper Factory had been carried out, in compliance with all the procedural guarantees, the competent officials of the Labour Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour advised that severe penalties should be taken against the enterprise after noting, amongst other things, that there was sound evidence that the enterprise had used the pretext of rationalization to undermine trade union activity. The Government endorses the report of the administrative inquiry carried out by the qualified advisers of the General Labour Inspectorate, in which it notes ""the dismissal of approximately  per cent of the executive and auditing committees"" and "" per cent of the trade union representatives negotiating on the wage boards and National Labour Directorate ... because of trade union activity ... with the intention of breaking up the trade union organization"". Consequently, the General Labour Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security adopted a resolution on  August , in accordance with the regulations in force, imposing a heavy fine (equivalent of , US dollars) on the National Paper Factory. The Government adds that the administrative measures adopted are separate from the legal proceeding initiated by the workers before the judiciary to redress their grievances.
.As regards the Committee's request that inquiries into situations such as the one in this case should be completed rapidly, the Government points out that although the CUOPYC submitted a complaint to the Secretary of State on  January , the date upon which proceedings commenced, the seriousness of this complaint and the actual context in which the dismissals occurred (when the enterprise found itself having to undertake restructuration) warranted a more careful analysis and therefore took longer to determine than might have been wished.
.In its communications of  May and  September , the Government states that the National Paper Factory requested that the admininistrative proceedings stipulating financial penalties for violation of freedom of association should be reviewed and that consequently it was concluded that: the enterprise had been studying the possibility of carrying out a restructuring programme of its staff and industrial reconversion for years, which caused a dispute ending with the signing of a collective agreement in ; in December  the enterprise dismissed  workers; the need for restructuration was the outcome of a painstaking and long-term analysis; the Trade Union Centre of Paper and Cellulose Workers (CUOPYC) denounced the dismissals as being violations of ILO Conventions Nos.  and , as it considered the dismissals of trade union leaders and militants to be a means of trade union persecution; the administration considered the situation as presented to be a violation of trade union rights and heavily fined the enterprise.
.Similarly, the Government points out that after having carefully analysed the facts, it was observed that: the large majority of dismissed workers were not trade unionists; the dismissed workers were scattered throughout all branches of the enterprise, including managerial staff and workers at a much lower level; the dismissals were decided upon in accordance with impartial and well-founded criteria; the trade union still seems to exist; the development of industrial relations has been normal and satisfactory; the enterprise has not recruited new staff since the time it dismissed the workers in question; productivity has increased noticeably; five of the dismissed trade union leaders who had brought legal action against the enterprise reached an agreement which was upheld by the judicial authority, whereby they were paid a sum equivalent to one and a half times the compensation for a usual dismissal. As a result of this agreement, no more dismissals were made and the question of trade union persecution was not raised. Finally, the Government reports that the judicial complaint submitted by two dismissed trade union leaders had been rejected by courts of the first and second instance and that the other dismissed workers had accepted compensation paid them.
.The Committee notes that, in accordance with the conclusions it reached at its May  meeting, the General Labour Inspectorate of the Minister of Labour and Social Security imposed a heavy fine (the equivalent of , US dollars) on the National Paper Factory, after having proved through an administrative inquiry that trade union officials had been dismissed on account of their trade union activity. Similarly, the Committee notes that according to the Government, five trade union leaders who had instigated legal action challenging their dismissal reached an agreement with the enterprise, after being paid compensation, and that the judicial complaint submitted by other trade union leaders was rejected; and that finally, the remaining trade union leaders and workers accepted the compensation paid to them by the enterprise.
.In this respect, the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the principle according to which it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, as set out in Convention No. , is accorded by legislation which enables employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to dismiss any worker, if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that: () although the dismissals took place in the context of a collective dispute, they also took place during a process of restructuring by the enterprise for economic reasons; () subsequently, the enterprise did not hire any new workers; () a heavy fine was imposed on the enterprise; and () the enterprise reached an agreement with all the dismissed workers except two of them, whose judicial complaints were rejected by the judicial authority. Taking into account all the foregoing elements, the Committee considers that it need not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle according to which it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, as set out in Convention No. , is accorded by legislation which enables employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to dismiss any worker, if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities.(b) Taking into account the specific circumstances of this case and the manner in which the dismissals took place, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the allegations.
.In a letter dated  July  the Trade Union Centre of Paper and Cellulose Workers (its Spanish acronym being: CUOPYC) lodged a complaint alleging violations of freedom of association. The Government furnished its observations in a",0,1991,Uruguay
82,"letter dated  January .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Trade Union Centre of Paper and Cellulose Workers, after stating that it is made up of the workers of the National Paper Factory (FNP), one of the most dynamic and modern firms in the paper industry, explains that the collective agreement of September  regulated various aspects of industrial relations (system of work in certain sectors, annual leave, attendance bonuses, etc.) and stipulated that in the event of a strike the vital or critical sectors of the enterprise would be kept running, though at a reduced pace ( per cent of maximum capacity), in a spirit of good will so that as soon as the strike was over activities might be resumed normally.
.The complainant organisation states that in August  the Ministry of Labour and Social Security outlined the framework for the negotiations of the wages boards, proposing long-term agreements (of ,  or  months) to catch up with real wages. The complainant adds that negotiations were begun with the firm in May  but without any positive outcome, so that partial work stoppages, in pursuance of the exercise of the right to strike and in line with the provisions of the collective agreement of September , were organised in the month of August.
.The complainant states that the FNP, confronted with these measures, not only refused to negotiate on wage increases, but also decided to suspend activities in various sectors of the factory (continuous processes II and III and the JAGEMBERG winding machine), including in the non-""critical"" sectors. The complainant adds that, after taking these measures, the firm decided to close from  to  August  and subsequently suspended activities in various sectors.
.The CUOPYC states that the FNP went too far with the conditions it was trying to impose on the negotiations (restrictions on the right to strike, work on national public holidays, etc.) and that finally, following the issue of the Order of the Ministry of Labour of  December , a document was signed in which both sides undertook to promote an industrial relations climate compatible with the operating needs of the enterprise; the document specified that no reprisals would be taken in respect of the dispute that had been under way until that date. The complainant adds that although the enterprise had undertaken, in the document signed at the Ministry of Labour, not to resort to reprisals,  workers were dismissed on  December . Among the  (representing  per cent of the staff) were five titular and five deputy members of the executive committee of the union and four members of its auditing committee, i.e. altogether  per cent of the union executive. The complainant specifies that, at the same time as it dismissed the majority of the members of the union executive, the firm put out an explanatory leaflet describing its situation and including a study undertaken by consultants.
.The complainant states that in Uruguay there are insufficient legislative guarantees in regard to respect for trade union activities; in fact there is no legislation protecting workers against anti-union discrimination. The complainant also states that there are signs that the Supreme Court of Justice is giving ground in this area. Lastly, it states that it has approached the Ministry of Labour and Social Security with a view to securing the reinstatement of the dismissed leaders and the enforcement of the penalties provided for in Decree No. /. It has also applied to the competent courts for the payment of the wages that remained unpaid during the lock-out and for compensation for the moral damage caused.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that throughout the dispute between the CUOPYC and the FNP, the Ministry of Labour, through the National Directorate of Labour, constantly endeavoured through conciliation efforts to bring the two sides to an understanding and that subsequently, when a complaint was lodged for infringement of trade union rights, it intervened in the administrative inquiry in which the two sides submitted evidence. This administrative inquiry is continuing and will culminate in a ministerial decision that will determine the validity of the complaints and the measures to be taken. This administrative procedure is distinct from the ordinary legal proceedings to which the parties may also have recourse.
.The Government states that it deplores situations such as the one that gave rise to the complaint - namely a situation in which the dismissal of a large number of workers coincided with a struggle to secure pay negotiations and to determine conditions of work collectively. The Government adds that this reaction is caused by the organisation of revolving strikes which considerably disrupt activity and frequently entail irreparable damage for production capacity. The consequences of labour disputes of this kind are felt long after the struggle has ended and seriously compromise job stability given the particularly vulnerable situation of the Uruguayan economy. Furthermore, the Government emphasises that the complaint also relates to the employers' refusal to bargain collectively, and states that the lack of a legal provision making negotiation compulsory is a serious shortcoming in Uruguayan law (the Government adds that it has tried by various means to establish rules on collective agreements and that provision is made in the preparatory work already accomplished for an obligation in this respect).
.The Governments adds that the complaint in question is a case in point that illustrates how necessary it is to have rules that can be applied in the event of a labour dispute. In this respect it should be mentioned that the Uruguayan legal system makes no legal provision - or at least no suitable provision - concerning procedures in respect of dispute settlement, collective bargaining, the protection of trade union activity, lockouts, the effects of strikes, workers' representation in the undertaking, etc. The Uruguayan trade union movement has traditionally opposed any legislative intervention on these matters and has made this one of the fundamental points of its policy and its programme of demands. Moreover, the scant case law on the subject is insufficient to furnish the social partners with applicable criteria.
.In these circumstances, the Government states that it is convinced the Committee will agree that it is desirable and necessary for Uruguay to establish clear and specific rules on collective labour law. In this respect the Government states that: () it has been acknowledged on several occasions that the present shortcomings are among the factors that discourage both national and foreign investment; () Uruguay has a fragile and dependent economy and it is essential for it to make preparations for the process of integration with Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay; this situation is decisive in the shifting of productive efforts towards sectors in which Uruguay has a comparative advantage in the new community space; () the Uruguayan Constitution has long recognised the right to strike and requires the laying dwon of regulations for the exercise of this right, a task which no democratic government has achieved to date; () the present Government which, in its electoral programme, undertook to introduce provisions on industrial relations, has submitted draft legislation to Parliament establishing a certain number of rules in respect of the exercise of the right to strike; this draft legislation was first examined by ILO experts, whose recommendations were followed; from the outset, the Trade Union Centre in question has expressed its total opposition to the approval of statutory provisions; it should be mentioned that the Government, in its draft legislation, has made provision for workers who are dismissed for exercising their right to strike to be able to apply for reinstatement, and establishes rules and safeguards concerning labour disputes in addition to the provisions on the bilateral settlement on which the parties themselves may agree; () an ILO technical mission which, in , studied the industrial relations system in Uruguay, stated expressly in its report that it was desirable to devise reliable and efficient regulations.
.As regards the protection of trade union activity in Uruguay, the Government draws attention to Decree No. / of  February  the terms of which are similar to those in Convention No. , even though worded differently and more categorically. The Decree, which is currently in force, does not provide for dismissal to be invalidated in cases of discrimination or infringement of trade union guarantees, but stipulates that the enterprise in question is liable to a fine representing between one and  days' remuneration. The fine concerns the responsibility of the enterprise vis--vis the Administration but individual workers also have rights of which they may avail themselves if the employment contract has been breached. Moreover, Act No. , makes provision, in the event of failure to respect labour standards (including international labour Conventions) for warnings, establishment closures or fines.
.The Government adds that the Administrative Court has upheld several decisions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security demanding the",0,1991,Uruguay
83,"reinstatement of trade union activists unfairly dismissed for their trade union activities as well as fines for non-compliance with these decisions. In one of the sentences handed down following the refusal of an enterprise to reinstate workers who had been dismissed for trade union reasons (November ), this court decided that the amount of the fine should be calculated on the basis of the wages of the entire staff since the issue was the defence of the right to organise of all the workers and not just of one of them. The ordinary labour court, however, has taken different decisions because of the lack of provisions, under law or collective agreements, requiring the employer to reinstate a trade union leader who has been dismissed because of his activities. In one case the court ruled that the question of reinstating workers did not arise since Act No. , provides for fines in the event of non-application of international Conventions that have been ratified, but does not mention reinstatement. In another case the judges did not call for the workers to be reinstated since there was disagreement among the staff, which meant that the reinstatement would have raised difficult practical problems, though it would not have been impossible from the legal point of view, and they sentenced the enterprise to pay three times the statutory compensation which was also being claimed. Sometimes the Uruguayan courts have considered the unlawful dismissals that have followed a strike to be abusive (hence the right to special compensation apart from the statutory compensation). According to the Government, the right solution would seem to be for it to be left to the judges to decide whether a contract should be allowed to lapse if there is reason to think that maintenance of the employment relationship is impossible (trusted personnel, confrontation following the dispute, etc.) so as to avoid reinstatement giving rise to serious disturbances and disrupting the harmony that should prevail in any work setting.
.The Committee observes that the allegations presented by the complainant organisation relate, on the one hand, to the dismissal of  workers, including  trade union leaders, from the National Paper Factory (FNP) and, on the other hand, to the inadequacy of legislative guarantees against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.As regards the dismissal of  workers (including  trade union leaders) immediately after the CUOPYC and the FNP had signed an agreement putting an end to the strike and the dispute between them, the Committee notes that an administrative inquiry is under way and will culminate in a ministerial decision determining the validity of the complaints and the measures to be taken. The Committee wishes to emphasise that, in this case, real factors exist indicating the anti-union nature of the dismissals: () they took place following lawful strikes; () they concerned half the executive committee of the union and many other workers; () in the agreement signed by the parties to bring the dispute to an end, the enterprise undertook not to resort to reprisals against the strikers. The Committee also notes the Government's statement that it deplores situations such as this one, i.e. a situation in which the dismissal of a large number of workers coincided with a struggle to secure wage negotiations and determine conditions of work collectively.
.In these circumstances, the Committee regrets that the administrative inquiry has not yet been completed although the dismissals took place in November  and it requests the Government to take measures to ensure that this inquiry and any other inquiries that might be conducted in the future yield results quickly. The Committee also requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the administrative inquiry and if, as the indications seem to confirm, the latter reveals that the dismissals constituted anti-union discrimination, to take measures urgently to reinstate the dismissed workers and to apply strictly the penalties prescribed by law.
.As regards the allegation concerning the lack of legislative guarantees against anti-union discrimination, the Committee, at its February  Session, considered that the current system of protection against anti-union practices (heavy fines in the case of anti-union dismissals, administrative orders to reinstate workers so dismissed and the possibility of closing down the enterprise) ""does not infringe Convention No. "" but ""could be improved in so far as accelerating the procedure"". (See th Report, Case No.  (Uruguay), para. .)
.The Committee has noted the reasons for which the Government deems it desirable and necessary to have clear and precise rules on the various aspects of collective labour law since at the moment there are only very few statutory provisions in this area. In this regard, the Committee wishes to point out that its mandate consists in determining whether any given legislation or practice complies with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining laid down in the relevant Conventions and that it is not within its terms of reference to give an opinion on the type or characteristics - including the degree of legislative regulation - to be followed by the industrial relations system in any particular country. The Committee requests the Government to submit any draft law on freedom of association and collective bargaining to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations so that it may examine it in the context of Conventions Nos.  and .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the administrative inquiry that was undertaken following the dismissal of trade unionists and trade union leaders and if, as the indications seem to confirm, this inquiry reveals that the dismissals were based on anti-union motives, urgently to take measures with a view to securing the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and the strict application of the penalties prescribed by law.(b) The Committee regrets that the above-mentioned administrative inquiry has not yet been completed although the dismissals took place in November  and it requests the Government to take measures for the inquiry, and any other inquiry that might be undertaken in the future, to be completed rapidly.(c) The Committee requests the Government to submit any draft law on freedom of association and collective bargaining to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations so that it may examine it in the context of Conventions Nos.  and .",1,1991,Uruguay
84,".The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), and decided to examine certain allegations at its February  meeting, since the Government's observations on this matter had been received only a few days before its November  meeting. (See th Report, paras.  and .)
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The PIT-CNT alleges in its communication dated  June  that on  December  the Puma Trading SA enterprise, which employs  workers, dismissed Messrs. Carlos Bez and Williams Maciel, members of the executive committee of the Trade Union of Manual and Office Workers of Puma (SOEP) in violation of the provisions of Convention No. . In support of its allegation, the PIT-CNT highlights the following indications of the anti-union nature of the dismissals: () in , labour-management relations became extremely difficult, being constantly obstructed by the employer; () the trade union leaders concerned were on the list of candidates for union elections which were to take place four days after the dismissal; () the dismissal cited ""grounds of improving the service"" as the persons involved ""failed to meet the general requirements of the enterprise""; () hearings held in the Ministry of Labour established the impossibility of technically justifying the grounds cited by the employer; () the work records of the persons dismissed were excellent, since they had met all the requirements for admission to the enterprise and for employment in an occupational category involving considerable responsibility; () the enterprise did not give any explanation of the reason it had chosen this particular time to carry out the dismissal.
.The PIT-CNT emphasises that Uruguayan legislation still includes provisions which allow free dismissal of workers without giving reasons, on the sole condition that the statutory compensation is paid; the system of small fines imposed by the Ministry of Labour or the Labour Inspectorate (Decree No.  of  February ) in the event of acts of anti-union discrimination is absolutely inadequate, given the reality of the Uruguayan trade union movement. In this particular case, the National Labour Directorate was manifestly ineffective, with the result that the conflict was aggravated; the mediating officials refrained from acting and left it to the parties to settle the dispute.
.The PIT-CNT also alleges that in the second half of , the ""Sociedad Annima Cristaleras del Uruguay"", which employs about  workers, introduced changes in its machinery. According to the trade union, this new machinery involved technological changes, which meant that the collective agreement in force since  and registered with the Ministry of Labour, which had been concluded between the parties and governed this important subject, should have been applied. The trade union organisation demanded that the Ministry ensure compliance with this agreement. Industrial action was also taken, consisting, inter alia, in the exercise of the right to strike with partial and total stoppages in the enterprise. At a time when both parties were willing to negotiate, the trade union decided to cease one of the stoppages, and the enterprise took this opportunity to accuse Messrs. Carlos Chemino (treasurer of the Workers' Union of Cristaleras del Uruguay) and Anbal Lpez (shop steward) of flagrant misconduct, and dismissed them in September  in violation of Convention No. . The dismissal of these leaders was clearly motivated by anti-union aims, on the pretext of misconduct which had not been committed, as the Ministry of Labour concluded in its decision. Nevertheless, the enterprise compelled them, under threat of losing their jobs and unemployment benefit, to accept the dismissal compensation provided for by national legislation, in an attempt to ""clear themselves"" of the violation of trade union rights. According to the PIT-CNT, this paying off, which occurred seven months after the termination of the employment relationship, does not cancel out the act of discrimination, and the investigation should continue.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that violation of the standards laid down in Conventions Nos.  and  (including cases of anti-union dismissal) may be administratively penalised by a reprimand, fine or closure of the establishment for up to six days (Act No. .); in the latter case, a ministerial resolution, with reasons adduced, is required. The amount of the fine ranges from one to five days' pay for each worker involved in the infringement or likely to be affected by it. In the case of dismissals discriminating against trade union leaders, the approach adopted by the General Labour Inspectorate, which is the labour law enforcement body, has been to fix the amount of fines taking into account the wages of all the workers employed by the enterprise, on the assumption that an act of anti-union discrimination affects all employees. The administrative procedure consists of investigating the facts, attempting conciliation, and ordering reinstatement if the discrimination took the form of a dismissal, failing which the enterprise is penalised. It is thus easy to see that the system of penalties applied not only is not weak but, on the contrary, has a deterrent effect.
.The Government adds that another procedure, entirely independent of the administrative one, is the judicial procedure, under which workers may claim the pay and compensation due to them and request an annulment of their dismissal before the ordinary courts. This judicial procedure includes summary proceedings which may be concluded in the second instance with a decision of the Labour Appeals Court. High court appeals may also be lodged with the Supreme Court which admits actions brought against anti-union dismissal, irrespective of the amount of the claim.
.The judicial procedure is laid down in Legislative Decree No. . of  April , which provides for a procedure which is shorter than the ordinary one. However, the time necessary to obtain a definitive ruling is admittedly so long that the parties often prefer to reach agreements before exhausting the judicial procedure. A procedural reform has been implemented with the introduction of trial by hearing, effective in November . One of the results envisaged is to speed up trials, including those of labour cases.
.Without prejudice to the above-mentioned independent relationship of the administrative and judicial procedures, it is obvious that any agreements or settlements reached by the parties, either in court or out of court, mean that the administrative proceedings in the case are closed.
.More specifically, the Government maintains that there were no violations of Conventions Nos.  and  in the Sociedad Annima Cristaleras del Uruguay enterprise. According to the Government, the event that sparked off the dispute, which resulted in the dismissal of two workers, among other things, was the carrying out of tests ordered by the management on one of the machines of the ""inspection department"" with a view to achieving continuous production with considerable efficiency gains. The trade union representatives considered that the tests required by the enterprise involved technological change and restructuring of tasks, and therefore requested that the collective agreement of  December  be applied. The enterprise later suspended the test and the trade union took industrial action. Finally, the Labour Relations Division of the National Labour Directorate, following a visit by a labour inspector to the enterprise, ruled that the type of tasks involved in the tests required by the enterprise did not constitute a technological change, nor did it involve a risk to the workers' safety or health.
.The Government states that the two employees of the Sociedad Annima Cristaleras del Uruguay were dismissed by the enterprise on the grounds that they had obstructed the resumption of work once the dispute had been settled and the industrial action had ceased. As usual, the reasons for the ruling of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on these dismissals were given: after a series of hearings and an examination of the documents presented by the parties, it was concluded that the versions of the facts clearly contradicted each other, and that there was not enough evidence indicating that the enterprise had acted with the intention of carrying out anti-union discrimination. What was confirmed by the workers' own statements was that they had ordered the stoppage of machinery once the dispute had been settled. In any case, there are discrepancies in the significance attributed by the parties to this attitude. In particular, it should be pointed out that the workers were not compelled to accept the amount of compensation. On the contrary, it was freely accepted by the workers, who not only did not go to court to claim compensation or request that their dismissal be annulled, but, in agreement with the enterprise, applied to the ordinary labour courts for confirmation of a settlement concluded out of court, without the participation of the Ministry or the trade union. Obviously, this agreement, confirmed by the court, meant that the",0,1988,Uruguay
85,"Ministry suspended all administrative proceedings on the matter.
.Lastly, the Government states that it considers that the complaint of anti-union practices in the Puma Trading, SA enterprise does not prove that Conventions Nos.  and  have been infringed. The Government points out that, by a document dated  May , the workers involved accepted payment of the dismissal compensation, which was made by the enterprise, without bringing any claims before the court.
.The Committee notes that the current allegations refer, on the one hand, to the inadequacy of the current system of protection against anti-union practices and, on the other, to the dismissal of four trade union leaders.
.As regards the first point, the Committee notes that the current system of protection against anti-union practices includes access to the administrative authority for purposes of conciliation or investigation of the facts, and that fines may be imposed or the establishment closed down temporarily if, for example, the enterprise fails to comply with an administrative order to reinstate the worker affected by discriminatory dismissal; the current system also provides for the possibility of requesting compensation and annulment of dismissal before the courts. In these circumstances, the Committee, while concluding that the current system does not infringe Convention No. , believes that it could be improved in so far as accelerating the procedure. In this respect it notes the recent reforms carried out to speed up proceedings in labour cases.
.As regards the dismissal of trade union leaders, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Messrs. Carlos Chemino and Anbal Lpez did not appeal to the courts against their dismissal, that the Sociedad Annima Cristaleras del Uruguay enterprise cited the grounds that these workers had obstructed the resumption of work once the dispute had been settled and the end of industrial action had been announced, and that the administrative investigation had come up against clearly contradictory versions of events, although it was confirmed by the parties (who, however, attributed a different significance to this fact) that the workers dismissed had ordered a stoppage of machinery in the Sociedad Annima Cristaleras del Uruguay enterprise after the collective dispute in this enterprise had been settled. In view of the contradiction between the allegations and the Government's reply as regards the circumstances of these dismissals, the Committee is unable to reach conclusions.
.As regards the dismissal of Messrs. Carlos Bez and Williams Maciel, trade union leaders in the Puma Trading, SA enterprise, the Committee notes that the situation differs considerably from the one mentioned above. Thus, the Government fails to give any precise information as regards the specific grounds for the dismissal of these trade union leaders and confines itself to describing the possibilities of obtaining legal protection available to the persons concerned and to affirming that they accepted payment of the dismissal compensation. The Committee would mention several indications of the anti-union nature of the dismissal of these leaders put forward by the complainant, and regrets that the Government has failed to comment on this matter although the dismissals occurred in December . The Committee notes, however, that according to the complainant in  labour-management relations became extremely difficult, being constantly obstructed by the employer and that the trade union leaders concerned were on the list of candidates for union elections which were to take place four days after the dismissal. In addition, hearings held in the Ministry of Labour established the impossibility of justifying the grounds cited by the employer: the work records of the persons dismissed were excellent, since they had met all the requirements for admission to the enterprise and for employment in an occupational category involving considerable responsibility; and the enterprise did not give any explanation of the reason it had chosen this particular time to carry out the dismissal.
.In these circumstances, considering that acceptance of dismissal compensation without contesting it before the courts does not in itself imply that the dismissal is legitimate, the Committee draws the Government's attention generally to the importance of forbidding and penalising in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment such as dismissal or other prejudicial measures; this is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have an assurance that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee draws the Government's attention generally to the importance of forbidding and penalising in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment such as dismissal or other prejudicial measures; this is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have an assurance that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade union.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Inter-union Plenary of Workers-National Workers' Convention (PIT-CNT) dated  June . The Government replied in a communication dated  May  and two further communications dated  October  (received in the ILO on  October ).
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ) and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the PIT-CNT states that it considers that the Uruguayan Government is systematically infringing ILO standards on protection of freedom of association (Convention No. ) and the promotion of collective bargaining (Convention No. ) in order to impose its economic policy as regards the wages of public and private employees. Already in  the PIT-CNT wrote to the ILO denouncing the fact that the continuing operation of Act No.  and Legislative Decree No.  (the former enacted at a time when freedoms were suspended and the latter at the height of the dictatorship) was aimed at preventing the exercise of the right to strike and allowed wages to be fixed unilaterally by the Government without taking account of the opinion of the trade union organisations and employers' associations.
.As regards wage fixing in the private sector, the PIT-CNT refers to the wage councils. Set up in  by Act No. , these are autonomous bodies for tripartite consultation consisting in three government delegates and two each for employers and workers, operating at branch level, which adopt their decisions by a majority vote; this means that if the employers' and workers' representatives agree on a formula, it could be approved against the wishes of the government delegates. The entire system of collective labour relations in Uruguay was to a considerable extent structured around these bodies, with employers' and workers' organisations being constituted at branch level. This meant that these councils enjoyed a high level of prestige and their reconvening in , after more than  years of inactivity, was generally welcomed. However, on the grounds that this reconvening did not comply strictly with legal formalities (since there had been no elections of representatives of occupational organisations, the latter being directly appointed by the most representative organisations), the Government decided to treat the decisions of the wage councils as draft resolutions requiring the approval of the Executive in the form of a decree. It based its reasoning on Legislative Decree No. . As was pointed out in the report of the ILO mission on industrial relations in Uruguay carried out in , this ""means that the Government has the last word in wage bargaining, as it may refuse to sign the relevant decree if the decision submitted to it runs counter to its incomes policy"". This is precisely what has been happening systematically in the last rounds of wage negotiations, to the point that it can be said that the wage councils no longer exist as such, as they have been drained of their substance by the Government and now exist only in form (see the above-mentioned report, page ).
.The situation has worsened since the beginning of June . Thus, the government representatives on the wage councils - convened for a new round starting on  June - confined themselves to stating that no wage agreement will be ""confirmed"" if it does not conform to the guide-lines laid down by the Government, irrespective of the will of the parties to collective bargaining (both employers and workers). The trade union movement cannot accept this attitude, which reflects a tendency to surrender to the guide-lines imposed by international financial organisations, whose chief priority is the repayment of the foreign debt, which in turn means purely and simply the loss of the purchasing power of wages.
.As regards collective agreements, the dearth of legislation on this subject which is characteristic of Uruguay makes it difficult to extend collective agreements as methods of wage",1,1988,Uruguay
86,"fixing, since their compulsory effect throughout the branch is not ensured and there are no express provisions laying down the obligation for employers to negotiate. The traditional practice in Uruguay has been to submit bilaterally negotiated collective agreements for ""confirmation"" by the wage councils, turning them into decisions to make them generally applicable. The very structure and independence of these bodies favoured this practice, which thus allowed a unique development of independence of the parties even within a tripartite framework. This was clearly shown by the proliferation of collective agreements approved in this way in the s. To a certain extent the expectations raised by the reopening of the wage councils in  went in this direction, as was confirmed by the practice followed in many of the councils. The Government, however, in violation of its obligations as laid down in international standards, has taken it upon itself to obstruct, make difficult and even prevent the development of negotiation between the social partners. At first it brought pressure to bear through its delegates in the wage councils so that agreements between employers and workers would conform to its guide-lines; it then refused to retain in its decrees the wage clauses which did not follow these guide-lines (as the ILO mission was able to observe (see its report, page )); lastly, it went as far as to refuse to recognise the validity of the ""medium- and long-term agreements"" which had not been confirmed by the Executive. (Decrees Nos. / and / prescribe as a condition for the validity of wage clauses in agreements drawn up in the wage councils, that the latter ""be confirmed by decree of the Executive Power"".) The Minister of the Economy himself stated before the Committee on Labour Affairs of the Senate of the Republic that ""obviously, the conditions laid down by the Executive Power shall be taken into account in deciding which agreements it is willing to confirm"".
.The PIT-CNT adds that despite the express opposition of the trade union movement, section  of Legislative Decree No.  adopted during the dictatorship is still in force. This section provides that ""the Executive Power, jointly with the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and, where appropriate, with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, may, if it considers it necessary and appropriate: ... (e) issue rules respecting wages and, in particular, establish occupational categories and regulate the remuneration of workers employed in the private sector"". These extensive powers assigned to the Executive run counter to the system of wage councils and to collective bargaining. The use of such powers to supplant the will of the parties to labour relations constitutes a practice in violation of Conventions Nos.  and , as it restricts the freedom of association and independence of the parties which these Conventions guarantee. Despite this, the Uruguayan Government has thus made increasing use of Legislative Decree No. , in blatant violation of international and national legislation, bringing unlawful pressure to bear on the entire system of collective labour relations and ensuring that it has the last word in fixing wages according to its own unilateral decisions of economic policy. A complete picture of this policy emerges from the decrees issued in February of the years ,  and  (/, / and /) by which general wage increases were fixed directly by the Executive without convening the wage councils and without taking any account of the opinions of the sides of industry. The Minister of the Economy has made the following statement: ""the Executive Power,"" said the highest exponent of the economic policy, ""apart from refusing to confirm some agreements, has not taken any measures beyond this, except for the periodical decision, adopted out of considerations of timeliness and appropriateness, to fix remuneration by decree. Obviously, the Executive Power does not renounce this machinery.""
.As regards collective bargaining in the public administration, the PIT-CNT alleges that the Uruguayan Government prevents the development of collective bargaining in the public administration, whether in the central administration or in autonomous bodies and decentralised services. This is a failure to comply with Convention No. , which allows only public servants engaged in the administration of the State to be excluded from its scope. The Government has attempted to conceal its violation of international standards in this field by agreeing to meet with trade union organisations of public servants both of the central administration and of the autonomous bodies and services. However, the methods used have merely confirmed its ignorance of such standards in addition to violating the Constitution of the Republic itself. Thus, at the level of the central administration, the Government was represented by the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of the Economy and the Planning and Budget Office, which generally confined themselves to stating their own wage guide-lines. The complainant affirms categorically that this has nothing to do with genuine collective bargaining. Still worse is the situation in the autonomous bodies and decentralised services, because in this respect the Uruguayan Government has not only violated international standards but has also disregarded the independence of such bodies, enshrined in the Constitution, by refusing on several occasions to comply with the agreements reached between the directorates of these bodies and trade union organisations.
.Starting from the beginning of June  the situation has worsened, if possible, in the public administration, both in the central administration and in the decentralised services and autonomous bodies. Thus, not even the sham negotiations which formerly took place have been opened. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that  June  was the deadline, the last time until , for drawing up the budget accounts, since no adjustments may be made in  which is an election year. This means that nearly half of all Uruguayan workers are not only prevented from participating in determining their wages, but also run the risk that for virtually two years they will have to submit to what the Government decides itself, in blatant violation of international Conventions and the most elementary democratic standards.
.The PIT-CNT alleges further that on  December  the Puma Trading SA enterprise, which employs  workers, dismissed Messrs. Carlos Bez and Williams Maciel, members of the executive committee of the Trade Union of Manual and Office Workers of Puma (SOEP) in violation of the provisions of Convention No. . In support of its allegation, the PIT-CNT highlights the following indications of the anti-union nature of the dismissals: () in , labour-management relations became extremely difficult, being constantly obstructed by the employer; () the trade union leaders concerned were on the list of candidates for union elections which were to take place four days after the dismissal; () the dismissal cited ""grounds of improving the service"" as the persons involved ""failed to meet the general requirements of the enterprise""; () hearings held in the Ministry of Labour established the impossibility of technically justifying the grounds cited by the employer; () the work records of the persons dismissed were excellent, since they had met all the requirements for admission to the enterprise and for employment in an occupational category involving considerable responsibility; () the enterprise did not give any explanation of the reason it had chosen this particular time to carry out the dismissal.
.The PIT-CNT emphasises that Uruguayan legislation still includes provisions which allow free dismissal of workers without giving reasons, on the sole condition that the statutory compensation is paid; the system of small fines imposed by the Ministry of Labour or the Labour Inspectorate (Decree No.  of  February ) in the event of acts of anti-union discrimination is absolutely inadequate, given the reality of the Uruguayan trade union movement. In this particular case, the National Labour Directorate was manifestly ineffective, with the result that the conflict was aggravated; the mediating officials refrained from acting and left it to the parties to settle the dispute.
.Lastly, the PIT-CNT alleges that in the second half of , the ""Sociedad Annima Cristaleras del Uruguay"", which employs about  workers, introduced changes in its machinery. According to the trade union, this new machinery involved technological changes, which meant that the collective agreement in force since  and registered with the Ministry of Labour and which had been concluded between the parties and governed this important subject, should have been applied. The trade union organisation demanded that the Ministry ensure compliance with this agreement. Industrial action was also taken, consisting, inter alia, in the exercise of the right to strike with partial and total stoppages in the enterprise. At a time when both parties were willing to negotiate, the trade union decided to cease one of the stoppages, and the enterprise took this opportunity of accusing Messrs. Carlos Chemino (treasurer of the Workers' Union of Cristaleras del Uruguay) and Anbal Lpez (shop steward) of flagrant misconduct, and dismissed them in September  in violation of Convention No. . The dismissal of these leaders was clearly motivated by anti-union aims, on the pretext of misconduct which had not",0,1988,Uruguay
87,"been committed, as the Ministry of Labour concluded in its decision. Nevertheless, the enterprise compelled them, under threat of losing their jobs and unemployment benefit, to accept the dismissal compensation provided for by national legislation, in an attempt to ""clear themselves"" of the violation of trade union rights. According to the PIT-CNT, this paying off, which occurred seven months after the termination of the employment relationship, does not cancel out the act of discrimination, and the investigation should continue.
.The PIT-CNT highlights the inadequate legal procedure for processing complaints of violation of trade union rights. The procedure lasted several months and failed to consider and note other means of proof which would have provided knowledge on the basis of which a decision could have been made. The PIT-CNT also stresses the responsibility of the Ministry for the deplorable and biased intervention of the official who came to carry out an inspection at the factory; he not only ignored the trade union leaders but met only with representatives of the enterprise, which resulted in a one-sided and badly written report on which the National Labour Directorate based its opinion. Both oral and written complaints were accordingly brought against this conduct of the case before the National Labour Directorate and the National Inspector, with a request for an immediate investigation. The case has still not been dealt with by the above-mentioned agency. Moreover, the collective agreement provides for intervention by the Ministry of Labour in order to settle disputes, which was not done. In addition, the delay in replying to the appeal for annulment and to the appeal lodged with the higher instance against the Directorate's decision (although the time-limit for considering it is  days) constitutes a real denial of justice. The complainant considers that this delay clearly runs counter to Article  of ILO Convention No.  as it fails to establish reasonably efficient machinery to regulate the practical aspects of implementing this standard.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that it considers that the PIT-CNT's complaint fails to meet the required receivability criteria since it is mainly confined to making sweeping judgements without referring to specific cases or points. Based on vague general information, the allegations merely extrapolate certain of the comments - also couched in general terms - made by the ILO mission on industrial relations in Uruguay carried out in , whose observations cannot be substituted for the ILO's supervisory procedures. However, bearing in mind the fact that the ultimate purpose of the procedure set up by the ILO is to promote respect of trade union rights in law and in practice and, as it has shown in the past, the Government is aware of the importance for this purpose of sending precise replies to the allegations so that they may be examined objectively, the Government will refrain in this case from formally raising the question of receivability, to which it none the less draws attention.
.First, the Government stresses the exceptional situation prevailing in the wage-fixing system in Uruguay as a result of the legislative vacuum in the wake of the de facto regime which was in power from  to . This exceptional situation made it necessary to introduce machinery and institutions combining previously-enacted legislative provisions and informal factors, which were successively applied in a process which is still under way. This process is transitional in nature and is guided by the State, with the objective of replacing administrative wage fixing which was typical during the dictatorship with free and responsible collective bargaining, mindful of the general interest.
.In order to encourage this process, the Government chose to give priority to promoting tripartism through the wage councils which had been instituted by an Act of  which for  years until  had constituted the framework for collective bargaining in the absence of other specific legal provisions. However, the possibility of objections to the validity of wage council decisions, which might be based either on doubts as to the effect of the  Act itself or on the practical impossibility of exhausting the legal procedure for the appointment of wage council members, made it necessary for the sake of legal soundness for wage council decisions to be elaborated and brought into effect by administrative decision under the provisions of Act No.  and Legislative Decree No. . These texts had vested in the Government powers to regulate through administrative channels the remuneration of workers in the private sector. After more than a decade in which collective bargaining had completely disappeared, the reopening of the wage councils proved to be a suitable instrument for promoting bargaining. Thus, they both constituted an adequate framework for negotiation, and, in the absence of legal provisions laying down the obligation to negotiate, their periodical sessions meant that such a duty existed in practice.
.Aware of these effects, the Government, as the body responsible for convening the councils, regulated their frequency so that the parties would develop bargaining to cover increasingly longer periods without prejudice to the concurrent establishment of periodical procedures for the adjustment and increase of wages. The process under way may be divided into three clearly differentiated stages: in the first stage, running from mid- to mid-, the wage councils were convened on a general basis every four months and their agreements also covered a four-month period; in the second stage, from mid- to mid-, in addition to the general four-month meetings, the conclusion of ""long-term agreements"" in certain branches of activity was promoted; these agreements, negotiated bilaterally while the systems of four-monthly adjustment were maintained, covered longer periods of up to two years; lastly, in the third stage, which has lasted since mid-, the wage councils were convened in every case to conclude bilaterally negotiated ""long-term agreements"" covering at least  months and always subject to four-monthly adjustment. Since the wage councils had been set up, the Government had only availed itself in exceptional cases of the legal provisions empowering it to fix wages administratively except in so far as putting its decisions to effect.
.Throughout this process, the participation of state representatives in the bargaining bodies was aimed at safeguarding the general interest, which took the form of what was termed ""guide-lines"" intended to guide the parties with respect to the anti-inflationary policy in order to allow effective growth of ""real wages"" which had declined during the de facto regime. For this purpose, the ""guide-lines"" were linked directly and exclusively to the pricing policy, and limited the extent to which wage increases could be passed on to prices, without restricting the parties' freedom to negotiate higher amounts of remuneration, as long as they were absorbed by the enterprises, whether by cutting profits, improving productivity or any other means of reducing costs. The ""guide-lines"" respected freedom of bargaining to such an extent that, as may be seen from the studies supplied, the wage increases granted as from  consistently exceeded the limits for the mark-up of prices. This ultimately resulted in a considerable increase in real wages which, despite an annual inflation rate fluctuating around  per cent, are now some  per cent higher than in March .
.Today, just four years after the restoration of democratic institutions in Uruguay, and as a result of the process outlined above, over  per cent of workers employed in the private sector are covered by ""long-term agreements"". These agreements are essentially negotiated bilaterally and regulate wages for periods of  months on average, including both mechanisms for maintaining purchasing power which are applied at four-monthly intervals with regular corrections, and machinery ensuring real growth, also applied periodically and linked to increases in various production variables.
.With this in mind, in order to complete the transition, the Government promoted consultation with the social partners at the level of the most representative national organisations of employers and workers. These consultations concerned the adoption of a framework agreement which, in accordance with the recommendations of the ILO mission, would in future draw up the principles for definitively setting up a system upon which a consensus has been reached, based on free and responsible collective bargaining, and mindful of the general interest (the Government encloses the report of the Tripartite Seminar on Industrial Relations). The Government's decision in this respect ultimately led to ratification of the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) approved by Act No.  promulgated on  May .
.As regards the functioning of the wage councils, whose reconvening has been welcomed, the complainant takes exception to the fact that their decisions come into force through administrative channels, although it acknowledges that this was made necessary by the impossibility in practice of exhausting the legal procedure for designating employers' and workers' representatives who, instead of being elected, were directly appointed by the most representative organisations. This sweeping grievance claims to be founded exclusively on two brief and incomplete quotations of the extensive observations drawn up by the ILO mission on industrial relations in Uruguay carried out in , whose mandate expressly excluded the examination",1,1988,Uruguay
88,"of the application of international labour standards. The first of these quotations, which refers to a de jure opinion expressed in passing in hypothetical terms, to the effect that this procedure ""also means that the Government has the last word in wage bargaining, as it may refuse to sign the relevant decree if the decision submitted to it runs counter to its incomes policy"", is an incomplete rendering of the mission's appreciation of the system.
.In fact, as may be seen on the same page  referred to by the complainant, in the preceding paragraph the mission stated that ""the fixing of wages by decree is not only possible but is probably indispensable from the point of view of form. This is so because the wage councils are composed of delegates who are appointed and not elected (as required by the Act of ) and it could thus be alleged that there is a defect of form as regards the manner in which they are set up; such an allegation could lead to the validity of councils' decisions being questioned with some chance of success. Such validity could even be questioned on the basis of the possible repeal of the Act of , the effect of which, as has been pointed out, is currently disputed. The fixing of wages by decree is thus aimed at obviating these difficulties, as it is based on the Act of , which is still in force"". In the following paragraph the mission pointed out that it ""has not heard of any cases in which the Government refused to confirm a decision of the wage councils"", thus ruling out the possibility of a real occurrence of the de jure hypothesis outlined in the deliberately truncated quotation. The second quotation, which cannot be found on the page indicated, claims that the Government systematically refused to confirm decisions of the wage councils, which were thus drained of their substance. The vagueness of this assertion, which is utterly devoid of any factual basis and is belied by the observations of the mission, compels the Government to categorically reject it.
.As regards the collective agreements, the accusation contained in the complaint on this point is once again sweepingly vague and confined to the view, also devoid of any sound basis, that ""the Government, in violation of its obligations as laid down by international standards, has taken it upon itself to obstruct, make difficult and even prevent the development of negotiation between the social partners"". According to the allegation, this took the form of three types of behaviour which are described in sweeping terms: bringing pressure to bear through its delegates in the wage councils so that agreements between employers and workers would conform to government guide-lines; refusing to retain in its decrees wage clauses which did not follow these guide-lines and refusing to recognise the validity of the medium- and long-term agreements which had not been confirmed.
.As for the so-called ""guide-lines"", the Government again points out that, as may be seen in detail in the attached studies and as described by the report of the ILO mission already referred to, these guide-lines did not restrict freedom of negotiating wages, but the carrying over to prices of the wage increases granted in the wage councils. In other words, to quote the ILO misson: ""that is, increases of any kind could be granted in the wage councils; however, wage increases could affect prices only within the limits set by the Government. Amounts in excess of this had to be absorbed by the enterprises"" (page ). Moreover, an analysis of the results of the various rounds of negotiation in the wage councils shows that, on average, the wage increases granted exceeded in every case the limits set by the guide-lines for the mark-up of prices, which meant that there was a real growth in wages. (On this point, the Government refers to one of its enclosures entitled ""Consultation and wage policies in Uruguay, -"".)
.Furthermore, the alleged refusal to retain certain wage clauses in the administrative validation procedure is expressly and exclusively based on the observations allegedly made by the ILO mission as described on page  of its report. Again, this report was quoted incompletely, omitting the mission's statement on page  that ""following the mission, we heard that this agreement had finally been confirmed (as had others in the same situation)"".
.Moreover, it is a well-known fact that in Uruguay collective agreements have full force and are applied between the parties even without confirmation (or, strictly speaking, extension), which only gives them universal force of law over and above their applicability ipso jure between the parties. This is what was observed by the mission, so often misquoted by the complainant, which stated on this point that ""once most of the restrictions of the previous period had disappeared, the practice of collective bargaining in the private sector re-emerged with considerable momentum as from March . All of the persons who spoke with the mission pointed out that a considerable number of collective agreements of the most varied kinds were negotiated daily, although the exact figures are not known as comparatively few are registered with the labour authorities and even fewer are published. With the exception of a few cases (agreements on dismissals, agreements of the Construction League, agreements submitted to the wage councils for their confirmation), collective agreements are normally considered as private instruments which therefore do not call for compliance with any prescribed form or with any publication requirements as a condition for their validity"" (pages -). Lastly, the failure to mention any specific cases in support of the sweeping accusations on this point prevents the Government from going further. Nevertheless, it repeats once again that the recent legislative approval of the ILO Collective Bargaining Convention (No. ) is conclusive proof of its firm decision to promote, as it has done, free and responsible collective bargaining, mindful of the general interest.
.The allegation concerning administrative wage fixing, once again couched in sweeping terms and referring to the alleged ""increasing use by the Uruguayan Government of Legislative Decree No. , in blatant violation of international and national legislation, bringing unlawful pressure to bear on the entire system of collective labour relations and ensuring that it has the last word in fixing wages according to its own unilateral decisions of economic policy"" for once gives a concrete example, that of the decrees enacted in February of the years ,  and , by which wage increase percentages were fixed directly by the Executive. In this respect, it should first be pointed out that the three cases referred to, in which unilateral administrative wage fixing was resorted to, were temporary exceptions to the system of principle which, as has been pointed out, gave priority to tripartite bargaining in wage councils, and later developed into bilateral negotiation. Moreover, it must be emphasised that in all three cases this unilateral administrative wage fixing was expressly confined to the four-monthly adjustment due in the month of February and automatically expired after four months with the negotiation of subsequent adjustments.
.As regards the first Decree in particular (February ), a detailed picture of the actual circumstances leading to its adoption emerges both from the study attached to the reply as Annex I and from the report of the ILO mission (bottom of page ). These circumstances, consisting in a risk of renewed inflation, without a doubt met the criterion laid down by the Committee on Freedom of Association for recognising the legitimacy of temporary restrictions on free collective bargaining. In this respect, it should be borne in mind that in addition to being applied as exceptional measures and being limited to what was necessary (that is, to refraining from convening the wage councils for the wage adjustment due the following four-month period), these measures were in fact accompanied by adequate guarantees to protect the workers' standard of living, to the extent that the increases thus administratively decreed exceeded the inflation rate for the period covered by the administrative wage fixing.
.Moreover, as regards the decrees enacted in February of  and , it should also be borne in mind that in both cases they only covered sectors of activity which were not covered by previously negotiated ""long-term agreements"", the effect and validity of which were expressly respected. Furthermore, as regards minimum wages, they provided for the possibility of the parties negotiating higher increases bilaterally, in which case only the carry over to prices was restricted.
.As regards the alleged practices in violation of international Conventions on collective bargaining in the public administration, on this point the complaint again bases itself on an incomplete quotation from the ILO mission report. Thus, while it is true that the mission pointed out that the general development of collective bargaining in the public sector is fairly limited and precarious, it also stated that ""there is general and informal wage bargaining every four months for the purpose of adjusting the salaries of public employees, taking into account the increase in",0,1988,Uruguay
89,"the cost of living"" and that ""as we were told in trade union circles, the main problem encountered in negotiations is not so much the absence or lack of mandate of the other partner, but rather state budget constraints"". What is more, the mission pointed out that ""there are also negotiations with the Ministries to discuss specific problems"" and that ""de facto agreements are concluded in some municipalities and autonomous bodies"". Over and above the observations of the mission, the Government must make it clear that in the absence of a normative framework, the development of collective bargaining in this sector was impeded by the fact that no agreement had been reached as regards the levels at which this bargaining was to take place. There had been repeated cases of demands or terms already negotiated or being negotiated at the sectoral level simultaneously being put forward at the level of various subdivisions, thus distorting the scope of negotiation and its results. In view of this, it must be borne in mind that the Government has adopted measures to promote and encourage the development and institutionalisation of collective bargaining in the public sector. For this purpose, on  April , the Executive submitted an explanatory note together with a bill to the Legislature, proposing that regulations be issued under and effect be given to article  of the Constitution, according to which ""the law may permit commissions representing the staff concerned to be set up in autonomous bodies in order to collaborate with the directors in the execution of the rules laid down by the by-laws, the study of the budget, the organisation of services, the regulation of work and the application of disciplinary measures"". Similarly, on  January , the Executive, taking up the favourable opinion given by the tripartite group set up by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to advise it in matters relating to international labour standards, also submitted an explanatory note and a bill to the Legislature proposing and advising ratification, inter alia, of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ) ultimately approved by Act No.  promulgated on  May  and therefore due to enter into effect imminently.
.For the rest, the allegations of the PIT-CNT are confined to even more sweeping accusations which, being false, are utterly devoid of any factual basis.
.As regards the present situation, the Government must point out that, contrary to the prophecies of the complainant, today , workers in the private sector, representing . per cent of the entire workforce, are covered by  collective agreements or long-term wage agreements, essentially negotiated bilaterally since June , which regulate their remuneration for average periods of  months, and providing, by means of four-monthly adjustments, both machinery to maintain value and mechanisms to ensure real growth. This has caused dispute levels to drop to their lowest point. The Government concludes these comments, of necessity general, by repeating that it is aware that it is not the duty of the Committee on Freedom of Association to draw conclusions on the trade union situation in the country on the basis of generalisations. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that the complainant appears to have attempted to do so, it cannot fail to refer in the last instance to the objective opinion of at least one of the members of the ILO mission so often quoted in the complaint, who, in addition to stating that ""freedom of association, the independence of the parties and respect of the right to strike are still the basic tenets of labour relations in Uruguay"", concluded that ""since then () the evolution of labour relations has been very sound in many respects: there has been a return to dialogue between the public authorities, the employers and the trade unions; basic trade union rights have been restored; public employees who had been dismissed under the military regime for trade union or political reasons have been reinstated in their jobs; wages have recovered a sizeable part of their lost purchasing power; and labour disputes, after a period in which they reached worrying proportions, have started to diminish"".
.In two communications dated  October , the Government sends detailed observations denying the allegations of dismissals in the Puma Trading SA and Cristaleras del Uruguay companies.
.The Committee observes that this complaint refers to certain restrictions on collective bargaining, both in the public and in the private sectors, as well as several dismissals for anti-union reasons. Generally speaking, the Committee observes that, as regards collective bargaining, there has been a positive evolution in many respects since the complaint was presented in June . Specifically, the Committee notes with interest that Uruguay has recently ratified the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ) and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Government initiatives taken with a view to concluding a tripartite framework agreement on the collective bargaining system, and lastly, the proliferation of ""long-term collective agreements"" which currently cover over  per cent of wage earners.
.As regards the allegations relating to the right to collective bargaining of public servants and employees, the Committee hopes that the requirements of Convention No. , as well as those of the recently ratified Conventions, Nos.  and , will be fully complied with. In this respect, the Committee would refer to the comments made on Uruguay's application of Convention No.  by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at its March  meeting. The experts stressed that ""organisations of public servants who are employed in autonomous bodies and decentralised services (state enterprises) should enjoy the right to collective bargaining, since the Convention only permits the exclusion from its scope of public servants engaged in the administration of the State"". Therefore, in view of the fact that the contents of the April  bill referred to by the Government do not meet the requirements of Convention No. , the Committee fully endorses the request of the Committee of Experts that the Government take measures to include in the legislation explicit recognition of the right to conclude collective agreements of organisations of public servants in autonomous bodies and decentralised services (state enterprises) who are not engaged in the administration of the State.
.As regards the allegations concerning wage fixing through administrative channels, specifically under the terms of Decrees Nos. /, / and / (the legal basis of which was section  of Act No. ), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these were exceptional measures taken in the context of the struggle against inflation, and were limited in duration to a four-month period. The Committee also observes that these provisions referred to minimum wages and not to the possibility of limiting wage increases in collective agreements. As was expressly stated by the Government, these provisions did not prevent the parties from bilaterally negotiating wage increases in excess of those provided for in the decrees of  and , but merely limited the extent to which they were passed on to prices. In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that there has not been a violation of the right of trade union organisations to bargain collectively with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements as provided in Article  of Convention No. . It will be for the Committee of Experts to comment on the application of the Conventions concerning minimum wages ratified by Uruguay.
.As regards the alleged statements of government representatives according to which no wage agreement will be ""confirmed"", unless it respects the government guide-lines, the Committee would point out that in the Uruguayan system, what is referred to as ""confirmation"" of a collective agreement is, strictly speaking, an ""extension"" of its application to all workers employed in the branch of activity concerned even if they do not belong to the signatory trade union organisations or the enterprises to which the collective agreement applies. However, in the event of refusal to extend a collective agreement, nothing appears to prevent the workers who are not covered by the agreement to conclude other collective agreements through their trade union organisations. The Committee therefore considers that these allegations do not call for further examination.
.Lastly, the Committee decides to examine at its next meeting the allegations of anti-union dismissals in the Puma Trading SA and Cristaleras del Uruguay companies, since the Government's observations on this matter were received only a few days before the Committee's present meeting.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with interest that there has been a positive evolution in many respects as regards collective bargaining, and specifically notes the ratification by Uruguay of Conventions Nos.  and .(b) The Committee, as the Committee of Experts has already done, requests the Government to take measures to include in the legislation explicit recognition of the right to conclude collective agreements of organisations of public servants of autonomous bodies and decentralised",-1,1988,Uruguay

.The remaining allegations are contained in communications from theSingle National Trade Union of Workers in the Clothing Industry(SUA-VESTIMENTA) dated  March,  April,  August and  and  September and in a communication from the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly and the NationalWorkers' Convention (PIT-CNT) dated  May . The World Federation of TradeUnions, in a communication dated  September , and the PIT-CNT supportedSUA-VESTIMENTA'S complaint. The Government replied in communications dated October  and  June and  October .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of theRight to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise andCollective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Single National Trade Union of Workers in the Clothing Industry(SUA-VESTIMENTA) makes a series of allegations concerning infringements offreedom of association by the Chamber of Employers in the Clothing Industry(CIV) during a long labour dispute which has been growing more acute since.Although it recognises the democratic character of the Government andpoints out that civil and political freedoms are recognised in the country andthat as a consequence the principles of freedom of association are respected,SUA-VESTIMENTA states that the competent authorities have not taken effectivemeasures to prevent, in the manner prescribed in Articles  and  ofConvention No. , the very serious infringements of trade union rights whichhave occurred. Given the intransigence and anti-trade union attitude ofemployers in negotiations in the wage councils of June  (which fix minimumwages) the Executive Power decreed a  per cent wage increase with thesupport of the employers and which was rejected by SUA-VESTIMENTA on the basisof the percentage of the increase and the failure to respect the legalprovision contained in section  of Act No.  which prescribes that wagesshould be fixed by categories of workers in such a way that they areremunerated in accordance with the degree of specialisation required for theirjob. In the same way the use of homeworkers and small-scale clothing workshopsresults in over-exploitation which is compounded by the practice of employersof placing their trade union staff on unemployment insurance or dismissingworkers on the pretext that there is a shortage of work when jobs are in factbeing carried out in the above-mentioned workshops. In an attempt to pressurethe CIV into respecting the legislation, work stoppages were organised withinworkplaces extending throughout the working day. The CIV responded by:- establishing blacklists which make it impossible for trade union leadersand militant members to obtain stable employment. This is the case of RamnCceres, Secretary-General of SUA-VESTIMENTA, Harlem Olivera, DeputySecretary-General, the union leader Hugo Bergalta (a victim of slander by theemployers who accused him of discriminatory attitude based on race) and of per cent of the trade union leadership (the complainant organisation includesin an annex a list of those persons appearing on the blacklists);- dismissing or placing on unemployment insurance during the July dispute or as a result of it more than half of the  members of the nationaldirectorate of SUA-VESTIMENTA. Hundreds of workers were suspended and  weredismissed for having participated actively in the trade union measures on thepretext of alleged acts of misconduct committed during the strikes(SUA-VESTIMENTA encloses the list of persons dismissed);- assigning uniformed police to more than ten factories; when the publicclerks recruited by the employers interviewed workers to see whether they weregoing to join the strike, those who answered affirmatively were prevented fromentering;- locking in more than six undertakings those workers who were peacefullyoccupying factories without any measures being taken by the publicauthorities;- using fixed-term recruitment as a means of anti-trade union discriminationand preventing workers from joining the trade union;- misusing the unemployment insurance scheme as a means of dischargingunionised workers and subsequently recruiting other workers or giving out workto small and often clandestine workshops;- carrying out a preliminary investigation of workers seeking employment inthe clothing industry by means of agencies or undertakings which interviewedpersons close to the applicants concerning their participation in strikes,their political tendencies, etc. This occurs in several undertakings in thesector and, in particular, in Milton S.A. and OROLON S.A.;- the establishment of collective agreements between undertakings andworkers behind the backs of the trade union organisation (in the Milton S.A.undertaking a collective agreement was established which grants greater wagebenefits to workers on the condition that they do not participate in thecentral wage negotiations carried out by the trade union). SUA-VESTIMENTA thenillustrates these allegations by referring to anti-trade union acts which haveoccurred in the following undertakings: Milton, CIMPEX, EVERFIT, EL MAGO,RELOS, RODOY, ROMINA, SIDEX, CUBACAN, MOISES FELD, PAUL SHARK, FARGO,BERNALESA, RINSY, DYMAC, PRAKER, DAKAR and MANTEL..In its communication of  May , the Inter-Union Workers' Assemblyand the National Workers' Convention (PIT-CNT) point out that the return todemocracy in the country has led to a recognition of trade union organisationswhich play a proper role in the life of the country. They allege, however,that the provision contained in Article  of Convention No.  that ""machineryappropriate to national conditions shall be established ... for the purposeof ensuring respect for the right to organise"" has not been respected. InUruguay it is possible to keep active trade unionists out of employment bydismissing them since all the employer has to do is to dismiss the worker(without giving reasons) and pay the corresponding compensation. Thissituation, which is known to and ignored by the Ministry of Labour, is givingrise to a growing number of blatant acts of anti-trade union persecution.Decree No. / dated  February  establishes regulations to prohibit andimpose sanctions on anti-trade union discrimination, but does so in a purelyformal manner since it fixes very low fines (up to  or  times the dailywage) and the imposition of the fine is a matter for the discretion of theadministrative authority. It is not adequate machinery in the sense used inConvention No.  but rather one which facilitates discrimination. The Chamberof Deputies has approved a bill on the subject which does not satisfy theaspirations of the trade union movement since it results in excessiveinterference in the internal life of the trade union organisations by imposingvoting systems in the election of trade union officials. In addition to theclothing industry, trade union rights are also violated in the leatherindustry; the PIT-CNT makes the following allegations:- the dismissal of several dozen workers most of whom were works' councildelegates and several members of the trade union executive. These events havebeen denounced to the Ministry of Labour without any solution being found orany stop being put to repression by the employers. In the AZADIAN undertakingan active trade unionist was dismissed for having gone to the Ministry ofLabour and Social Security to make a formal denunciation concerning tradeunion repression by an employer. In the EXXON and SAN LUIS undertakingsworkers have been dismissed for having demanded the implementation of specificstandards issued by the competent authority in this branch of activity. Inpractice, in both the leather and the clothing industries, trade unionactivity has become a secret or clandestine activity because the simpleknowledge by the undertaking that a worker is a trade unionist results in hisimmediate dismissal or other kinds of discrimination;- in several undertakings workers are required to sign a form stating thatthey have never been a member of the leather industry trade union and thatthey will not become a member in the future. These documents must be signedbefore the worker joins the undertaking;- the unlawful and abusive use of the unemployment insurance scheme. Thus inundertakings such as OROCUER, because of an alleged shortage of work, all themembers of the works' council were placed on unemployment benefits at a timewhen work was being sent out to small workshops. The purpose of placingcertain workers - all leaders of the works' council - on unemploymentinsurance is to damage the trade union organisation and make it impossible formilitant leaders to establish contact with workers in the factory. In the sameway, in the MILENI undertaking, all the workers were placed on unemploymentbenefits and then the same workers were offered work in another undertakingwhich refused to grant them the more advantageous conditions which they hadacquired in the undertaking which had placed them on unemployment benefits. Inthis case all the workers were accepted in the undertaking with the expressexception of all the members of the works' council who remained onunemployment benefits awaiting the notification of their dismissal..In a communication dated  July , which was supported by the WorldFederation of Trade Unions, SUA-VESTIMENTA alleges that during the wagecouncil negotiations of June , employers continued to refuse to applydifferent wage rates based on wage categories despite the fact that theExecutive Power had adopted, in principle, a positive attitude by acceptingthe workers proposal to establish a preliminary categorisation which wouldupdate the text of a  arbitration award (the term ""precategorisation"" isused because rates are based on minimum wages). The trade union proposal wasincluded on an open agenda proposing a  per cent increase in the holidaywage, a  per cent increase in the Christmas bonus, the reinstatement ofdismissed workers and",0,1987,Uruguay
92,"workers who had been excluded from the industry and theestablishment of crches. The employers rejected the workers' proposal andtried to recuperate some of the benefits which the workers had alreadyachieved such as  per cent of the holiday wage and the entire Christmasbonus. After two months' negotiation the Executive Power said that it wasready to vote with SUA-VESTIMENTA a higher percentage of wage increase thanthat offered by the employers; the vote of the Executive Power referred onlyto the wage percentage and ""precategorisation"" but excluded the vacation wage,the Christmas bonus and other wage demands. SUA-VESTIMENTA decided not toreject the percentage proposed by the Executive Power ( and  per cent) butsaid that it was not enough. The CIV voted against the wage increase. In thesame way SUA-VESTIMENTA refers to a series of acts of anti-trade uniondiscrimination (blacklists, dismissals by the following undertakings: EVERFIT,DIRPLAIN (DALLAS), DEGANIA, ANTEX and EL MAGO).B. The Government's reply.In its communication of  October  the Government expresses itsbasic agreement with the complainant organisations that the most importantpoint to be stressed is the recognition that ""the return to democracy in thecountry has led to a recognition of trade union organisations which play aproper role in the life of the country"" and that ""civil and political freedomsare recognised in the country and that as a consequence the principles offreedom of association are respected""..A detailed examination of the complainants' allegations shows that thecomplaint is motivated by facts which have been allegedly committed byemployers in the clothing and leather sectors and that the Government hasplayed no part in the acts which have been committed..Since the complainant organisations make a generic charge concerning thefailure to observe the provisions of Articles  and  of Convention No. , areview must be made of measures taken for the full restoration of trade unionrights. As the complainants point out, Uruguay has enjoyed a prestigioustradition in the respect and promotion of trade union freedoms. However itmust be pointed out that this tradition has developed on the basis of a set ofminimum standards comprising only article  of the Constitution, which datesfrom  and the International Labour Conventions Nos.  and  ratified byAct No.  of  November  and the application of which, consonant withthe monist conception, is predominant if not unanimous in law andjurisprudence in the form of directly applicable principles. Indeed, as theILO itself has pointed out on more than one occasion, Uruguay was and is stilltoday a unique case as regards the abstention of the State instandard-setting. This abstentionist policy, which has been defended andchampioned by the most prestigious national doctrine, has its raison d'tre inthe trade union resistance to all standard-setting by the State based on theideological origins of the movement and encouraged by the precociousdevelopment of a modern society which reaped the benefit of periods ofprosperity and well-being, and which enabled a labour relations system to bedeveloped which was respectful of trade union rights. In this context, theonly State measure of a general nature to guarantee the free exercise of thesetrade union rights was Decree No. / of  February  to facilitate theapplication of international standards in force and the sanctions establishedby national legislation which were regulated collectively and which expresslyprohibited anti-trade union practices. This quasi abstentionist system whichas regards the coming into force of Conventions Nos.  and  lasted almost years (November  to June ) , has not been the subject ofsubstantial observations by the Governing Body of the ILO..The Government adds that shortly after the establishment of thedemocratic Government, Act No.  dated  March  marked an innovationin national practice when the so-called ""Acts"" Nos.  (on occupationalassociations),  and  (collective agreements),  (strikes), (trade union rights) and the so-called ""Basic Act"" No.  (strikes by publicofficials) - which had been brought into force by the de facto regime(-) - were ""cancelled"" and not simply repealed. This presupposed thatthere would be a restoration of the legal system which had been in forcebefore  regarding trade union rights based exclusively on the Constitution(article ) and International Labour Conventions Nos.  and , asregulated by Decree No. /. As a result, the trade union system whichoperates at present in Uruguay is characterised by State abstentionism andcollective autonomy, principles which have been systematically defended by thetrade union movement and the most characteristic labour doctrine which hasbeen radically opposed to standard-setting by the State in this sphere. Underthis system, trade unions are set up autonomously without any kind of Stateintervention, with their legal personality being recognised de facto, andwhich by the simple fact of existing and without any need for obligatoryregistration may exercise any kind of trade union activity. In the same wayfreedom of association is fully guaranteed in accordance with the provisionsof Convention No. , in particular as regards the positive and negativeaspects of trade union freedom, the freedom to establish trade unions,internal autonomy, the freedom to associate at the international level and thefreedom of an organisation to dissolve itself both in the private sector andas regards public officials..However, it is obvious - as the ILO itself has pointed out - thatalthough the state legislative abstention has proved particularly beneficialto trade union freedom, it does entail deficiencies resulting from the lack ofstandards making express provision for adequate and effective machinery forthe special protection of trade union officials and activists againstdismissal and other acts of union discrimination. This lack of standardsexpressly guaranteeing effective methods of protection, to which attentioncould be drawn before the break-up of the country's institutions only at one'sown risk, posed a danger after the re-establishment of trade union freedomswhich, although not of a generalised nature, became a source of concern to theGovernment..Thus, after  years of trade union paralysis, it was feasible to assumethat the reconstruction of workers' organisations might be resisted by someemployers since it constituted a virtually unknown practice especially in themost recently developed sectors of activity. This was particularly true whenthe lack of experience in the subject coincided in many cases with that of anew generation of trade union officials who had entered the sphere of tradeunion action in the anomalous circumstances of resistance and clandestineconflict with the regime in force. The Government was conscious of this riskfrom the beginning and considered that for the moment, given the traditionalinadequacy of internal positive law, the labour courts would have to play afundamental role in a State of law such as that existing in Uruguay. Indeed,the lack of express standards has not prevented the free evolution of nationaljurisprudence as regards the protection of basic rights and freedoms with theintroduction, under section  of the Constitution, of jurisprudence whichprovides adequate means of protection against acts of trade uniondiscrimination in so far as it has been established. In this connectionparticular importance is to be attached to the jurisprudential adoption of theconcept of protection (amparo), judicial orders not to innovate and therulings which have been made for the reinstatement of workers and theestablishment of coercive sanctions for the failure to implement such rulings.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court itself accepts the monist conception whichadvocates the incorporation ipso jure within the internal juridical system ofthe standards contained in International Labour Conventions following theirratification. Decree No. / expressly precludes the acts of trade uniondiscrimination enumerated in Convention No. . Thus, it must be concludedthat the foundation has been laid for at least the effective provision of themeasures of protection enumerated in Paragraphs (c), (d) and e) ofRecommendation No. ..Notwithstanding the above, the Government adds that it is important toemphasise that the autonomous tradition of the Uruguyan trade union movement,which as a result of its classist self-definition embodies a certain degree ofmistrust vis--vis the State, has often led it to avoid taking cases to courteven in disputes of law and to prefer in most cases recourse to strikes. Awaretoo that the habitual slowness of the legal machinery only encourages thereticence of workers to resolve conflicts by recourse to such procedures, theExecutive Power on  March  submitted to Parliament a bill which sought,by means of the establishment of summary oral proceedings in labour matters tofacilitate the defence of workers..The Government points out that even if in the final analysis the courtsare responsible for the effective remedy of infringements of trade unionrights, for its part the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has exercisedat the administrative level its supervisory powers in this respect inaccordance with the provisions of Decree No. /. To this end, whendenunciations are made concerning infringements of trade union rights, aninquiry is carried out to ascertain the truth of the allegations. If tradeunion persecution is established, a resolution is issued stating that therehas been a violation of trade union rights and workers are reinstated when theinfringement is one of dismissal; fines are applied if the resolution is notobeyed. It should be borne in mind in this connection that, although section of Decree No. / prescribes that infractions shall be punished with fines,the amount of which will depend on the number of workers affected, the GeneralInspectorate of Labour and Social Security has interpreted it in the sensethat when anti-union measures",1,1987,Uruguay
93,"are designed to prevent the growth anddevelopment of trade union activity, it must be considered that all theworkers are in the end affected even though the measures may be specificallydirected against one or more workers. Thus the size of the nominal fines hasbeen increased..In the final analysis, it must be said that the most effectiveprotection of trade union rights is provided by legislation. In thisconnection the Government draws the attention of the Committee to the factthat a bill on trade union protection has been submitted to Parliament and hasalready been approved by the Chamber of Deputies. It is designed to fill onceand for all the traditional lack of legislation in this field. While it is notappropriate here to go into its contents in detail, the Government intendsthat the measures should improve compliance with the obligations resultingfrom the ratification of Convention No. . In fact, the provisions are basedon the statements of the Committee and will ensure the effectiveimplementation of Articles  and  of Convention No.  by means of theexplicit establishment of remedies and sanctions against acts of interferenceby employers with regard to workers. Thus, provision is made for rapidprocedures and severe sanctions in the event of trade union discrimination asdefined in detail in Recommendation No. . In this connection mention shouldalso be made in the allegation of the PIT-CNT that this bill ""does not satisfythe aspirations of the trade union movement since it results in excessiveinterference in the internal life of the trade union organisation by imposingvoting systems in the election of trade union officials"". As regards thiscategorical affirmation, it should be pointed out that it refers to the finalparagraph of section  which stipulates that the supplementary guarantees tobe provided to trade union officials are reserved to those who are elected bysecret, obligatory and direct vote, without any further restrictions. Inaddition to the fact that this concept does not impose voting systems butsimply explains the granting of additional guarantees to a specific votingsystem, the Government believes that the bill conforms to the statements ofthe Committee by accepting provisions which make it mandatory for workers'organisations to elect their leaders by means of a specific voting system aslong as such a system guarantees the right to free election, for example by asecret vote. Thus even though the complainant organisations are demanding theapproval of a bill respecting trade union rights, their inconsiderate andcontinued rejection of the most minimum standard-setting by the Staterespecting their organisation, even in conditions which are completely inaccordance with Convention No. , makes such a task difficult. The Governmentasks the Committee to decide whether the provisions of the proposed billconform or not to ILO standards..As regards the events which occurred in the clothing and leatherindustry, the Government points out that both sectors, which reflect thegrowth in exports of non-traditional products, have developed basically overthe last  years, when trade union activity was for the most part prohibitedby the de facto regime. Furthermore, these two branches of activity arecharacterised by their complex and dissimilar composition. In the clothingindustry in particular use is still made of home work, family-scale workshopsand medium-size establishments which supply most of the domestic market,whereas production from export factories floods the domestic market out ofseason. Following the re-establishment of freedom of association from  March, it was clear from the beginning that both sectors were experiencingserious difficulties in the creation of a fluid labour relations system. In confrontation did not go beyond the undertaking level, with the emergenceof a number of disputes; although they were settled by arbitration through theMinistry of Labour and Social Security, they nevertheless left a trail ofintransigence. A general labour dispute broke out during the wage bargainingof June , although in fact it was limited to the larger undertakings.During this dispute confrontation became unusually harsh when allegations weremade on both sides. The employers accused the trade union officials andactivists of an abusive use of the right to strike by recourse to go-slowtechniques and working to rule, a deliberate reduction in productivity, theoccupation of workplaces on the pretext of holding assemblies or stoppages aswell as by acts of intimidation and the introduction of electricity cuts. Theworkers' organisations accused the employers of acts of indiscriminateinterference through restrictions on trade union activities, suspensions andthe dismissal of trade union officials and activists..In this context, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, faced witha shortage of material means to carry out its task in the sphere of labouradministration, dedicated all its efforts to mediation. It proposed theconclusion of a long-term agreement which, in addition to regulating workingconditions, would establish the bases of a labour relations system. Althoughafter many days of negotiation an agreement was reached which put an end tothe dispute, it did not prove possible to include the regulation of labourrelations..At the end of the dispute, the workers' organisation alleged reprisalswhich essentially concerned the acts of persecution and discredit which arethe subject of the complaint. In this respect it should be pointed out firstthat, as noted above, although there is no legislation which makes expressprovision for adequate and effective machinery to give special protection totrade union officials and activists, this deficiency is not absolute sincecase law has given rise to principles (by means of protection orders - amparoin Spanish, orders not to innovate, the reinstatement of workers and theprovision of sanctions for non-compliance) which enable the courts to makeeffective at least the protective measures contained in Paragraphs (c), (d)ande)of Recommendation No. . Thus, although the judiciary is responsible forremedying infringements of trade union rights, and although it enjoys fullindependence in this respect, the Committee's attention is drawn to the factthat the Government has no information, at least in most cases, that thevictims of the alleged acts have initiated legal proceedings..The Committee's attention is also drawn to the difficulties which arisein practice in determining the trade union status of workers whose rights haveallegedly been prejudiced. Indeed, given the absolute autonomy enjoyed byworkers as regards the organisation of their trade unions which, by the simplefact of their existence, are authorised to carry out any kind of activitywithout the need for obligatory registration and the refusal of the tradeunion movement to carry out a voluntary registration of its officials, it hasbeen necessary to investigate in each case whether in fact the worker holdsthe position of a trade union official. In most cases there is a lack ofconclusive evidence to establish such a status. These difficulties, which areaccentuated when it is a matter of deciding at the undertaking level aboutsuspensions or dismissals, are compounded by others which inevitably appearwhen efforts are made to establish the real intentions of the employer whocites as a cause for such measures either gross misconduct or lack of work, anormal circumstance in export sectors which produce merchandise on a cyclicalproduction basis..As regards the presence of policemen in the establishments on strike, itshould be pointed out that this occurred only in cases where workers hadoccupied premises and the employer asked the Ministry of the Interior toevacuate the premises in accordance with the provisions of Decree No. /.It should also be pointed out that these evacuations were in all cases of apeaceful nature..Although it is admitted by the complainant organisations, it should alsobe emphasised that in cases in which it has been shown that recourse has beenhad to fixed-term recruitment, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security hasclearly established the illicit nature of this form of recruitment and hascome out in favour of employment stability, as can be seen from thedocumentation provided by the complainants..Likewise, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has pointed outthat although the individual agreements concluded by employers with a largenumber of workers may well be considered valid as regards the greater benefitswhich are provided for each of the signatory workers, such agreements are notvalid as collective agreements and thus do not exclude workers who sign themfrom the working conditions established by collective bargaining..As regards the cases in which the workers' organisation denounced theexistence of clandestine workshops to which production from the establishmentsin dispute was transferred, the relevant inspections were carried out on morethan  occasions without it being possible to establish the allegedclandestine character of these establishments, although on several occasionsother infringements were recorded and duly punished..Finally, the Government would like to inform the Committee thatdiscussions with the presidents of the Chambers of Industry and Clothing, thePIT-CNT and the workers' organisations concerned have been initiated with aview to reaching an agreement by consensus on the establishment of anappropriate labour relations system..The Government points out that, notwithstanding the above, the Ministryof Labour and Social Security has decided to appoint a committee of inquiry todetermine the truth of the allegations made to the Committee concerninganti-trade union practices in the clothing and leather industries. Thecommittee will comprise persons of recognised expertise and independence. Thecommittee, the establishment of which has been communicated to the complainantorganisations, will be assisted by the National Directorate of Labour andSocial Security and will be required to issue within a period of  days areport on all those cases which have not been the subject of a judicialinquiry. Once the committee's",0,1987,Uruguay
94,"report is issued the Government will inform theCommittee on its conclusions and, where applicable, the measures adopted as aresult..In a communication of  June , the Government sends the texts of theconclusions of the above-mentioned committee of inquiry (see Annex I of thepresent report) and of a resolution of the Ministry of Labour and SocialSecurity to implement the recommendations of the committee (see Annex II ofthe present report), in particular concerning the establishment of a permanentarbitration committee in the clothing and leather industries. In the same way,in its communication of  October , in reply to the request by the Officedated  June  for information and comments from the committee of inquiry,set up by the resolution dated  October  to examine the various specificallegations made in the present case, the Government points out that the saidcommittee has reported. According to the Government, the committee establishedits conclusions on the basis of the results of an examination of the documentsavailable in the National Directorate of Labour (Division of LabourRelations), on court proceedings following disputes in the clothing industry,as well as on inspections carried out at its request by the GeneralInspectorate of Labour and Social Security and, in particular, informationobtained from the parties on an individual and collective basis, during thesix months of work it required to fulfil its mandate. The conclusions of theabove-mentioned committee of inquiry were accepted as substantially correct bythe parties as can be seen from the document dated  September , to whichreference is made below, in which both the representatives of the Chamber ofEmployers in the Clothing Industry and the representatives of the SingleNational Trade Union of Workers in the Clothing Industry and the PIT-CNTagreed ""that the situation in the clothing industry has been one of gradualdeterioration which has made it impossible to engage in flexible dialoguewhich is an indispensible means of collective bargaining"" and confirmed ""theirfirm intention to correct such a situation on the basis of mutual respect andconsideration"". The Government goes on to say that the Ministry of Labour andSocial Security lacks the powers to order the reinstatement of workers who mayhave been suspended or dismissed in violation of their trade union rights andthat, in Uruguay, the remedy of such violations is the responsibility of thejurisdictional bodies. The Government states that it has no information thatthe injured parties in the present case have filed judicial proceedings toobtain such redress. Furthermore, the Government points out that thearbitration committee established by a resolution dated  June  has beenmaking relentless efforts to reverse the blatant decline in labour relationsin the clothing industry and has even obtained the formal agreement of theparties to negotiate the establishment of ""a collective agre
.Although it recognises the democratic character of the Government andpoints out that civil and political freedoms are recognised in the country andthat as a consequence the principles of freedom of association are respected,
.In its communication of  May , the Inter-Union Workers' Assemblyand the National Workers' Convention (PIT-CNT) point out that the return todemocracy in the country has led to a recognition of trade union organisationswhich play a proper role in the life of the country. They allege, however,that the provision contained in Article  of Convention No.  that ""machineryappropriate to national conditions shall be established ... for the purposeof ensuring respect for the right to organise"" has not been respected. InUruguay it is possible to keep active trade unionists out of employment bydismissing them since all the employer has to do is to dismiss the worker(without giving reasons) and pay the corresponding compensation. Thissituation, which is known to and ignored by the Ministry of Labour, is givingrise to a growing number of blatant acts of anti-trade union persecution.Decree No. / dated  February  establishes regulations to prohibit andimpose sanctions on anti-trade union discrimination, but does so in a purelyformal manner since it fixes very low fines (up to  or  times the dailywage) and the imposition of the fine is a matter for the discretion of theadministrative authority. It is not adequate machinery in the sense used inConvention No.  but rather one which facilitates discrimination. The Chamberof Deputies has approved a bill on the subject which does not satisfy theaspirations of the trade union movement since it results in excessiveinterference in the internal life of the trade union organisations by imposingvoting systems in the election of trade union officials. In addition to theclothing industry, trade union rights are also violated in the leatherindustry; the PIT-CNT makes the following allegations:
.In a communication dated  July , which was supported by the WorldFederation of Trade Unions, SUA-VESTIMENTA alleges that during the wagecouncil negotiations of June , employers continued to refuse to applydifferent wage rates based on wage categories despite the fact that theExecutive Power had adopted, in principle, a positive attitude by acceptingthe workers proposal to establish a preliminary categorisation which wouldupdate the text of a  arbitration award (the term ""precategorisation"" isused because rates are based on minimum wages). The trade union proposal wasincluded on an open agenda proposing a  per cent increase in the holidaywage, a  per cent increase in the Christmas bonus, the reinstatement ofdismissed workers and workers who had been excluded from the industry and theestablishment of crches. The employers rejected the workers' proposal andtried to recuperate some of the benefits which the workers had alreadyachieved such as  per cent of the holiday wage and the entire Christmasbonus. After two months' negotiation the Executive Power said that it wasready to vote with SUA-VESTIMENTA a higher percentage of wage increase thanthat offered by the employers; the vote of the Executive Power referred onlyto the wage percentage and ""precategorisation"" but excluded the vacation wage,the Christmas bonus and other wage demands. SUA-VESTIMENTA decided not toreject the percentage proposed by the Executive Power ( and  per cent) butsaid that it was not enough. The CIV voted against the wage increase. In thesame way SUA-VESTIMENTA refers to a series of acts of anti-trade uniondiscrimination (blacklists, dismissals by the following undertakings: EVERFIT,DIRPLAIN (DALLAS), DEGANIA, ANTEX and EL MAGO).B. The Government's reply
.In its communication of  October  the Government expresses itsbasic agreement with the complainant organisations that the most importantpoint to be stressed is the recognition that ""the return to democracy in thecountry has led to a recognition of trade union organisations which play aproper role in the life of the country"" and that ""civil and political freedomsare recognised in the country and that as a consequence the principles offreedom of association are respected"".
.A detailed examination of the complainants' allegations shows that thecomplaint is motivated by facts which have been allegedly committed byemployers in the clothing and leather sectors and that the Government hasplayed no part in the acts which have been committed.
.Since the complainant organisations make a generic charge concerning thefailure to observe the provisions of Articles  and  of Convention No. , areview must be made of measures taken for the full restoration of trade unionrights. As the complainants point out, Uruguay has enjoyed a prestigioustradition in the respect and promotion of trade union freedoms. However itmust be pointed out that this tradition has developed on the basis of a set ofminimum standards comprising only article  of the Constitution, which datesfrom  and the International Labour Conventions Nos.  and  ratified byAct No.  of  November  and the application of which, consonant withthe monist conception, is predominant if not unanimous in law andjurisprudence in the form of directly applicable principles. Indeed, as theILO itself has pointed out on more than one occasion, Uruguay was and is stilltoday a unique case as regards the abstention of the State instandard-setting. This abstentionist policy, which has been defended andchampioned by the most prestigious national doctrine, has its raison d'tre inthe trade union resistance to all standard-setting by the State based on theideological origins of the movement and encouraged by the precociousdevelopment of a modern society which reaped the benefit of periods ofprosperity and well-being, and which enabled a labour relations system to bedeveloped which was respectful of trade union rights. In this context, theonly State measure of a general nature to guarantee the free exercise of thesetrade union rights was Decree No. / of  February  to facilitate theapplication of international standards in force and the sanctions establishedby national legislation which were regulated collectively and which expresslyprohibited anti-trade union practices. This quasi abstentionist system whichas regards the coming into force of Conventions Nos.  and  lasted almost
.The Government adds that shortly after the establishment of thedemocratic Government, Act No.  dated  March  marked an innovationin national practice when the so-called ""Acts"" Nos.  (on occupationalassociations),  and  (collective agreements),  (strikes), (trade union rights) and the so-called ""Basic Act"" No.  (strikes by publicofficials) - which had been brought into force by the de facto regime
.However, it is obvious - as the ILO itself has pointed out - thatalthough the state legislative abstention has proved particularly beneficialto trade union freedom, it does entail deficiencies",0,1987,Uruguay
95,"resulting from the lack ofstandards making express provision for adequate and effective machinery forthe special protection of trade union officials and activists againstdismissal and other acts of union discrimination. This lack of standardsexpressly guaranteeing effective methods of protection, to which attentioncould be drawn before the break-up of the country's institutions only at one'sown risk, posed a danger after the re-establishment of trade union freedomswhich, although not of a generalised nature, became a source of concern to theGovernment.

.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites theGoverning Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government, in the event that the proposedbill on trade union rights should be approved, to take the necessary measureswith a view to suppressing the requirement of obligatory voting in theelections of trade union officials as a condition of entitlement to thespecial trade union protection; the Committee emphasises the need to establishadequate, impartial and rapid procedures to ensure respect of the right toorganise which avoids any kind of anti-union discrimination.b) On the basis of the conclusions reached by the committee of inquiry setup by the Ministry of Labour, the Committee emphasises the need to remedy theanti-union acts and practices which have been occurring since , contraryto the provisions of Convention No. , and notes with interest that thetripartite arbitration commission set up to facilitate dialogue, negotiationand the self-regulation of conflicts in the clothing and leather industrieshas reached an agreement between the parties to negotiate a collectiveagreement to regulate relations, in particular as regards collectivebargaining. The Committee expresses the hope that this will lead in future tonegotiations carried out in good faith in which both the employers and thetrade unions will be able, in a climate of mutual confidence, to make thenecessary efforts to reach periodic collective agreements.
.The complaint is contained in communications dated  March and  May  from the Single National Trade Union of Workers in the Clothing and Allied Industries (SUA-VESTIMENTA), the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly and the National Workers' Convention (PIT-CNT). SUA-VESTIMENTA submitted new allegations in communications dated  August and  September . The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) supported the complaint in a communication dated  September . The Government sent certain observations in communications dated  and  October .
.In its communications the Government stated that it would be sending the report of a committee of inquiry set up to determine the truth of the allegations brought before the Committee on Freedom of Association. Nevertheless, the Government requested the Committee to examine the aspects of the complaint concerning the right to strike of public officials and state employees contained in the communication from the complainants of  May .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisations allege that Act No.  of  December , which in their opinion is unconstitutional, infringes the right to strike under section  by establishing that ""in the case of public services, including those administered by private individuals ... the Committee (at present the Ministry of Labour and Social Security) may indicate, after stating the grounds for its decision, ... those essential services which must be maintained in operation by emergency shifts and whose interruption would determine the unlawful nature of a strike""; the Act goes on to stipulate that ""in the case of interruptions in essential services, the public authority may take the necessary steps to maintain these services, including having recourse to the use of the equipment and the hiring of outside workers that are indispensable to maintain the services in operation, on the understanding that the relevant legal sanctions continue to be applicable to the staff concerned"". The complainants point out that the provision is so worded that all public services might be considered essential, in so far as the text neither",1,1987,Uruguay
97,"defines the type of activity concerned nor requires any justification for its being deemed to be essential.
.The complainant organisations add that under Act No. , and contrary to the principles of the ILO, the following have been declared as essential services: services carried out by the Social Security Directorate (Ministerial Resolution of ..); services carried out by the National Customs Directorate (Ministerial Resolution of ..); loading and unloading and similar activities (Ministerial Resolution of ..); and services carried out by the National Fuel, Alcohol and Portland Cement Administration (ANCAP) (Ministerial Resolution of ..).
.As regards the declaration of the services carried out by the Social Security Directorate as essential, the complainant organisations deny that these are essential in the strict sense of the term and point out that, apart from the fact that at the time the dispute had reached a point when agreement between the parties seemed highly unlikely, the Ministry of Labour's intention in consulting the PIT-CNT had been to reach consensus on its decision to declare the service essential. As to maintaining the health service in operation, the trade union organisations have their own procedure in the event of a dispute and organise shifts to keep the service going so as not to endanger the population. Similarly, as part of its contingency programme, the trade union organisation had provided for the payment of social security benefits. Furthermore, the Ministerial Resolution states that ""the running of essential services requires the functioning of other indispensable support services, and these are therefore likewise essential"". Thus, related services are also declared to be essential.
.The complainant organisations point out that, as regards social security, the Government's note calling for the consultation had already classified certain services as essential in advance. Despite this serious fault on the Government's part, the trade union organisation to which the workers concerned belong agreed to participate in the dialogue (..). The Government announced publicly that ""it would not enter into discussions with unofficial groups of workers"" and that ""it would not give in to their demands""; it also publicly refused mediation by the Committee on Labour Legislation of the Chamber of Deputies. The fact that the entire staff of the Raigon Holiday Camp, including  caretakers, nine administrators and  members of the personnel office, were listed as performing essential services shows clearly how the Government has deliberately misinterpreted and distorted the situation in the social security sector.
.The complainant organisations further state that, in the case of ANCAP, the staff on the boats servicing oil-tankers decking at the mooring buoy were listed as performing essential services, even though no tanker was due two months; even the painting of the mooring buoy was declared to be an essential service. ANCAP also attempted to oblige staff entering the factory to sign an undertaking not to resort to trade union action;  out of the  trade union officials were thus denied entry during the dispute. Thirty workers were arrested for having obeyed strike orders. Once the ANCAP dispute had ended, all kinds of discriminatory measures were taken against the strikers, including sanctions, legal proceedings and transfers. The army was called in to fight the strike and defend the Government's position. The complainants enclose copies of three decisions by the ANCAP Board dated  December , one penalising officials who took part in the dispute, a second expressing approval of those officials who had not taken part in the dispute, and a third approving the payment of overtime to these officials, and of a decision of  December  summoning all the officials who had taken part in the dispute and suspending those who did not come forward.
.The complainants conclude by stating that Act No.  is an attempt to regulate strikes by administrative orders, in other words to restrict a basic right and an essential public freedom by orders emanating from the public authority - which leaves both the individual citizen and the organisations that are entitled to strike without any defence. The only way to contest administrative orders stipulating the essential nature of services is through the ordinary appeals procedure, but this does not have the effect of suspending the order and is therefore useless as a defence; besides, the time-limits within which the State has to rule on an appeal are very broad, which far from offering any kind of a guarantee is purely and simply a denial of justice.
.The Government states that section  of Act No.  does not empower the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to ban public officials from striking but only to restrict its exercise by determining, if need be, which essential services must be maintained by emergency shifts. In the opinion of this Ministry, its restrictions concern essential services in the strict sense of the term (i.e. whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population), as well as those services which might, by extension, become essential because of the extent of the consequences of their interruption or because of the particular circumstances in each case, in so far as they would endanger the normal living conditions of the population. The Government develops a number of arguments to show that section  of Act No.  is constitutional. It observes that no action of the type provided for in the Constitution has been brought to have section  of the Act declared unconstitutional and that the complainants have not made use of the administrative and judicial appeals procedures provided for in Uruguayan legislation against the ministerial decisions imposing a minimum service in the four above-mentioned cases (payment of social security benefits, customs, port loading and unloading services, and fuel and alcohol supplies). The Government states that it agrees with the Committee's criteria with respect to the conditions for organising a minimum service and the participation of workers' organisations in these arrangements. The Government states that each time the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has had to make use of the power conferred upon it by the law to establish a minimum service, it has given orders (though in vain because the complainant organisations consider that it is the prerogative of the workers' organisations themselves to organise minimum services through their own procedures) for the workers' representatives to be convened in order to determine the essential services that have to be maintained by emergency shifts as long as the work stoppages last.
.With regard to the General Social Security Directorate (now known as the Social Welfare Bank), the Government states that, as an interruption in the payment of pensions and other social security benefits endangers the normal living conditions of a large sector of the population and its subsistence level, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security requested the Director-General of the Social Security Directorate on  May  to convene the workers' representatives to determine the services which should be maintained by emergency shifts to safeguard the payment of pensions and other social security benefits and health assistance. As the workers' representatives refused to take part, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security took a decision on  May , in accordance with the provisions of section  of Act No. , in which it declared the essential public services to be maintained by emergency shifts so as to guarantee the payment of old-age pensions, annuities, unemployment benefits and other cash benefits paid directly to the social security beneficiaries and to provide hospital services and medical care. The emergency shifts which, in view of the trade union organisation's refusal to co-operate, were decided upon unilaterally by the General Social Security Directorate, consisted of only , officials, a mere  per cent of the total staff. Furthermore, only minor disciplinary sanctions were imposed on officials who had refused to participate in the emergency shifts at the Directorate's administrative headquarters.
.As regards the National Customs Directorate, customs activities are an integral part of the State's financial police force, and as an essential responsibility of the State, can be directly exercised only by the State itself. The National Customs Directorate includes all the customs services throughout the country and its officials belong to a category of civil servants working for an administration with respect to which the Committee has acknowledged the possibility of a ban on strike action. Nevertheless, when the dispute caused by the National Customs Directorate officials arose, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, in the beginning, considered it inappropriate to ban the strike and decided to set up a minimum service to guarantee the dispatch of all perishable goods and raw materials, as well as manufactured goods, the lack or shortage of which would endanger the normal living conditions of the population. To this end and in accordance with the general conditions governing the application of section  of Act No. , established by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the workers' representatives were convened on  May  to determine the services to be maintained by emergency shifts. The Association",-1,1987,Uruguay
98,"of Customs Officials replied in a note of the same date that it was not its responsibility to define the concept of essential services in this case and that the matter should be determined by the legislative or constitutional bodies concerned. In the face of this refusal, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security made use of the powers conferred upon it by section  of Act No.  and stated, in a decision dated  May , that ""the processing of the usual formalities and documents concerning the import, export and transit of perishable goods, raw materials and manufactured or semi-manufactured goods, the lack or shortage of which might run the risk of causing a collective disaster for the society as a whole or endanger the life, personal safety and health of part or all of the population"" must be guaranteed as a minimum service. No sanctions were imposed during this dispute.
.As regards loading and unloading in ports, the Government points out that these services are provided by private workers registered with the labour exchange and that it is the responsibility of the National Docks Administration (ANSE) to administer and control these lists. The collective dispute which gave rise to the resolution cited in the present complaint and which resulted in the strike of the dockers brought all harbour services to a halt. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security bore in mind that the Committee on Freedom of Association has stressed on several occasions that in normal circumstances general dock work does not appear to be essential in the strict sense of the term in so far as its interruption would not endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population. However, it realised that, with the extension and duration of the strike, the total stoppage of dock work might bring about a crisis in which the normal living conditions of the population might be endangered. This was particularly the case for the export of perishable goods currently under way, as well as for the import and export of raw materials the lack or shortage of which might run the risk of causing a collective disaster for the society as a whole. In these circumstances, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security considered that it was lawful, in both cases, to set up a minimum service limited exclusively to the operations that were necessary for the normal living conditions of the population not to be endangered. It is for this reason that it convened the workers' organisations to decide upon the minimum services which should be guaranteed by emergency shifts. Given the refusal of the workers' representatives, who made the acceptance of their basic claims a condition for their participation, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, by a resolution of  June , decided that loading and unloading services and other directly related activities having to do with perishable goods, raw materials and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods the lack or shortage of which might run the risk of causing a collective disaster for all or part of the society and endanger the life, personal safety and health of the whole or part of the population, should be maintained in operation by emergency shifts. In fact, this resolution was not implemented because on the following day,  June , the dispute ended and an agreement was signed, with the participation of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security itself, stipulating that no sanctions would be imposed.
.As regards the services provided by the National Fuel, Alcohol and Portland Cement Administration (ANCAP), the Government states that Uruguay does not produce petroleum and that all its needs are met by importing crude oil which is refined within the country. All means of transport, with the sole exception of a small trolleybus service in the capital, depend upon an adequate supply of fuel. There are no electric railways and Uruguay does not produce any natural gas. Only a very small area of Montevideo has a mains gas system. In the other areas, the population uses propane gas. ANCAP, a state enterprise which plays a key role in the country's economy, holds the legal monopoly for importing and refining crude oil and petroleum by-products. This monopoly also extends to the import of all liquid, semi-liquid and gaseous fuels, whatever their state and composition. As a result, all fuels derived from petroleum used in the country are refined or imported by ANCAP. Private companies in Uruguay only distribute to the public the fuels imported or refined by ANCAP, which is the sole supplier. ANCAP also holds the legal monopoly for the import, manufacture and marketing of alcohols.
.According to the Government, when the ANCAP officials announced their dispute, the one and only petrol refinery in the country had already been out of operation for several days for technical reasons. This stoppage, which is necessary from time to time, had been planned in advance and the necessary amount of fuel had been stored so that supplies could be maintained during the interruption. Obviously, these supplies were limited by the available storage capacity and were intended to cover the normal duration of the technical operations to be carried out in the refinery. To begin with, the action taken by the officials involved in the dispute took the form of partial work stoppages which were so frequent that they interfered with the maintenance work that was under way in the refinery, which meant that the work in fact took longer. Thereupon, the mere announcement that the strike was to be officially declared brought about an artificial increase in demand that immediately provoked a crisis in the normal supply of fuel to the public. Had the situation continued, there was a danger that stocks might run out, especially since, as already pointed out, even the importation of refined petroleum products could only be carried out by ANCAP. It was therefore obvious, in these circumstances, that the interruption of services would create a crisis that was liable to endanger the normal living conditions of the population. It should also be stressed that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security had, quite normally and sufficiently in advance, advised the Board of the National Fuel, Alcohol and Portland Cement Administration (ANCAP) to convene the workers' organisation to discuss and draw up an agreement concerning the services to be maintained in the event of a dispute. This was done in September , whereupon the trade union organisation replied that it did not accept the interference of either the Government or the employers in deciding how it was to conduct its defence of the workers' interests and consequently would not discuss with the Board what services should be maintained during a dispute with the management, adding that the matter would be decided in each case at the assemblies of the organisation. As any hope of reaching an agreement on minimum services was thus out of the question, and in view of the announcement of more and more work stoppages by ANCAP officials, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, making use of the powers conferred upon it by section  of Act No. , decided which ANCAP services should be maintained in operation by emergency shifts. The latter affected a total of  officials, scarcely . per cent of the total number of workers. Furthermore, considering the complainant's allegations, it must not be forgotten that the officials assigned to emergency shifts who did not report for work were subjected only to disciplinary sanctions of a purely administrative nature; this took the form of a suspension of their duties, with a corresponding loss of remuneration, but at no time were those involved deprived of their freedom. The arrest of strikers referred to by the complainant occurred because they were intimidating distributors outside the workplace; only the strict minimum of arrests were made and the judicial authorities took immediate action.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organisation objects to the declaration of certain services as essential and the ensuing imposition of minimum services by resolutions of the Ministry of Labour issued in  under section  of Act No. , in connection with strike action taken by public officials and state employees in the National Social Security Directorate and the National Fuel, Alcohol and Portland Cement Administration and by dockers. In the complainant's view, section  of the Act is unconstitutional and empowers the Ministry to decide unilaterally that any public service is essential and therefore subject to minimum service requirements. The Committee notes that the Government argues that section  of Act No.  is constitutional and that the establishment of a minimum service under this Act in the sectors concerned was carried out in accordance with principles formulated by the Committee on Freedom of Association. The Government also stresses that the trade union organisations did not make use of the existing legal channels open for them to contest the Act or administrative resolutions.
.The Committee",-1,1987,Uruguay
99,"wishes to point out that it is not within its competence to pronounce on the constitutionality of the Act objected to by the complainant. However, in so far as it is applied in practice, the Committee must examine whether this Act and the administrative measures taken under it are in accordance with the principles of freedom of association. In this respect, the Committee, whilst noting the criteria for the application of the legislation in question that the Ministry of Labour claims to observe, feels bound to express its concern at the wording of section  of Act No. . The wording, as pointed out by the complainant organisation, can be applied to any public service which may then be required to provide a minimum service in the case of a strike; this is in open contradiction with the principles of the Committee concerning the nature of the services in which such a restriction is admissible. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that the establishment of minimum services in the case of strike action is legally possible only in services where the interruption might endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population or in services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term but where the extent and duration of a strike might be such as to result in an acute national crisis endangering the normal living conditions of the population.
.In the present case, as regards the minimum services established by administrative authority during strikes in the social security, customs, dock work and fuel supply sectors, the Committee wishes to recall the principles which it has repeatedly formulated on the matter and which must be seen as affording a minimum guarantee for the exercise of the right to strike, without prejudice to the possibility of individual national systems providing for a greater degree of protection of the exercise of the right to strike in their legislation and practice.
.On previous occasions, the Committee has considered it legitimate for a minimum service to be maintained in the event of a strike the extent and duration of which might be such as to result in an acute national crisis endangering the normal living conditions of the population. Similarly, the Committee has pointed out that, to be acceptable, the minimum service should be confined to operations that are strictly necessary to avoid endangering the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population and that, furthermore, the determination of minimum services should involve not only employers and the public authorities but also workers' organisations (see th Report, Case No.  (Spain), paras.  to ). This not only allows a careful exchange of viewpoints on what in a given situation can be considered as minimum services limited to the absolutely essential, but also contributes to guaranteeing that the scope of the minimum services does not result in the strike becoming ineffective in practice because of its limited impact and to dissipating possible impressions in the trade union organisations that a strike has come to nothing because of over-generous and unilaterally fixed minimum services (see th Report, Case No.  (Spain), para. ).
.In the Committee's opinion, the branches of activity in which the strikes referred to in the present case were declared fulfilled on the whole the requirements of the aforementioned principle concerning the acceptability of establishing minimum services. Nevertheless, upon reading the administrative resolutions impugned by the complainant organisation and taking into account the various aspects of the complaint to which the Government made no specific reply, concerning the actual extent of the minimum services (particularly in the social security sector - in which, for example, the entire staff of the Raigon Holiday Camp were allegedly affected - and in ANCAP where the painting of mooring buoys for oil-tankers was allegedly declared essential), the Committee does not exclude the possibility that excessive minimum services were established, even if this is somewhat attenuated by the fact that the trade union organisations, which considered that Act No.  was unconstitutional and claimed that it was their responsibility to provide the necessary minimum services during the dispute in accordance with their own procedure, did not accept the Ministry of Labour's proposal to take a joint decision on these minimum services. The Committee emphasises that in cases such as this a definitive ruling on whether the level of minimum services was indispensable or not - made in full possession of the facts - can be pronounced only by the judicial authorities, in so far as it depends, in particular, upon a thorough knowledge of the structure and functioning of the enterprises and establishments concerned and of the real impact of the strike action.
.The Committee expresses the hope that in the future matters relating to minimum services might be resolved through dialogue.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to amending section  of Act No.  in order to bring it into conformity with the above-mentioned principles relating to minimum services.b) The Committee expresses the hope that in the future matters relating to minimum services might be resolved through dialogue.c) The Committee requests the Government to send as soon as possible the report - which it announced it would send - of the committee of inquiry set up to determine the truth of the other allegations contained in the present complaint.",0,1987,Uruguay

.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Independent Labour Association of International Transport Workers dated  June . The Government replied in a communication dated  August .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges in its communication of  June  that four out of the five members of the provisional executive committee of the International Labour Association of International Transport Workers were dismissed. The complainant describes these dismissals as acts of anti-union discrimination and points out that they were effected when the management of the ""Nicols Gonzlez"" international cargo and freight transport undertaking learned that the meeting to set up the labour association had been held on  January .
.The Government states that it only has knowledge of the dismissal of three persons, who were those who applied through administrative channels for their reinstatement on the grounds of trade union immunity. The Government adds that on  May , at a conciliation meeting presided over by the Director of Labour Relations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the reinstatement of one of the dismissed persons was obtained, under the same conditions of employment and without loss of seniority in the undertaking. In the two remaining cases it was not possible to reconcile the parties since the undertaking argued that it was unaware of the trade union activity engaged in by the persons concerned and that they had been dismissed for strictly functional reasons. In spite of what the undertaking maintained, the administrative proceedings have not yet been exhausted but are continuing with the object of determining whether or not the termination of the employment relationship of the two workers was connected with the trade union activity in which they were engaged. Once the proceedings have been terminated the results will be communicated.
.With regard to the alleged anti-union dismissal of leaders of the Independent Labour Association of International Transport Workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, only three workers of the ""Nicols Gonzlez"" international cargo and freight transport undertaking applied through administrative channels to be reinstated on the basis of trade union immunity. The Committee notes also that one of the trade union leaders has been reinstated following a conciliation meeting presided over by the administrative authority.
.The Committee also notes that, with respect to the other two trade union leaders dismissed from the undertaking, the Government declares that administrative proceedings are continuing with a view to determining whether or not their dismissal was connected with the trade union activity in which they were engaged. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the results of the administrative proceedings regarding these dismissals.
.In general the Committee wishes to recall the great importance it attaches to the principle that no person should be dismissed or subject to other prejudicial measures regarding employment for carrying out legitimate trade union activities [see, for example, rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Chile), para. ].
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and in particular the following conclusions.(a) The Committee notes that one of the dismissed trade union leaders in the ""Nicols Gonzlez"" international cargo and freight transport undertaking has been reinstated following a conciliation meeting presided over by the administrative authority.(b) The committee requests the Government to communicate the result of the administrative proceedings under way regarding the dismissal from the said undertaking of the other two trade union leaders.(c) The Committee recalls in general the importance it attaches to the principle that no person should be dismissed or subject to other prejudicial measures regarding employment for carrying out legitimate trade union activities.",0,1984,Uruguay
103,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  April . The Government replied by a communication of  May .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April  the ICFTU alleges that Mr. Hugo de los Santos, leader of the ""Manos del Uruguay"" textile workers' union and a member of the executive committee of the textile workers' congress, was arrested with his wife in the early hours of  April  by members of the army; a hood was placed over his head and he was apparently taken to the th regiment. The ICFTU demands his release and assurances as to his physical safety.
.In its communication of  May  the Government states that the arrest of Mr. Hugo de los Santos was connected with the protest demonstration initially involving some  people on  April  in front of the textile undertaking ""Fibratex"", which was subsequently joined by workers' representatives from other firms, amounting altogether to some  people. Despite the improvised speeches made in front of the above-mentioned undertaking, and the fact that the demonstrators, carrying posters, then headed for the MUSA textile undertaking, the armed forces who are responsible for preserving law and order refrained from intervening and allowed the workers to demonstrate freely. However, when they saw that Mr. Hugo de los Santos Figueroa was part of the group and was acting as an agitator although he was then on probation, they reported the matter to the competent legal authorities who decided on his arrest on  April for a period of five days.
.Finally the Government states that it has no means of verifying the complainant's statement that Mr. de los Santos is a trade union leader of the workers' association of ""Manos del Uruguay"" and that it presumes this statement to be inaccurate since his name does not appear in the application of the said association to hold a constituent assembly nor has any official appointment been communicated to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
.The Committee observes that according to the Government's statements, the legally authorised detention of Mr. Hugo de los Santos for five days was due to his participation in an activity incompatible with the fact that he was then on probation to be precise, his participation as an agitator in a protest march of textile workers. The Committee observes that this march is said to have been of a peaceful nature since, as the Government recognises, the armed forces refrained from intervening.
.The Committee considers that the fact that a person is on probation should not mean that he is prohibited from taking part in lawful trade union activities such as a peaceful protest march. Since the Government has expressed doubts as to Mr. Hugo de log Santos' status as trade union leader, the Committee wishes to point out that the above principle applies not only to trade union leaders but also to trade unionists in general.
.In these circumstances the Committee regrets that Mr. Hugo de los Santos spent five days under arrest and draws the Government's attention to the principle stated above concerning the relationship between probation and the exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee considers that the fact that a person is on probation should not mean that he is prohibited from taking part in lawful trade union activities, such as a peaceful protest march.(b) Consequently the Committee regrets that Mr. Hugo de los Santos was held for five days for having taken part in a peaceful march and draws the Government's attention to the principle set forth above concerning the relationship between probation and the exercise of trade union rights.",0,1984,Uruguay
104,".On  August , the Government sent information on Cases Nos. , , , , ,  and  concerning allegations of infringements of freedom of association presented by numerous workers' organisations. Its communication contained details of the steps taken since the Government assumed power on  March  to halt the deterioration in the trade union situation in Uruguay and restore democracy.

It recalls that it sent a representative to the May  meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association to explain what was happening and that a government representative informed the Governing Body of the ILO that a democratic Uruguay had now returned to the Organisation which was aware of its responsibilities and prepared to respect its commitments.

.The Committee notes with satisfaction the information communicated by the Government on these cases and, specifically, the repeal of the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of several complaints, the revoking of the resolutions dissolving the National Workers' Convention (CNT) and the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT) and the resumption by these two organisations of their trade union activities in Uruguay.

.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Convention of Workers of Uruguay dated  January . This organisation sent additional information in communications dated  January and  April . The Government replied in communications dated  May and  August .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisation alleges in its communications of  and  January  that Mr. Daniel Martinez, a member of a workers' movement to obtain trade union rights in the state sector and, specifically, in the National Fuel, Alcohol and Portland Cement Administration (ANCAP), was notified at the end of October  that he was being laid off in accordance with Institutional Act No. . According to the complainant, Institutional Act No.  was used in this case, as in others, to persecute public servants engaged in trade union activities and to prevent a revival of trade union activity.
.The complainant states that Mr. Daniel Martinez, an industrial mechanical engineer by profession, joined ANCAP as a trainee on  September , continuing in this position until  December . He then became part of the permanent staff of ANCAP as an engineer in the Maintenance Department. In August  his supervisors proposed him for the post of Head of Workshops, but the proposal was vetoed by the senior management. Months later, as already mentioned, Institutional Act No.  was invoked for anti-union purposes.
.The complainant also alleges that workers' organisations in the teaching sector are intimidated and persecuted on account of their trade union activities; Ordinances Nos.  and  of the National Council of Education (parts of which the complainant cites) expressly prohibit union activities and provide for dismissal on trade union and ideological grounds.
.The complainant adds that in early January  three teachers at the ""Santa Mara"" secondary school, Jos Pedro Rilla, Juan Carlos Ottavianelli and Hugo Nilo Pintos (the first two of whom were members of the Provisional Committee of the Association of Workers of the General Institute of Marist Schools and the third a member of the Association), were dismissed. The headmaster of the school provided written certificates of the teachers' technical and teaching ability, but contended that their activities under Act No.  were against the school's educational policy.
.The complainant also mentions that in March  six professors of the Labour University of Uruguay (UTU) were not assigned teaching hours for the current year. Although these professors had temporary status, they had many years of service and their technical and teaching ability was recognised and documented. Since there were no reasons connected with their work, the explanation for this can only be the activities of the Civil Association of UTU staff. The same month another teacher, who was a member of the Executive Committee of the Association of Secondary School Teachers, was notified that his teaching hours; which had already been assigned to him in a single school, would be spread over six different schools, thus making it impossible for him to teach properly. The complainant also states that, for reasons unconnected with her work a woman secondary school teacher was not assigned teaching hours. Lastly, the complainant alleges that on  February  a mass meeting of teachers was held on the esplanade of the University of the Republic to demand respect for freedom of association and to protest against dismissals and trade union persecution. Members of the Coordinating Committee for the Teaching Profession were subsequently summoned to police headquarters to make statements.
.In its communication dated  May  the Government communicates a copy of the Resolution of the Board of ANCAP containing the decision to give notice to Mr. Daniel Martnez Villaamil, which reads as follows:
.The Government adds that it is untrue that Mr. Martnez Villaamil was ""laid off"", as the complainant claims; the Resolution to revoke his appointment could have been taken even without reference to section  of Constitutional Decree No. /, to which the complainant seems to attach such importance, since the principal legal basis for this decision was a frequently applied provision in the Staff Rules of ANCAP, namely article , which has been in force for ANCAP officials since .
.Moreover, continues the Government, it has no knowledge of Mr. Martnez Villaamil having engaged in any trade union activities that might expose him to supposed reprisals, nor does the complainant organisation give details of any such activities.
.Regarding the alleged dismissal of members of the Provisional Committee of the Association of Workers of the General Institute of Marist Schools, the Government states in its communication of  August  that, at the request of the interested parties, the Secretary of State for Labour investigated accusations of dismissals at the General Institute of Marist Schools and that the acting official conciliator formally established that compensation had been paid to the entire satisfaction of the workers involved. In none of the cases raised was there any infringement of trade union immunity inasmuch as the Association of Officials of the Santa Maria Secondary School had not been set up in accordance with Occupational Associations Act No. . The only trace of the Association was a request that was submitted on  September , since when, in spite of all the time that has passed, its bye-laws have not been submitted and no constituent assembly has been held. Consequently, there is not any provisional executive authority on whom the afore-mentioned Act and the decree made under it might have conferred the protection due to trade union leaders. Everything suggests that those who signed the request lost interest or were unable to obtain the support of the minimum number of  workers required by the law. Moreover, it would not seem reasonable to conclude that dismissals in  are the result of a mere request submitted two years earlier.
.As to the teachers who allegedly were not assigned teaching hours or had them spread among classes in different schools, the Government states that the allegations are too vague for it to be able to reply as the complainants have not provided sufficient details for the situations to be properly identified.
.With respect to Ordinances Nos.  and  of the National Council of Education (CONAE), the Government states that it is not true",0,1984,Uruguay
106,"that they prohibit union activities and provide for dismissal on trade union grounds, refers to a number of provisions which recognise the right of association of teachers and comments on various provisions of the said ordinances.
.The Committee notes that the allegations and the Government's reply respecting the termination of the employment relationship of Mr. Daniel Martnez Villaamil in the state undertaking ANCAP are contradictory. The complainant considers that it was an act of persecution in pursuance of Institutional Act No. , on account of trade union activities aimed at securing the exercise of trade union rights in the state sector. The Government states that it has no knowledge of Mr. Martnez Villaamil having engaged in any trade union activities that might expose him to supposed reprisals and points out that the complainant organisation has not given details of any such activities. The Government has transmitted the text of the decision of the Board of ANCAP to discharge Mr. Martnez Villaamil and has indicated that the principal legal basis for revoking his appointment was article  of the Staff Rules of ANCAP and that his dismissal could have been effected without reference to Institutional Act No. .
.The Committee also notes that the preamble to the Resolution of the Board of ANCAP pronouncing the dismissal of Mr. Martinez Villaamil states ""that it is not deemed appropriate or necessary to confirm the said official in the post to which he was appointed and that the Administration can dispense with his services without impairing the efficiency of his unit"".
.The Committee observes that both the Staff Rules of ANCAP and Institutional Act No.  (now repealed) contain provisions to the effect that all appointments of officials or employees are of a provisional nature for a period of one year, during which time the official or employee may be discharged without any reason being given. In this connection the Committee wishes to stress the importance it attaches to the need for legislation to provide for appropriate guarantees in order to ensure that the services of a public employee or official are not terminated on the grounds of his trade union office or activities.
.Regarding the dismissal of three members of the Association of Workers of the General Institute of Marist Schools - Mr. Rills, Mr. Ottavianelli and Mr. Nilo Pintos - the Committee notes the Government's statement and, in particular, its view that there has been no infringement of trade union immunity inasmuch as the Association has failed since  to fulfil the legal formalities required for its official constitution. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the precise grounds for the dismissal of the teachers so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts.
.As to the alleged acts of discrimination against certain teachers in the assignment of teaching hours, the Committee observes that the complainant has not supplied the names of the persons concerned and that the Government states that the allegations are too vague for it to be able to reply.
.With respect to the allegations concerning ordinances Nos.  and  of the National Council of Education, the Committee observes that the Government has replied on the subject. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the text of the said ordinances so that it can examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not answered the allegation that police headquarters summoned members of the Coordinating Committee for the Teaching Profession to make statements in connection with the mass meeting of teachers held on the esplanade of the University of the Republic on  February . The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) the Committee notes that both the Staff Rules of ANCAP and Institutional Act No.  (now repealed) contain provisions to the effect that all appointments of officials or employees are of a provisional nature for a period of one year, during which time the official or employee may be discharged without any reason being given. In this connection the Committee wishes to stress the importance it attaches to the need for legislation to provide for appropriate guarantees in order to ensure that the services of a public employee or official are not terminated on account of his trade union office or activities;(b) the Committee requests the Government to indicate the precise grounds for the dismissal of Mr. Rills, Mr. Ottavianelli and Mr. Nilo Pintos so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts;(c) the Committee requests the Government to communicate the text of Ordinances Nos.  and  of the National Council of Education so that it can examine the relevant allegations in full possession of the facts;(d) the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that police headquarters summoned members of the Coordinating Committee for the Teaching Profession to make statements in connection with the mass meeting of teachers held on the esplanade of the University of the Republic on  February  and requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.",1,1984,Uruguay
107,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Workers' Convention of Uruguay, dated  September . The Government replied in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that on  September , the police detained for several hours the trade union leaders Andrs Toriani (member of the Provisional Executive Committee of the Association of Officials of the Montevideo Workers' Catholic Circle and representative of this association at the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly - PIT) and Francisco Pecoche (member of the PIT). According to the complainant, these trade union leaders were arrested whilst distributing pamphlets announcing the trade union demonstration called by the PIT for  September in Montevideo; this demonstration consisted of observing ten minutes' silence at all workplaces to claim wage increases and the creation of new jobs.
.The complainant adds that the press conference called by the PIT for  September , to state the economic claims of workers belonging to the PIT, was stopped by order of the National Directorate of Information and Intelligence; the PIT was informed verbally of this order minutes before the conference was due to start.
.The complainant maintains that these occurrences form part of a continuous repressive policy against any type of protest that workers and the population make. For instance, in the last two months, , persons have been arrested, several dozens of whom havebeen tried and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment by the military courts. Furthermore, restrictive measures had been taken against the media by means of the Institutional Act No.  and an accompanying Decree, both dated  August . These provisions resulted in the seizing of four issues of the magazines ""Opinar"" and ""Aqu"", and in the ban imposed on the radio station ""CX  La Radio"" to continue broadcasting its programme ""Cartas a los Oyentes"" (letters to listeners). According to the complainant, the press censorship was aimed at preventing the general public from being informed about the activities and attitudes of the various social forces, as well as the position adopted by the workers and their claims.
.The Government states that Andrs Toriani and Francisco Pecoche were arrested for not having complied with the legal requirements in force concerning the distribution of publicity material. The Government points out that only Andrs Toriani held the position of trade union leader and that the authorities merely questioned those involved, who were then rapidly released.
.With respect to the press conference allegedly called by the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT), the Government states that it has not been informed of any third-level occupational association with the name of ""Inter-Union Workers' Assembly"" set up in accordance with the Act on professional associations and that the Ministry of the Interior had nothing whatsoever to do with the said press conference.
.Finally, the Government points out that the other allegations made by the complainant are not connected with freedom of association.
.With respect to the detention of two trade union leaders for several hours, the Committee notes that the Government denies that one of these persons was a trade union leader and states that they were arrested for not having complied with the legal requirements in force concerning the distribution of publicity material and that, once those concerned had been questioned by the authorities, they had rapidly been released. In this respect, the Committee notes that according to the complainant, the persons in question were arrested whilst distributing pamphlets announcing the trade union demonstration of  September , organised by the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly. In these circumstances, as the Government did not specify in which way the legal requirements in force concerning the distribution of publicity material had been violated, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade union leaders for legitimate trade union activities, even if this is only for questioning and for a short period of time, is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the allegation that the National Directorate of Information and Intelligence ordered the cancellation of a press conference called by the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly - PIT to explain the grounds for the trade union demonstration of  September , the Committee notes that the Government denies that the Ministry of the Interior had anything whatsoever to do with the said press conference. In view of this contradiction, the Committee insists upon the need for the Government to supply more detailed information on the matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) With respect to the arrest of two trade unionists whilst ' distributing pamphlets announcing the trade union demonstration of  September , the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade union leaders and trade unionists for legitimate trade union activities, even if this is only for questioning and for a short period of time, is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(b) The Committee requests the Government to supply more detailed information on the allegation that the National Directorate of Information and Intelligence ordered the cancellation of a press conference called by the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly.",0,1983,Uruguay
108,".When the Committee examined Case No.  at its February  meeting, it made the following recommendations concerning the allegations that were still pending.""The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Mr. Daniel Cocchi was dismissed for acts and omissions which undermined the trust which had been placed in this ship's captain. In order that it may examine this allegation in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to indicate specifically which concrete acts and omissions led to the dismissal of this trade union leader ...The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the APEEF was required to request administrative authorisations (from the Ministry of Labour and the Police) for its establishment.The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that Mr. Roberto Alfonso has been disqualified from acting as a trade union leader because of his 'ideological' views.""
.Regarding Case No. , the Committee observed that the Government had not replied to certain allegations and requested it to communicate its observations on the matter.
.The complainants alleged, inter alia, that the Ministry of the Interior and Social Security had not authorised the holding of definitive elections within the various labour associations that had been registered, with the result that they were still operating with provisional committees.
.The complainants also alleged that the Ministry of the Interior had prohibited Jos Custodio, Asdrbal Gadea, Nelson Curbelo and Julio Alonso, all members of the provisional committee of the Union of Manual Workers, Employees and Supervisors of FUNSA, from taking part in any trade union activities and had dismissed Roberto Mourio, Miguel Miraballes, Daniel Buscarons, Hugo Nicola, Doroteo Daz, Anselmo Oyarzbal, Enrique Larnaudie and Csar Martnez Yaquelo, militant members of the said trade union. It had also dismissed Daniela Amoroso, a member of the provisional committee of the Association of Employees of the Trade Development Bank for having protested against the dismissal of a union official. In addition, Carlos Larraya (Association of Officials of the Welfare Centre of the Medical Trade Union of Uruguay), Andrs Brun, Emeli Landriel and Julio Betervide (Association of Officials of the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay), Jos Curbelo, Milton Antognazza (Association of Employees of the Banco La Caja Obrera) [the Committee had already examined the allegation regarding the disqualification of Mr. Antognazza in connection with Case No.  (th Report, paras.  and )], Gonzalo Rodrguez (Association of Employees of the Banco de Crdito), Joaqun Pau (Association of Employees of the Banco Exterior de Espaa), Francisco Rama (Association of Employees of the Banco de Londres y Amrica del Sur), Daniel Gonzlez Mazzei and Roberto E. Miranda (Association of Employees of the Banco de Santander), Luis Becerra and Edgar Covagnaro (Association of Manual Workers and Employees of the Fbricas Nacionales de Cerveza) and Mario Carbajal (Association of Employees of the Banco Sudameris) had been disqualified from holding trade union office.
.Finally, the complainants stated that the Government had refused to recognise the representative nature of the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers of Uruguay.
.The Government states that the dismissal of Mr. Cocchi, ship's captain, as indicated in the judgment handed down by the Disciplinary Court of Misdemeanours of the Merchant Marine (the text of which the Government enclosed), was the result of his having given an arbitrary and unnecessary order which endangered a seaman's physical well-being and that he did so to satisfy a personal whim even though it meant needlessly exposing a worker to danger.
.The Government further states that, according to section , paragraph (b), of Act No.  on occupational associations, the statutes of such associations must specify their purpose and objective, which must relate to labour issues. Through the Register of Labour Associations, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security verifies compliance with this requirement; when a request is received to hold a meeting it accordingly examines the agenda, which is approved if it corresponds to the terms of the statutes. Once authorisation has been granted, the police headquarters are notified of the date and place of the meeting as required by current provisions on the matter, inasmuch as it is the police which is responsible for the maintenance of law and order. However, this requirement does not imply that there is any police intervention in the premises where the meetings are held.
.As to the alleged disqualification of Roberto Alfonso from acting as a trade union leader, the Government states that it does not possess sufficient information to identify the person concerned or the organisation to which he is said to belong.
.Regarding the alleged delaying of trade union elections, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour regularly organises elections to designate the permanent officials of registered occupational associations. Between January and May , ministerial resolutions were issued convening elections for the following associations Autonomous Bus Trade Union, Labour Association of Security Officers of the Port of Montevideo, Labour Association of Manual Workers and Employees of Facer Plast, Association of Appartment Janitors, Society of Drivers and Conductors United of ONDA S.A., Occupational Association of FUNSA Management Staff. These associations were previously operating with provisional officers elected by the workers at the time they were established.
.Regarding the alleged refusal of the authorities to recognise the representative nature of the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers of Uruguay (PIT) the Government states that the PIT never applied to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for registration, for recognition of its legal personality or for registration of its statutes and list of officials - all of which is in violation of Act No. . As to its activities as a de facto organisation, the Government observes that the PIT called a general strike on  January , among other things to demand the release of persons convicted by the courts of terrorist activities, and that it was for this reason that it was dissolved.
.Concerning the disqualification of certain union leaders from holding office,- the Government states that the persons referred to by the complainants were summonsed by police headquarters for failure to comply with section , paragraph (d), of Decree No. / containing regulations issued under Act No.  on occupational associations. All these persons notified the Registrar of Labour Associations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security of their resignation from the post of provisional official. With respect to the ban on holding trade union office provided for in section (d) of Decree No. /, the Government states that the provision is an elaboration of section (d) of the Act, whose wording was agreed to by the last direct contacts mission that the ILO sent to Uruguay. This provision does not permit union officials to be disqualified ""for trade union reasons""; the fact is that the organisations which at the time were declared unlawful by the public authorities were banned not for trade union reasons but for having joined political movements seeking to overthrow the Government by violent means. The records which the Director-General's representative examined on the occasion of the above-mentioned direct contacts mission showed clearly that the repressive action taken against certain persons who at the time were acting as union officials was adopted not in connection with trade union activities but on account of their active participation in terrorist movements. Similarly, the organisations were dissolved not for ""trade union reasons"" but in defence of national sovereignty and security. Accordingly, because they have been disqualified by virtue of the Constitution, the leaders of former organisations involved in terrorist activities are not eligible for election to trade union posts. Would any State, the Government asks, allow persons who have been involved in such activities to act as trade union officials?
.Concerning the alleged dismissals, the Government states that Roberto Mourio, Miguel Miraballes, Daniel Buscarons, Hugo Nicola, Doroteo Daz, Anselmo Oyarzbal, Enrique Larnaudie and Csar Martnez Yaquelo are not listed in the records kept by the Registrar of Labour Associations, which means that they are neither provisional officers of the Union of Manual Workers, Employees and Supervisors of FUNSA nor have they initiated proceedings to have the union established officially. When questioned on the subject, the undertaking confirmed that the persons referred to were merely employees and not union leaders and that they had been on unemployment insurance for a year and a half without being reinstated. Miss Daniela Amoroso, who has never been a member of the provisional committee of the Association of Employees of the Trade Development Bank, is in a similar situation.
.The Committee notes the findings of the Disciplinary Court of the Merchant Marine that union leader Daniel Cocchi, ship's captain, was dismissed for having given an arbitrary and unnecessary order which endangered a seaman's physical well-being.
.Regarding the allegation that the APEEF was required to request authorisations for its establishment, the Committee observes the Government's statement that, prior to the holding of any meeting, the responsible officials of the ministry of Labour and Social Security examine the agenda which they approve if it conforms to the requirements of section (d) of Act No.  on occupational",1,1983,Uruguay
109,"associations, which states that the statutes of such associations must specify their purpose and objective and that the latter must relate to labour issues. The Committee also observes that, once the agenda has been approved, the police headquarters are notified of the place and date of the meeting but that this does not imply that there is any police intervention in the place where the meetings are held.
.The Committee considers that the requirement that the agenda of the meeting to discuss the establishment of a trade union organisation should be submitted to the authorities for approval constitutes a considerable restriction on trade union independence and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the right to hold trade union meetings should not be subject to prior authorisation and that the authorities should refrain from any interference liable to restrict that right [see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. ].
.Regarding the alleged delay in holding definitive elections for the officials of occupational associations, the Committee notes that elections have already been convened by ministerial resolution in a number of occupational associations (of which the Government lists six). The Committee wishes to point out that the right of workers to elect their representatives freely should be exercised in accordance with the statutes of their occupational associations and should not be subject to the convening of elections by ministerial resolution since this constitutes interference by the authorities contrary to the principles contained in convention No. . The Committee regrets that, as a result of the interference of the authorities, most of the constituted organisations still have no permanent officers more than three years after the adoption of the new trade union legislation. The Committee requests the Government to take steps consistent with the above-mentioned principles so that all existing organisations can elect permanent officials as soon as possible.
.With respect to the disqualification of union leaders from holding office, the Committee notes that the Government recognises that, except for Roberto Alfonso, they were all summonsed by police headquarters for failure to comply with section (d) of Decree No. / containing regulations issued under the Act on occupational associations. The Committee also notes from the Government's statements that the persons disqualified from holding trade union' office under section (d) of the said Decree were leaders of former organisations which had been involved in terrorist activities. On this point the Committee recalls that, in its examination of Case No.  in its rd Report, it considered that section (d) of Decree No. / (requiring for election to trade union office that a person should not have held any executive post in organisations that have been declared unlawful) was contrary to the principles of Convention No.  and gave legal force to the possibility of disqualifying trade union leaders from carrying out their functions, even on trade union grounds - for example, for having held an executive post in a trade union organisation that has been declared unlawful.
.In the circumstances, noting that persons may be disqualified for having held executive posts in organisations that have been declared unlawful whether or not they have committed offences that constitute a genuine threat to the exercise of their trade union functions, the Committee requests the Government - as it did in its rd Report - to take the necessary steps to amend section (d) of Decree No.  and to quash the ruling whereby the persons referred to by the complainants were disqualified from holding trade union office.
.The Committee observes that the Government states in its reply that it does not have sufficient information to identify Roberto Alfonso or the organisation to which he belongs. In this connection the Committee refers the Government to the allegations of the World Confederation of Labour contained in its communication dated  June  [see rd Report, Case No. , para. ] which indicate that the organisation to which Roberto Alfonso belongs is the Association' of Navigating Personnel of the FRIPUR company and that he has been disqualified from holding trade union office on account of his ""ideological"" beliefs. In view of the time which has elapsed since the allegation was presented, the Committee cannot but repeat the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph.
.Concerning the alleged dismissals, the Committee observes that, according to the Government's communication of  May , the eight persons referred to by the complainants are not provisional officials of any labour association and have been on unemployment insurance for a year and a half without being reinstated. In this respect the Committee recalls that protection against acts of anti-union discrimination applies to all workers and not only trade union leaders. Consequently, the Committee must express its regret that the Government has not specified the reasons for their dismissal. In view of the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented, the Committee will limit itself to drawing the Government's attention to the fact that the dismissal of workers for engaging in trade union activities is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee will examine the allegation concerning the refusal of the Government to recognise the representative nature of the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers of Uruguay in the framework of Case No. .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee notes that the dismissal of union leader Daniel Cocchi, ship's captain, was the result of his having given an arbitrary and unnecessary order which endangered a seaman's physical well-being.(b) The Committee considers that the requirement that the agenda of a meeting to discuss the creation of a trade union organisation be submitted to the authorities for approval constitutes a considerable restriction on trade union independence and it draws the Government's attention to the fact that the right to hold union meetings should not be subject to prior authorisation and that the authorities should refrain from any interference liable to restrict that right.(c) As regard the alleged delay in holding definitive elections for the officials of occupational associations, the Committee wishes to point out that the right of workers to elect their representatives freely should be exercised in accordance with the statutes of their occupational associations and should not be subject to the convening of elections by ministerial resolution since this constitutes interference by the authorities contrary to the principles contained in Convention No. . The Committee regrets that, as a result of the interference of the authorities, most of the constituted organisations still have no permanent officers more than three years after the adoption of the new trade union legislation. The Committee requests the Government to take steps consistent with the above-mentioned principles so that all existing organisations can elect permanent officials as soon as possible.(d) Regarding the alleged disqualification of certain persons from holding trade union office, the Committee requests the Government to quash the ruling whereby the persons referred to by the complainants were disqualified and to take the necessary steps to amend section (d) of Decree No. / (requiring for election to trade union office that a person should not have held any executive post in organisations, including trade union organisations, that have been declared unlawful).(e) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the dismissal of workers for engaging in trade union activities is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) presented its complaint in a letter dated  June , with which it enclosed a communication signed by the trade union leaders Juan Pedro Ciganda and Richard Read on behalf of the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers of Uruguay. In a subsequent communication dated  November , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) associated itself with the allegations contained in the communication of the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers of Uruguay. The Government replied in communications dated  October and  November  and  February .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that trade union legislation in Uruguay - specifically, Act No.  of  May  respecting occupational associations and Decree No.  of  October  made there under and Act No.  of  October  respecting collective labour agreements and Decree No.  of  November  made there under - contain provisions that violate the ILO's Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.The complainants add that, despite the Government's previous assertions that public employees are entitled to join trade unions by virtue of the Public Employees Statute of , the Statute can hardly be said to recognise the right of association inasmuch as it contains no reference to the right of coalition, the right to strike or the possibility of concluding collective agreements governing the employment relationship. As far as the right to strike is concerned, the complainants state that, although article  of the",-1,1983,Uruguay
110,"Constitution contains a provision to that effect, it has in practice been denied, while the Government has merely announced that regulations are to be issued on the subject.
.The complainants further allege that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has not authorised the holding of definitive elections within the various labour associations that have been registered, with the result that they are still operating with provisional authorities.
.The complainants go on to state that the Ministry of the Interior has prohibited Jos Custodio, Asdrbal Gadea, Nelson Curbelo and Julio Alonso, all members of the provisional committee of the Union of Manual Workers, Employees and Supervisors of FUMSA, from taking part in any trade union activities and has dismissed Roberto Mourijo, Miguel Miraballes, Daniel Buscarons, Hugo Nicola, Doroteo Daz, Anselmo Oyarzbal, Enrique Larnaudie and Csar Martnez Yaquelo, militant members of the said trade union. It has also dismissed Daniela Amoroso, a member of the provisional committee of the Trade Development Bank, for having protested against the dismissal of a union official. In addition, Carlos Larraya (Association of Officials of the Welfare Centre of the Medical Trade Union of Uruguay), Andrs Brun, Emeli Landriel and Julio Betervide (Association of Officials of the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay), Jos Curbelo, Milton Antognazza. [The Committee has already examined the allegation regarding the disqualification of Mr. Antognazza in connection with Case No.  (see th Report, paras.  and ).] (Association of Employees of the Banco La Caja Obrera), Gonzalo Rodrguez (Association of Employees of the Banco de Credito), Joaqun Pau (Association of Employees of the Banco Exterior de Espaa), Francisco Rama (Association of Employees of the Banco de Londres y America del Sur), Daniel Gonzlez Mazzei and Roberto E. Miranda (Association of Employees of the Banco de Santander), Luis Becerra and Edgar Covagnaro (Association of Manual Workers and Employees of the Fbricas Nacionales de Cerveza) and Mario Carbajal (Association of Employees of the Banco SUDAMERIS) have been disqualified from holding trade union office.
.The complainants moreover state that the Government has not complied with its obligations under article , paragraphs (b) and (b), of the Constitution of the ILO, by failing to submit the Collective Bargaining Convention (No. ) and Recommendation (No. ) to the competent authorities. Finally, the WCL observes that the Government has refused to recognise the representative nature of the Inter-Union Plenary Workers of Uruguay. [The complainants have also submitted a number of allegations that have already been examined in connection with other cases (Cases Nos. ,  and ).]
.The Government states that, contrary to the allegation of the complainants, the executive authority submitted Convention No.  and Recommendation No.  to the Council of State in a message dated  May  in which it requested, for reasons which it explained, that the said Convention should not be approved. On  May , in accordance with article , paragraphs (c) and (c), of the Constitution of the ILO, it informed the ILO that the two instruments had been submitted to the Council of State and enclosed the text of the message from the executive authority, with the observation that copies of the message were being sent simultaneously to the recognised representative organisations in accordance with the requirements of article , paragraph  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.With regard to Act No.  of  May  and Decree No. / made there under, the Government states that the reports of the Committee on Freedom of Association and of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations both draw attention to the improvements introduced into the Occupational Associations Act by comparison with the draft texts on which the ILO had been invited to submit its comments. The Government also refers to the Committee on Freedom of Association's recommendation concerning Case No.  (paragraph ) in its th Report, which the Governing Body approved at its th Session (March ), to the effect that: ""(a) as regards the allegation concerning the Occupational Associations Act, the Committee, having already examined this Act at its May  Session and having reached its conclusions on the substance of the matter, considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination on its part.""
.Referring to the provisions of Decree No. , the Government states that this Decree recognises as possible bargaining agents in the collective bargaining system both trade unions and staff delegates elected by secret vote (sections  and ). The Government considers that this is in conformity with the ILO's principles concerning collective bargaining since the collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) accepts recourse to such representatives in so far as this does not undermine the position of the workers' organisations.
.The Government states further that Act No.  and Decree No.  do not prohibit collective bargaining at the federation and confederation level, but merely regulate this activity at the level of the undertaking. According to the Government, it is not unlikely that, once organisations start being formed at the higher level, the possibility of extending the regulation of collective bargaining to the higher levels will be studied.
.As regards the necessity of having collective agreements approved by an absolute majority of the employees concerned (sections (b) of the Act and (b) of the Decree), the Government states that this is not a sign of distrust but rather guarantees an endorsement from the workers of the agreement. It must not be forgotten that a collective agreement applies to all members of the negotiating unit - including non-union workers who could have signed it - and those workers who oppose it.
.The Government adds that the control exercised by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security over collective agreements (sections (a) of the Act and (a) of the Decree) is only a formal control of legality. Its only aim is to verify that the standards accorded in the agreement do not establish levels of protection inferior to those laid down by law. It is not a verification of acceptability in the light of the Government's economic policy. Lastly, the Government states that since  November  the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has registered  collective agreements which fall exactly within the Article  of Convention No. 's ""promotion obligation"".
.The Committee observes that the allegations refer, on the one hand, to trade union legislation and, on the other, to dismissals on anti-union grounds, disqualification from holding trade union office and non-recognition of the representative nature of a trade union organisation.
.With regard to the trade union legislation, the Committee observes that it has already had occasion to examine and express its opinion on Act No.  respecting occupational associations. The Committee therefore draws attention to the comments on the Act contained in its th Report (May ), [see th Report, paragraphs  to ] as they apply equally to the provisions of Decree No.  made there under which reproduces provisions of the Act to which the Committee had objected. The Committee observes, however, that Decree No.  has introduced a number of new provisions under the Occupational Associations Act that are contrary to the principles of Convention No. : specifically, the requirement for election to trade union office that a person should not have held any executive post in organisations that have been declared unlawful and should have not have been disqualified by virtue of the Constitution (sections (d) and (e)), the requirement that a period of time elapse before the members of the executive body of an association can be re-elected (section ), and the rules governing the affiliation to second- and third-level occupational organisations or to international organisations and the election and composition of the administrative bodies of second- and third-level organisations (sections  to ).
.The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that these provisions imply an excessive restriction of trade union rights, in particular, the right of workers to elect their representatives freely. In addition, the Committee wishes to emphasise that sections (d) and (e) of Decree No.  give legal force to the possibility of disqualifying trade union leaders from carrying out their functions, even on trade union grounds - for example, for having held an executive post in a trade union organisation that has been declared unlawful.
.With regard to Act No.  of  October  respecting collective labour agreements and Decree No.  of  November  made there under, the Committee observes that according to the Government, the provisions relating to the control of collective agreements by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (sections (a) of the Act and (a) of the Decree) set out a simple formal control as to legality (checking whether the standards in the agreement do not establish levels of protection inferior to those laid down by law).
.The Committee also notes that, in relation to the above-mentioned Act and Decree, the Government states that it is not unlikely that, once organisations start being formed at higher levels, the possibility of extending the regulation of collective bargaining",-1,1983,Uruguay
111,"to federations and confederations will be studied. The Committee takes note of the Government's 'statement that the approval of collective agreements by a majority of workers (sections (b) of the Act and (b) of the Decree) is not a sign of distrust, but rather so as to ensure the endorsement by the workers of the agreement. Finally, the Committee notes that the Government refers to Article , paragraph  of Convention No.  to justify the compatibility of sections  and  of the Decree (possibility of both trade unions and staff delegates to conclude collective agreements independently within the same undertaking) with international labour standards.
.The Committee wishes to point out that federations and confederations should be able to conclude collective agreements and that the possibility for staff delegates who represent  per cent of the workers to conclude collective agreements with an employer (sections  and  of the Decree) even where one or more labour associations already exist is not conducive to the development of collective bargaining in the sense of Article  of Convention No. , i.e. ""between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations""; in addition, in view of the small percentage required, this possibility could undermine the position of the workers' organisations contrary to Article , paragraph  of Convention No. . The Committee also considers that, in so far as the persons who conclude the collective agreements are trade union representatives, the requirement that they be approved by an absolute majority of the workers involved (sections (b) of the Act and (b) of the Decree may constitute an obstacle to collective bargaining which is incompatible with Article  of the Convention.
.The Committee further observes that, in so far as Act No.  concerning occupational associations and the Decree made there under virtually prohibit the establishment of first-level organisations by branch of activity and considering that federations and confederations are not allowed to conclude collective agreements, there is in practice no possibility of concluding collective agreements outside the undertaking - and, specifically, at the level of the branch of activity - and that this constitutes a major restriction on the trade union rights of workers and their organisations which is contrary to the principles of collective bargaining.
.The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the provisions of the law that are contrary to Conventions Nos.  and  in the light of the principles outlined above.
.With regard to the exercise of the right to strike and the trade union rights of public employees and officials, the Committee observes that the Government informed the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations that the national authorities were studying the preliminary draft of a set of provisions governing the exercise of the right to strike and that the National Security Council had recommended that the executive authority revise and adapt the legislation relating to public officials and issue regulations governing their right of association. The Committee expresses its concern at the continued existence of differences for many years between the law and the principles of freedom of association and wishes to emphasise the importance which it attaches to these matters being settled as soon as possible. It expresses the hope that future legislation will be fully in conformity with the principles of freedom of association and asks the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this respect. It draws the legislative aspects of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations that the authorities have not yet authorised the holding of definitive elections for the officials of the labour associations or to the allegations concerning dismissals on trade union grounds, the disqualification of certain persons from holding trade union office and the refusal of the authorities to recognise the representative nature of the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers of Uruguay. The Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations on these allegations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee observes that Decree No.  made under the occupational Associations Act, Act No.  respecting collective work agreements and Decree No.  made there under contain provisions that are not in conformity with the Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the provisions of the legislation that are contrary to Conventions Nos.  and , in the light of the principles outlined above.(c) The Committee expresses its concern at the continued existence of differences for many years between the legislation and the principles of freedom of association with respect to the exercise of the right to strike and the trade union rights of public employees and officials, and emphasises the importance which it' attaches to these matters being settled as soon as possible. It expresses the hope that future legislation on the subject will be fully in conformity with the principles of freedom of association and asks the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this respect.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations that the authorities have not yet authorised the'' holding of definitive elections for the officials of the labour associations and on the allegations concerning dismissals on' trade union grounds, the disqualification of certain persons from holding trade union office and the refusal of the authorities to recognise the representative nature of the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers of Uruguay.(e) The Committee draws the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",0,1983,Uruguay
112,".When the Committee examined Case No.  at its February  meeting, it made the following recommendations concerning the allegations that were still pending.""The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Mr. Daniel Cocchi was dismissed for acts and omissions which undermined the trust which had been placed in this ship's captain. In order that it may examine this allegation in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to indicate specifically which concrete acts and omissions led to the dismissal of this trade union leader ...The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the APEEF was required to request administrative authorisations (from the Ministry of Labour and the Police) for its establishment.The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that Mr. Roberto Alfonso has been disqualified from acting as a trade union leader because of his 'ideological' views.""
.Regarding Case No. , the Committee observed that the Government had not replied to certain allegations and requested it to communicate its observations on the matter.
.The complainants alleged, inter alia, that the Ministry of the Interior and Social Security had not authorised the holding of definitive elections within the various labour associations that had been registered, with the result that they were still operating with provisional committees.
.The complainants also alleged that the Ministry of the Interior had prohibited Jos Custodio, Asdrbal Gadea, Nelson Curbelo and Julio Alonso, all members of the provisional committee of the Union of Manual Workers, Employees and Supervisors of FUNSA, from taking part in any trade union activities and had dismissed Roberto Mourio, Miguel Miraballes, Daniel Buscarons, Hugo Nicola, Doroteo Daz, Anselmo Oyarzbal, Enrique Larnaudie and Csar Martnez Yaquelo, militant members of the said trade union. It had also dismissed Daniela Amoroso, a member of the provisional committee of the Association of Employees of the Trade Development Bank for having protested against the dismissal of a union official. In addition, Carlos Larraya (Association of Officials of the Welfare Centre of the Medical Trade Union of Uruguay), Andrs Brun, Emeli Landriel and Julio Betervide (Association of Officials of the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay), Jos Curbelo, Milton Antognazza (Association of Employees of the Banco La Caja Obrera) [the Committee had already examined the allegation regarding the disqualification of Mr. Antognazza in connection with Case No.  (th Report, paras.  and )], Gonzalo Rodrguez (Association of Employees of the Banco de Crdito), Joaqun Pau (Association of Employees of the Banco Exterior de Espaa), Francisco Rama (Association of Employees of the Banco de Londres y Amrica del Sur), Daniel Gonzlez Mazzei and Roberto E. Miranda (Association of Employees of the Banco de Santander), Luis Becerra and Edgar Covagnaro (Association of Manual Workers and Employees of the Fbricas Nacionales de Cerveza) and Mario Carbajal (Association of Employees of the Banco Sudameris) had been disqualified from holding trade union office.
.Finally, the complainants stated that the Government had refused to recognise the representative nature of the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers of Uruguay.
.The Government states that the dismissal of Mr. Cocchi, ship's captain, as indicated in the judgment handed down by the Disciplinary Court of Misdemeanours of the Merchant Marine (the text of which the Government enclosed), was the result of his having given an arbitrary and unnecessary order which endangered a seaman's physical well-being and that he did so to satisfy a personal whim even though it meant needlessly exposing a worker to danger.
.The Government further states that, according to section , paragraph (b), of Act No.  on occupational associations, the statutes of such associations must specify their purpose and objective, which must relate to labour issues. Through the Register of Labour Associations, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security verifies compliance with this requirement; when a request is received to hold a meeting it accordingly examines the agenda, which is approved if it corresponds to the terms of the statutes. Once authorisation has been granted, the police headquarters are notified of the date and place of the meeting as required by current provisions on the matter, inasmuch as it is the police which is responsible for the maintenance of law and order. However, this requirement does not imply that there is any police intervention in the premises where the meetings are held.
.As to the alleged disqualification of Roberto Alfonso from acting as a trade union leader, the Government states that it does not possess sufficient information to identify the person concerned or the organisation to which he is said to belong.
.Regarding the alleged delaying of trade union elections, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour regularly organises elections to designate the permanent officials of registered occupational associations. Between January and May , ministerial resolutions were issued convening elections for the following associations Autonomous Bus Trade Union, Labour Association of Security Officers of the Port of Montevideo, Labour Association of Manual Workers and Employees of Facer Plast, Association of Appartment Janitors, Society of Drivers and Conductors United of ONDA S.A., Occupational Association of FUNSA Management Staff. These associations were previously operating with provisional officers elected by the workers at the time they were established.
.Regarding the alleged refusal of the authorities to recognise the representative nature of the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers of Uruguay (PIT) the Government states that the PIT never applied to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for registration, for recognition of its legal personality or for registration of its statutes and list of officials - all of which is in violation of Act No. . As to its activities as a de facto organisation, the Government observes that the PIT called a general strike on  January , among other things to demand the release of persons convicted by the courts of terrorist activities, and that it was for this reason that it was dissolved.
.Concerning the disqualification of certain union leaders from holding office,- the Government states that the persons referred to by the complainants were summonsed by police headquarters for failure to comply with section , paragraph (d), of Decree No. / containing regulations issued under Act No.  on occupational associations. All these persons notified the Registrar of Labour Associations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security of their resignation from the post of provisional official. With respect to the ban on holding trade union office provided for in section (d) of Decree No. /, the Government states that the provision is an elaboration of section (d) of the Act, whose wording was agreed to by the last direct contacts mission that the ILO sent to Uruguay. This provision does not permit union officials to be disqualified ""for trade union reasons""; the fact is that the organisations which at the time were declared unlawful by the public authorities were banned not for trade union reasons but for having joined political movements seeking to overthrow the Government by violent means. The records which the Director-General's representative examined on the occasion of the above-mentioned direct contacts mission showed clearly that the repressive action taken against certain persons who at the time were acting as union officials was adopted not in connection with trade union activities but on account of their active participation in terrorist movements. Similarly, the organisations were dissolved not for ""trade union reasons"" but in defence of national sovereignty and security. Accordingly, because they have been disqualified by virtue of the Constitution, the leaders of former organisations involved in terrorist activities are not eligible for election to trade union posts. Would any State, the Government asks, allow persons who have been involved in such activities to act as trade union officials?
.Concerning the alleged dismissals, the Government states that Roberto Mourio, Miguel Miraballes, Daniel Buscarons, Hugo Nicola, Doroteo Daz, Anselmo Oyarzbal, Enrique Larnaudie and Csar Martnez Yaquelo are not listed in the records kept by the Registrar of Labour Associations, which means that they are neither provisional officers of the Union of Manual Workers, Employees and Supervisors of FUNSA nor have they initiated proceedings to have the union established officially. When questioned on the subject, the undertaking confirmed that the persons referred to were merely employees and not union leaders and that they had been on unemployment insurance for a year and a half without being reinstated. Miss Daniela Amoroso, who has never been a member of the provisional committee of the Association of Employees of the Trade Development Bank, is in a similar situation.
.The Committee notes the findings of the Disciplinary Court of the Merchant Marine that union leader Daniel Cocchi, ship's captain, was dismissed for having given an arbitrary and unnecessary order which endangered a seaman's physical well-being.
.Regarding the allegation that the APEEF was required to request authorisations for its establishment, the Committee observes the Government's statement that, prior to the holding of any meeting, the responsible officials of the ministry of Labour and Social Security examine the agenda which they approve if it conforms to the requirements of section (d) of Act No.  on occupational",1,1983,Uruguay
113,"associations, which states that the statutes of such associations must specify their purpose and objective and that the latter must relate to labour issues. The Committee also observes that, once the agenda has been approved, the police headquarters are notified of the place and date of the meeting but that this does not imply that there is any police intervention in the place where the meetings are held.
.The Committee considers that the requirement that the agenda of the meeting to discuss the establishment of a trade union organisation should be submitted to the authorities for approval constitutes a considerable restriction on trade union independence and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the right to hold trade union meetings should not be subject to prior authorisation and that the authorities should refrain from any interference liable to restrict that right [see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. ].
.Regarding the alleged delay in holding definitive elections for the officials of occupational associations, the Committee notes that elections have already been convened by ministerial resolution in a number of occupational associations (of which the Government lists six). The Committee wishes to point out that the right of workers to elect their representatives freely should be exercised in accordance with the statutes of their occupational associations and should not be subject to the convening of elections by ministerial resolution since this constitutes interference by the authorities contrary to the principles contained in convention No. . The Committee regrets that, as a result of the interference of the authorities, most of the constituted organisations still have no permanent officers more than three years after the adoption of the new trade union legislation. The Committee requests the Government to take steps consistent with the above-mentioned principles so that all existing organisations can elect permanent officials as soon as possible.
.With respect to the disqualification of union leaders from holding office, the Committee notes that the Government recognises that, except for Roberto Alfonso, they were all summonsed by police headquarters for failure to comply with section (d) of Decree No. / containing regulations issued under the Act on occupational associations. The Committee also notes from the Government's statements that the persons disqualified from holding trade union' office under section (d) of the said Decree were leaders of former organisations which had been involved in terrorist activities. On this point the Committee recalls that, in its examination of Case No.  in its rd Report, it considered that section (d) of Decree No. / (requiring for election to trade union office that a person should not have held any executive post in organisations that have been declared unlawful) was contrary to the principles of Convention No.  and gave legal force to the possibility of disqualifying trade union leaders from carrying out their functions, even on trade union grounds - for example, for having held an executive post in a trade union organisation that has been declared unlawful.
.In the circumstances, noting that persons may be disqualified for having held executive posts in organisations that have been declared unlawful whether or not they have committed offences that constitute a genuine threat to the exercise of their trade union functions, the Committee requests the Government - as it did in its rd Report - to take the necessary steps to amend section (d) of Decree No.  and to quash the ruling whereby the persons referred to by the complainants were disqualified from holding trade union office.
.The Committee observes that the Government states in its reply that it does not have sufficient information to identify Roberto Alfonso or the organisation to which he belongs. In this connection the Committee refers the Government to the allegations of the World Confederation of Labour contained in its communication dated  June  [see rd Report, Case No. , para. ] which indicate that the organisation to which Roberto Alfonso belongs is the Association' of Navigating Personnel of the FRIPUR company and that he has been disqualified from holding trade union office on account of his ""ideological"" beliefs. In view of the time which has elapsed since the allegation was presented, the Committee cannot but repeat the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph.
.Concerning the alleged dismissals, the Committee observes that, according to the Government's communication of  May , the eight persons referred to by the complainants are not provisional officials of any labour association and have been on unemployment insurance for a year and a half without being reinstated. In this respect the Committee recalls that protection against acts of anti-union discrimination applies to all workers and not only trade union leaders. Consequently, the Committee must express its regret that the Government has not specified the reasons for their dismissal. In view of the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented, the Committee will limit itself to drawing the Government's attention to the fact that the dismissal of workers for engaging in trade union activities is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee will examine the allegation concerning the refusal of the Government to recognise the representative nature of the Inter-Union Plenary of Workers of Uruguay in the framework of Case No. .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee notes that the dismissal of union leader Daniel Cocchi, ship's captain, was the result of his having given an arbitrary and unnecessary order which endangered a seaman's physical well-being.(b) The Committee considers that the requirement that the agenda of a meeting to discuss the creation of a trade union organisation be submitted to the authorities for approval constitutes a considerable restriction on trade union independence and it draws the Government's attention to the fact that the right to hold union meetings should not be subject to prior authorisation and that the authorities should refrain from any interference liable to restrict that right.(c) As regard the alleged delay in holding definitive elections for the officials of occupational associations, the Committee wishes to point out that the right of workers to elect their representatives freely should be exercised in accordance with the statutes of their occupational associations and should not be subject to the convening of elections by ministerial resolution since this constitutes interference by the authorities contrary to the principles contained in Convention No. . The Committee regrets that, as a result of the interference of the authorities, most of the constituted organisations still have no permanent officers more than three years after the adoption of the new trade union legislation. The Committee requests the Government to take steps consistent with the above-mentioned principles so that all existing organisations can elect permanent officials as soon as possible.(d) Regarding the alleged disqualification of certain persons from holding trade union office, the Committee requests the Government to quash the ruling whereby the persons referred to by the complainants were disqualified and to take the necessary steps to amend section (d) of Decree No. / (requiring for election to trade union office that a person should not have held any executive post in organisations, including trade union organisations, that have been declared unlawful).(e) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the dismissal of workers for engaging in trade union activities is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) dated  June . The Government replied in communications dated  October and  November .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that on  November  the undertaking ""Frigorfico Pesquero del Uruguay (FRIPUR) S.C."" (Uruguay Fishing and Freezing Company) unilaterally decided to amend the wage system applicable to fishermen (who are paid a percentage of the value of the tonnage of the catch) by changing the value of the tonnage of the catch from  dollars to , new pesos, and thus reducing wages by more than  per cent. Some months later, after discussion with the management of the undertaking, the reduction in wages was set at  per cent with regard to the level prior to November .
.As a result of this situation and a series of irregularities in the undertaking concerning contracts and the payment of wages, the workers of FRIPUR decided to establish an occupational association. According to the complainant, in order to set up this occupational association, the workers were required to request authorisation from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security as well as from the police headquarters, which refused the request on the grounds that the signatory, Mr. Roberto Alfonso, had espoused ideological beliefs which disqualified him from becoming a trade union leader and of which he himself was unaware. For this reason the workers were required to request new authorisations.
.The complainant continues that the constituent",-1,1983,Uruguay
114,"general meeting was held on  January  and that the new association was registered with the Ministry of Labour on  March. A letter of presentation was sent to the undertaking and to the Director of the Merchant marine giving the names of the elected leaders and referring to the need to draw up a work contract in accordance with the provisions of ILO Convention No. , ratified by Uruguay on  April  by Act No. . According to the complainant, on  March , two of the trade union leaders who signed the above-mentioned letter of presentation (Messrs. Fredy Serpa and Oscar Leal) were dismissed; the third signatory had been at sea since  March and thus could not be dismissed.
.The complainant points out that after a complaint had been lodged with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on the same day, the latter ordered the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed; the undertaking challenged the legality of the association set up since it claimed that the fishermen were partners in production and therefore could not become trade union members. The undertaking decided to reinstate Mr. Oscar Leal from  March and informed him that ranking staff (captains and engineers) would not be permitted to join the association.
.As regards Mr. Fredy Serpa (engineer) the complainant points out that his status as a worker in the undertaking was called into question on  January  (date of the constituent general meeting of the association) and  March  (registration of the association) since his name did not appear on the work roster. Because of this irregularity, the association produced a certificate of his period of work during the previous year and showed that he was on the dates in question on leave of absence and compensatory leave for work carried out during , as well as the captain's statement certifying the allegation of the association.
.The complainant alleges furthermore that on  April , after a prejudicial campaign had been waged against him, Mr. Daniel Cocchi, leader of the association, and captain of the vessel in which Mr. Serpa was sailing, and who had confirmed the leave of the latter, was himself dismissed.
.The complainant also alleges that although Act No.  of  respecting occupational associations stipulates that the elections of permanent authorities must be held  days after the registration of associations, this is impossible since neither the Ministry of Labour nor the electoral college have established the form in which such elections should be held. Finally, the complainant alleges that the right to strike was regulated by Decree No. / in such a way that it cannot be exercised without being classified as illegal. [The Committee will study the allegations contained in this paragraph in its examination of Case No.].]
.The Government states that although it is true that some workers of the undertaking Frigorfico Pesquero del Uruguay (FRIPUR) S.C. completed all the administrative steps required for the establishment of a workers' association (presentation of the list of officers provisionally appointed and the statutes) the affirmation concerning the registration of the association is incorrect and thus, since the latter is devoid of legal personality, the officers provisionally appointed enjoy powers of representation only for the purposes of completing the necessary steps to set up the association.
.The Government also states that, at the request of one of the parties concerned, the Secretariat of State for Labour acted as mediator in the matter regarding the dismissal of Messrs. Fredy Serpa, Oscal Leal and Daniel Cocchi and that the first of these has been working normally since  October .
.With regard to the dismissal of Mr. Cocchi, captain of one of the FRIPUR vessels, the undertaking decided not to extend his employment beyond  April  for acts and omissions which in its view undermined the trust upon which the working relationship was based and decided in principle that the representation of the shipowner vis--vis the workers would be assumed on board by the captain. Independently, the request presented by the shipowner of the fishing vessel ""Marina Rajamar"", regarding the revision of the rating awarded to the captain of the said vessel, Mr. Daniel Cocchi, was submitted to the Disciplinary Court of the Registry Office of the Merchant Marine, which is responsible to the National Naval Prefecture. At the conclusion of its proceedings, the above-mentioned court advised the Registrar and the Director of the Merchant Marine to reconsider the rating awarded to captain Cocchi and to reduce it to ""passable"" for service and conduct; to withdraw the service book for a period of six months for the infringement of various regulations governing service on board vessels and disciplinary regulations; and to establish that there was just cause for dismissal.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Leal, the Government points out that during the administrative proceedings only the certificate of disembarkation was requested from the undertaking, and that the shipowner undertook to implement the provisions in force. The Government adds that the Disciplinary Court of the Registry Office of the Merchant Marine, after having been informed that the owner of the fishing vessel ""Laura Adriana"" had discharged the above-mentioned engineer on  July , recommended, after the conclusion of the appropriate proceedings, that the discharge and the rating recorded in the service book of Mr. Leal should be maintained and, in accordance with the regulations governing the conduct of crews on vessels of the merchant marine, that it should be established that there was just cause for dismissal.
.The Government encloses a copy of the various administrative decisions concerning the alleged dismissals.
.In the present case the complainant has alleged the dismissal of three trade union leaders of the Association of Ships' Crews of the undertaking FRIPUR (APEEF), Messrs. Fredy Serpa, Oscar Leal and Daniel Cocchi. The first two were allegedly dismissed on  March , five days after APEEF informed the undertaking of the names of the trade union leaders elected by the constituent general meeting of this association; the third was allegedly dismissed for having supported the reinstatement of Mr. Serpa. The complainant also alleges that in order to set up the association APEEF, the workers of FRIPUR had to request an authorisation from the Ministry of Labour and another from the police headquarters, which was refused because one of the signatories (Mr. Roberto Alfonso) had espoused ideological views which disqualified him from becoming a trade union leader, and thus the workers had to request new authorisations.
.The Committee takes note of the statements of the Government on the alleged dismissals. The Committee notes in particular that according to the Government Mr. Fredy Serpa has been working normally since  October .
.The Committee also observes that according to the complainant, Mr. Oscar Leal returned to the undertaking on  March  (ten days after his dismissal). However, from the documentation sent by the Government, it appears that Mr. Oscar Leal was discharged (and therefore dismissed) from the fishing boat ""Laura Adriana"" on  July  and that when the undertaking FRIPUR and Mr. Leal appeared before the administrative authorities, Mr. Leal did not request his reinstatement. For this reason the Committee considers that it would not be appropriate to proceed with its examination of this allegation.
.However, given that the trade union leader Fredy Serpa remained dismissed between  March and  October  and that the Government has not denied that Mr. Leal was dismissed initially on  March  although he was reinstated ten days later, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that the dismissal of trade union leaders by reason of union membership or activities is contrary to Article  of Convention No. . In addition, it points out that such dismissals could amount to intimidation aimed at preventing the free exercise of their trade union functions.
.As regards the dismissal of the trade union leader Mr. Daniel Cocchi, the Committee notes that, according, to the Government, he was dismissed on  April  for acts and omissions which undermined the trust placed in this ship's captain. The Committee requests the Government to indicate specifically which concrete acts and omissions led to the dismissal of Mr. Cocchi, in order that it may reach a decision based on a full knowledge of the facts.
.Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that the APEEF was required to request administrative authorisations (from the Ministry of Labour and from the Police) for its establishment, and to the allegation that Mr. Roberto Alfonso was disqualified from acting as a trade union leader because of his ""ideological"" views. The Committee requests the, Government to send its observations on these aspects of the case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) As regards the dismissal of two trade union leaders on  March , the Committee takes note that one of them has been reinstated in his workplace and that another did not request",0,1983,Uruguay
115,"reinstatement at the appropriate time before the administrative authorities.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Mr. Daniel Cocchi was dismissed for acts and. omissions which undermined the trust which had been placed in this ship's captain. In order that it may examine this allegation in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to indicate specifically which concrete acts and omissions led to the dismissal of this trade union leader.(c) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that the dismissal of trade union leaders by reason of union membership or union activities is contrary to Article  of Convention No. , and could involve intimidation aimed at preventing the free exercise of their trade union functions.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the APEEF was required to request administrative authorisations (from the Ministry of Labour and the Police) for its establishment.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on' the allegation that Mr. Roberto Alfonso had been disqualified from acting as a trade union leader because of his ""ideological"" views.",1,1983,Uruguay
116,".The committee examined this case at its meetings in May  and February  and on both occasions submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report of the Committee, paragraphs  to  and rd Report of the Committee, paragraphs  to , approved by the Governing Body at its rd and th Sessions, respectively (May-June  and February )]. The Government subsequently sent additional observations in a communication dated  May .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.After the Committee's examination of this case at its February  meeting, the outstanding allegation concerned the unjustified dismissal of  workers of the financial undertaking Centro-Banco, only two of whom had been reinstated. In view of the absence of observations by the Government concerning this allegation, the Committee requested it to send its comments on the matter (see rd Report, paragraph ).
.In its communication dated  May , the Government stated, with respect to the dismissal of  workers of the financial undertaking Centro-Banco, that reinstatement of the trade union leaders had been secured through intervention by the National Directorate of Labour, while, for the remaining workers, a form of labour exchange had been established for their preferential re-employment as and when they were needed by the banking institution, the aim being to preserve by this means possibilities of future work for those unemployed because of the economic situation.
.The Committee notes with interest that, through intervention by the National Directorate of Labour, reinstatement of the trade union leaders of the financial undertaking Centro-Banco has been secured and that measures have been taken with a view to the future re-employment by that undertaking of the remaining dismissed workers. It expresses the hope that these workers will shortly be reinstated in the jobs at the Centro-Banco undertaking.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions.The Committee notes with interest the reinstatement of the trade union leaders of the financial undertaking Centro-Banco and the fact that measures have been taken with a view to the future re-employment in that undertaking of the remaining dismissed workers. It hopes that they will shortly be re-employed in the undertaking.
.The Committee examined this case at its May  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. [See th Report, paragraphs  to , approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June ).] The Government subsequently sent additional observations in communications dated  May and  September .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that Miguel Angel Mato Gajen, Juan Acua, Isolina Prez Acua and Irene Corrales have not been arrested. It further notes that, according to the Government, Pedro Ciganda, Guillermo Alvarez and Eduardo Fernndez have not been disqualified from holding trade union office.
.The Committee notes, moreover, that Homero Gramajo, one of the provisional authorities of the Association of the Banco La Caja Obrera has not presented a request to the judicial authorities for reinstatement. Nevertheless, considering that during the mediation hearings the competent administrative authorities were in favour of Homero Gramajo's reinstatement, the Committee requests the Government to contact the Banco La Caja Obrera again with a view to having him reinstated.
.With regard to the alleged refusal of permission to hold a cultural event planned by the AEBU, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, at the time of requesting the authorisation ( December )[See th Report, Case No. , para. .] the AEBU did not meet the requirements of Act No.  respecting occupational associations. Since the situation in this respect has not changed, the Committee, while noting the Government's assurances that it will make every effort to resolve the difficulties that may arise so that the Association can adapt to the new trade union legislation, expresses the hope that the AEBU will very shortly be able to exercise all trade union rights fully.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged dismissal of  workers from the financial entity Centro-Banco.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes that, according to the Government's declaration, Miguel Angel Mato Gajen , Juan Acua, Isolina Prez Acua and Irene Corrales have not been arrested and that Pedro Ciganda, Guillermo Alvarez and Eduardo Fernndez have not been disqualified from holding trade union office.(b) The Committee observes that Mr. Homero Gramajo, one of the provisional authorities of the Association of the Banco La Caja Obrera, did not present a request for reinstatement to the judicial authority after having been dismissed. Nevertheless, considering that during the mediation hearings the administrative authorities were in favour of his reinstatement, the Committee requests the Government to contact the Banco La Caja Obrera once again with a view to having Homero Gramajo reinstated.(c) As regards the allegation concerning the refusal of permission to hold a cultural event which the AEBU had wished to hold, the Committee expresses the hope that the Association will very shortly be able to exercise all trade union rights fully.(d) The Committee requests the Government to submit its observations on the alleged dismissal of  workers from the financial entity Centro-Banco.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the National Convention of Workers of Uruguay (CNT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated ,  and  August and  September . The CNT furnished further information in communications dated ,  and  January and  February , and the ICFTU in communications dated  January,  February and  and  March . The Government replied in communications of  November ,  February and  May .
.At the Government's request and in accordance with the procedure in force,' the office sent a letter to the complainants with a view to their furnishing specific information on a number of allegations (the number of occupational associations whose registration was said to have been delayed and persons disqualified from holding trade union, office). The complainants' replies to this request were passed on to the Government for it to formulate its observations thereon.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the flight to Organise Convention,'  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that although the workers of  undertakings have complied with the formalities required by the new trade union legislation for establishing organisations, the latter cannot function because although several months have passed, the Ministry of Labour has still not notified them of their registration. They include the occupational associations of the following undertakings: La Industria, Vistal, Inlasa, Paycueros (Paysand region), ASTRA, National Breweries, Pepsicola, Monte Paz Tobacco Company S.A, CASMU (Assistance Centre of the Medical Trade Union), CONAPROIF (National Co-operative of Milk Producers), Banco Comercial and Banco Litoral. The complainants specify that on  July  the associations of only four undertakings (SUDAMTEX, Banco UBUR, the Catholic Circle and ONDA) had been notified of their registration and that on  December  a number of bank employees' organisations (BANFISUD, Banco La Caja Obrera, Banco Pan de Azcar, Trade Development Bank, Banco Holands Unido, Banco Real, Banco del Plato and Banco de Boston) still had not been notified although they had all complied with the necessary formalities in January, May, June, August or September . The ICFTU encloses with its communication of  February  a document stating that, up to December ,  to  first-level association had been authorised,  of them in the banking sector. Moreover, the complainants add, the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) - a second-level organisation that existed already - is running into difficulties with the authorities in adapting to the provisions of the new system set up under the new Act respecting occupational associations and the Decree issued there under. The documentation supplied by the complainants reveals that the main problem lies in determining whether or not it is necessary, for the AEBU to be established as a second-level association, for the corresponding first-level organisations to be registered initially and, if so, whether the AEBU can obtain an extension of the  days' notice prescribed by law for adapting to the new trade union system.
.The complainants allege, furthermore, that the authorities have disqualified  members of  associations in the banking sector from acting as trade union leaders. According to the complainants, in June  the police authorities of Montevideo, in accordance with section (d) of the Decree made under the Act respecting occupational associations, informed the members of the provisional committees of the",-1,1982,Uruguay
117,"Association of officials of the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AFAEBU) and of the Bank of London that they could not belong to provisional committees, the executive committee or any other committee of the union. The disqualified leaders include Juan Pedro Ciganda, Guillermo Alvarez and Eduardo Fernndez of the AFAEBU, and Milton Antognazza of the Association of the Banco La Caja Obrera.
.The complainants also allege that at the beginning of July  the ONDA undertaking dismissed  workers, most of whom were on a list of candidates for the elections to the executive committee of the Association of Wage Earners and Salaried Employees of the ONDA undertaking. The complainants add that the financial undertaking, Centro-Banco, dismissed  workers without justification, only  of whom have been reinstated. Moreover, in November and December , Jos Buere, Ricardo Castillo and Homero Gramajo, members of the Provisional Committee of the Banco Commercial, the Trade Development Bank and the Banco La Caja Obrera (Mercedes branch) were the subjects of anti-union dismissals. In a subsequent communication, the CNT states that after intense activity, Mr. Jos Buere succeeded in being reinstated. Also dismissed were victor Sebastin, Daniel Fuentes, Claudia Vitacca and Hctor Fernndez, members of the Provisional Committee of the Labour Association of the Casa Banceria United Mizrahi Ltd, and two workers, Diegl Nadal and Karin Beinhacker.
.In addition, the complainants allege that on  December  Mr. Richard Reed and Mr. Arturo Gimnez, members of the Provisional Committee of the Workers' Association of the National Brewery, together with Luis Becerra who had been elected initially as a member of the Committee, although he was subsequently withdrawn by the police authorities, were arrested by the police authorities of Montevideo and interrogated for nine hours, after which they were released. On the following day they were once again arrested and interrogated, this time for  hours, before being finally released. According to the complainants these arrests were due to the fact that, while these three persons were having a meeting with the management of the undertaking, as previously arranged, to present the workers' claims (wage increases, representation or the Industrial Safety Committee of the undertaking and the purchase of a works ambulance), the workers on the shift which had finished work at two and three in the afternoon held a meeting in front of the works after which  workers marched along the pavement around the block in which the works are situated, in silence and without creating any disturbance whatsoever. Furthermore, the complainants allege that Miguel Angel Mato Gajen, an employee of the Fbrica Uruguaya de Neumticos, S.A, was arrested on  January  and that it is not known where he is being held. The complainants go on to say that on  March  Irene Carrales ( years old, founder of the Textile Union.), Isolina Prez de Acua ( years old) and Juan Acua ( years old, who has already spent a long time in prison) were abducted. The first two were released within five days. The ICFTU states that, in view of the poor health of Mr. Acua (who has lost a lung and has to use a pacemaker because of a heart condition.) there are fears for his life; the Confederation requests that the Government be approached.
.Finally, the complainants point out that on  December  the police informed the leaders of the AEBU that they would not grant their request to perform a ""Canto Popular"" (singing and folk music) as a tribute to the workers which had been planned for  December of the same year, on the grounds that there were so workers to pay such a tribute to and that the AEBU did no enjoy legal status when the police authorities were reminded that the previous Minister of Labour had stated before the ILO that the AEBU enjoyed legal status, that is to say, that this had not been withdrawn, the police authorities replied that this was not a matter for the Ministry of Labour but rather for the Ministry of the Interior, namely, the police.
.In its communication of  November  the Government states that, at the request of the Association of Wage Earners and Salaried Employees of the ONDA undertaking, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security had carried out an inquiry into the dismissals that had taken place in the firm and that the following conclusions had been reached: there was no record - nor had one been supplied by the said workers' association. - of any list containing the names of the persons dismissed by the ONDA undertaking; none of the persons dismissed was a member of the executive committee of any occupational association, nor a candidate for such a position; nor had there been any dismissals on anti-union grounds. The Government also states that the Association of Wage Earners and Salaried Employees of the ONDA undertaking had thanked the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for the inquiry it had carried out and the concern it had shown; it also states that no member of the Provisional Committee was dismissed.
.The Government states in its communication of  February  that so far  occupational associations of workers and  of employers had applied for registration. Of these,  associations of workers and  of employers had been registered. The Government states that not only had there been no intention on the part of the competent authorities to impede the formalities, but that in fact the department responsible for the registration of workers' associations had been endowed with the best human resources in order to facilitate and speed up the administrative work involved. The Government goes on to say that it should be noted that it is up to the parties concerned to initiate the registration formalities and that the correct procedure is not always followed. Furthermore, according to article  of the Constitution, ""all administrative authorities shall be obliged to give a ruling on any application made to them by a person having a lawful interest in the performance of a specific administrative act and to resolve administrative appeals against their decisions, following appropriate proceedings to investigate the matter, within a period of  days from the date of the last formality specified by the relevant laws or regulations. The application shall be considered to be rejected or the administrative appeal refused if no decision has been reached within the said period."" The Government adds that Decree No. / applies a timetable so that the Ministry of Labour will decide a request for registration and that the granting of registration is not a matter for discretion but that, on the contrary, the public authorities do no more than register the occupational association, the only requirement being that all the formalities prescribed by law have been complied with.
.Contrary to what was alleged, the Government continues, registration has been granted in the following cases: Inlasa ( January ), Payacueros ( August ), ASTRA ( September ), National Breweries ( September ), CASMU ( July ), Banco Comercial ( August ) and Banco Litoral ( August ). The Government adds, as regards the La Industria and Vistal undertakings, that the workers have not approached the Ministry with a view to establishing occupational organisations. The Government also points out that the employees' associations of the Banco Real del Uruguay and of the Banco de la Plata have recently submitted their statutes ( January ), that registration of the employees' associations of the Monte Paz Tobacco Company and of CONAPROIE is being dealt with and that the employees' associations of Pepsicola, Banco La Caja Obrera, Banco Pan de Azcar, Trade Development Bank, Casa Bancaria Uruguay, Banco Holands Unido and Banco de Boston are now in the final stages of the registration procedure.
.As regards the registration of the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU), the Government states that the Association has approached the ministry of Labour and Social Security on two occasions"" the first time, the application did not meet the minimum requirements laid down in section  of Act No. . respecting occupational associations and section  of the Decree made under the Act; the second time the procedure laid down in the AEBU's own regulations had not been complied with, thereby infringing section (a) of the above-mentioned Act.
.With regard to the disqualification of trade union leaders, the Government states that the trade unionist Milton Antognazza gave up his trade union post on  November  of his own accord and not because of any disqualification. The Government adds, referring to the other trade unionists from occupational associations in the banking sector who are said to have been disqualified, that the complainants would have to specify their names in order for a reply to be given. Nevertheless, the Government points out that the public authorities have no powers to ""veto"" trade union, leaders or union members. The most they could do, if they considered that some of the leaders sponsoring the application for registration did not fulfil the",-1,1982,Uruguay
118,"legal requirements, would be not to register the occupational association - a decision, moreover, that could be appealed before the courts.
.With regard to the alleged dismissals, the Government states that, because of the closure of one sector of the activities of United Mizrahi Ltd, six workers - including four trade unionists - voluntarily decided not to continue in this Bank. The Government supplies copies of the resignations signed by the workers concerned. In addition, the Government states that, following measures taken by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the reinstatement was secured of the trade unionists Ricardo Castillo (Trade Development Bank) and Mr. Jos Buere (Banco Comercial). According to the Government, the situation of Mr. Homero Gramajo (Banco La Caja Obrera) is different since acts have been perpetrated by this worker that might be described as extremely bad conduct; if these acts were confirmed there would be justified grounds for dismissal in accordance with the law. Nevertheless, the Government points out that in making this statement, it has not given a ruling since this lies within the jurisdiction of the courts.
.Lastly, in its communication of  May , the Government states that the three trade unionists of the National Brewery referred to by the complainants were not arrested but were invited to present themselves at the Montevideo police headquarters to explain the workers' presence in front of the brewery while those three unionists were negotiating with the employer, since the authorities had not been notified of this gathering. Once the trade unionists explained that it was a spontaneous action they left the police headquarters. The following day,  December , they were again requested to visit the headquarters to sign explanatory statements after which they immediately left the premises.
.As regards the alleged delay on the part of the authorities in sending notification of the registration of occupational associations, thereby preventing the latter from operating, the Committee notes the Government's statements, in particular, that so far  associations of workers and  of employers have applied for registration and that  associations of workers and  of employers have already been registered. The Committee also notes that in order to facilitate and speed up administrative activity, the department for the registration of workers' associations has been endowed with the best personnel resources.
.With regard to the associations which the complainants state have not been notified of their registration, the Committee observes that the workers of two undertakings had never applied for registration, that seven employees' associations have already been notified of their registration, that six are in the final stages of the registration procedure, two are being dealt with and two more have recently submitted their statutes.
.The committee observes in this respect that five employees' associations which, according to the complainants, had begun to take steps with a view to registration between January and September , have still not been registered and that the Government, without actually denying the date on which the proceedings began, has stated that these associations are in the last stages of the proceedings. These are the workers' associations of the Banco La Caja Obrera, the Banco Pan de Azcar, the Trade Development Bank, the Banco Holands Unido and the Banco de Boston. On the last point, although the Committee notes that the Government has stated generally that the persons concerned do not always comply with the formalities involved in registration, the Committee cannot fail to express its concern at the long period of time that has elapsed without these associations having been registered and at the fact that, so far, only  out of a total of  workers' associations that applied for registration have obtained it. The committee trusts that the registration procedures under way will soon be concluded.
.In this connection, the Committee observes that article  of the Constitution provides for up to  days for a decision to be reached on applications made to the administrative authorities and that, in accordance with sections  and  of Decree No. /, of  August , the period during which workers' organisations may be obliged to wait before they can function as such may be as much as six months. The Committee also notes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations commented on this point when it examined the application of Convention No.  in Uruguay. Consequently the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to modifying the trade union legislation so that a special period, as short as possible, may be prescribed during which the competent administrative authority undertakes the registration of occupational associations.
.As regards the difficulties that the AEBU (a second-level organisation already in existence) is said to be experiencing in adapting to the system laid down by the new trade union legislation, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the AEBU submitted two applications for registration but that neither of them complied with the formalities required by law. The Committee observes that for the complainants the main problem lies in determining whether or not it is necessary, for the AEBU to be constituted as a second-level association, for the corresponding first-level associations to have first been set up as registered and, if so, whether the AEBU can obtain an extension of the  days provided for by law so that organisations already in existence such as the AEBU can adapt to the new trade union system. In this respect the Committee expresses the hope that the AEBU will be able to count on the co-operation of the authorities in resolving whatever difficulties may arise for existing occupational associations in adapting to the new trade union legislation.
.As regards the allegations that certain workers have been disqualified from holding trade union office, the Committee notes the Government's statements, particularly that according to which Mr. Milton Antognazza withdrew from trade union office of his own accord on  November , and not because of any disqualification.
.The Committee wishes to recall that, at the Government's request, the office asked the complainants to indicate the names of the other disqualified persons and that, in reply, the complainants mentioned the AFAEBU trade unionists, Mr. Pedro Ciganda, Mr. Guillermo Alvarez and Mr. Eduardo Fernndez. The Committee observes, nevertheless, that the Government has made no reference to these trade unionists. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the disqualification from trade union office to which they are said to have been subjected.
.As regards the allegation that at the beginning of July  the ONDA undertaking dismissed  workers, most of whom were on the list of candidates for the elections to the executive committee of the Wage Earners and Salaried Employees' Association of the ONDA undertaking, the Committee notes that, at the request of the said Association, the Government carried out an inquiry into the dismissals and that the inquiry found that none of the persons dismissed was a member of or candidate for election to a trade union executive committee and that there was no proof of anti-union motives. The Committee also notes that none of the members of the Provisional Committee of the workers' association in question was dismissed and that the association had thanked the ministry of Labour and Social Security for the inquiry carried out and the concern it had demonstrated. In these circumstances, the committee considers that this allegation calls for no further examination.
.As regards the other dismissals said to have been made on anti-union grounds, the Committee notes with interest that, thanks to the measures taken by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the reinstatement of the trade unionists Ricardo Castillo and Jos Buere was obtained. The Committee notes that the trade unionists of the United Mizrahi Ltd referred to by the complainants were not dismissed but voluntarily resigned their jobs because of the closure of one sector of the Bank's activities. The Committee also notes the Government's statements concerning the allegations respecting the dismissal of Mr. Homero Gramajo, a trade unionist of the Banco La Caja Obrera. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation with regard to this trade union leader.
.As regards the alleged arrest on two occasions of three trade unionists of the National Brewery (the first time for  hours and the second for  hours), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, they were not arrested but were invited, on two occasions, to the Montevideo Police headquarters to explain a workers' gathering which had not been notified to the authorities. Nevertheless, given that the workers' gathering took place peacefully and spontaneously, the Committee would draw the Government's attention to the fact that the apprehension and systematic or arbitrary interrogation by the police of trade union leaders and unionists involve a danger of abuse and could constitute a serious attack on trade union rights.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied on the remaining allegations: the dismissal of  workers from the financial entity",-1,1982,Uruguay
119,"Centro-Banco: the arrest of Miguel Angel Mato Gajen of the Fabric Uruguaya de Neumticos, S.A, of Juan Acua, Isolina Prez de Acua and Irene Corrales (the last two persons have now been released), and the refusal of permission to hold a cultural event planned by the AEBU. The committee requests the Government to supply its observations on these allegations as soon as possible.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) As regards the alleged delay on the part of the authorities in notifying the registration of occupational associations, thereby preventing them from functioning:(i) the Committee expresses its concern at the period of time elapsed during which certain occupational associations have not obtained registration despite having complied with the formalities and the fact that, so far, only  out of a total of  workers' associations which applied for registration have obtained it. The Committee trusts that the registration procedures now under way will be concluded shortly.(ii) The Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to amending the legislation on trade unions so that the shortest possible time may be prescribed for the competent administrative authority to undertake the registration of occupational associations.(b) As regards the difficulties which the AEBU is said to encountering in adapting to the system of the new trade union legislation, the Committee expresses the hope that the AEBU will be able to court on the co-operation of the authorities to solve whatever difficulties might arise in the procedure of adaptation of occupational associations already in existence to the new trade union legislation.(c) As regards the alleged disqualification of a number of trade unionists from holding trade union office, the Committee notes that Mr. Milton Antognazza withdrew from trade union office of his own accord and not because of any disqualification. The Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the disqualifications to which the AFAEBU trade unionists Mr. Pedro Ciganda, Mr. Guillermo Alvrez and Mr. Eduardo Fernndez are said to have been subjected.(d) With regard to the allegations of dismissals on anti-union grounds:(i) The Committee notes with interest that, thanks to the intervention of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the trade unionists Ricardo Castillo and Jos Buere were reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation with regard to the dismissal of Mr. Romero Gramajo, a worker in the Banco La Caja Obrera.(ii) The Committee considers that the allegations concerning the dismissal of workers from the ONDA undertaking and from United Mizrahi Ltd call for no further examination.(e) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the apprehension and systematic or arbitrary interrogation by the police of trade union leaders and unionists involves a danger of abuse and could constitute a serious attack on trade union rights.(f) With regard to the remaining allegations (dismissal of  workers from the financial entity Centro-Banco; the arrest of Miguel Angel Mato Gajen, of the Fbrica Uruguaya de Neumticos, S.A, of Juan.

120,".On  August , the Government sent information on Cases Nos. , , , , ,  and  concerning allegations of infringements of freedom of association presented by numerous workers' organisations. Its communication contained details of the steps taken since the Government assumed power on  March  to halt the deterioration in the trade union situation in Uruguay and restore democracy. The Committee intends to examine all these cases, which relate to a trade union situation that arose under the regime that came to power as a result of the military takeover in , in a single document.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its letter of  August , the Government states that the process of institutionalising democracy, and therefore of remedying the trade union situation, began on  March . It recalls that it sent a representative to the May  meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association to explain what was happening and that a government representative informed the Governing Body of the ILO that a democratic Uruguay had now returned to the Organisation which was aware of its responsibilities and prepared to respect its commitments. The Government goes on to supply details of the various cases before the Committee.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction the information communicated by the Government on these cases and, specifically, the repeal of the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of several complaints, the revoking of the resolutions dissolving the National Workers' Convention (CNT) and the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT) and the resumption by these two organisations of their trade union activities in Uruguay.
.The Committee trusts that the Government of Uruguay will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the interested parties; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of complaints by several workers' organisations has been repealed and that the National Workers' Convention and the Inter-union Workers' Assembly are now participating legally in the trade union life of the country.(b) The Committee trusts that the Government will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the parties concerned; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments in the trade union situation.
.When the Committee examined these cases at its November  meeting, it made the following recommendations on the allegations which were pending:(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Cases Rodrguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt, in respect of whom it wished to be kept informed of any action taken) and that it has also expressed the hope that this request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.(b) With reference to the list of  trade unionists detained, tried or sentenced in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused (Milton Morales - in detention, David Calleros, Jess Eguren, Jaime Lpez, Mara Martnez , Carlos Mechoso, Roberto Meirelles, Dimar Silva - all undergoing trial; Jorge Alvarez, Rubn Bello, Diego Brugnole, Jaime Bugarn, Julio Durante, Jos Glisenti, Carlos Goerrero, Miguel Guzmn, Yolanda Ibarra, Luis Iguini, Ral Larraya, Wilman Lasena, Francisco Laurenzo, Waldamar de Len, Len Lev, Miguel Longo, Francisco Maiorana, Guillermo Martiello, Leandro Moreira, Rogelio Ortiz, Norberto Quintana, Ramn R. Reyes, Toms Rivero, Washington Rodrguez Belleti, Hugo Rossi and Edgardo Torres - all sentenced), the Committee observes that the Government has indicated in a general manner the acts which led to their trial and that some of these activities have no connection whatsoever with freedom of association and constitute offences under ordinary law. However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for engaging in activities of a trade union character. It also requests that the Government supply information on this matter.
.In its communications of  and  March  the Government states that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti is in hiding and that all the other persons mentioned by the complainants, with the exception of Rubn Bello and Len Lev (the latter of whom was sentenced for forgery) have been freed, some of them in application of the law of amnesty for political offences.
.In connection with the allegations which remained pending, the Committee notes with satisfaction the release of  of the  trade union leaders and trade unionists who had been arrested, brought to trial or sentenced, some of them as a result of the application of the law of amnesty for political offences. As regards the remaining three persons who had been sentenced, the Committee notes that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti (a sugar workers' leader) is in hiding and that Rubn Bello (a port workers' leader) and Len Lev (a member of a bank workers' union) are serving prison sentences (the latter for forgery). The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete facts serving as grounds for the sentences passed on the first two trade unionists mentioned in order to enable it to determine whether or not these sentences were based on trade union activities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that  of the  trade union leaders and trade unionists who had been arrested, brought to trial or sentenced have now been released, some of them as a result of the application of the law of amnesty for political offences.(b) As regards the three remaining persons, who had been sentenced, the Committee notes that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti (a sugar workers' leader) is in hiding and that Rubn Bello (a port workers' leader) and Len Lev (a member of a bank workers' union) have been sentenced to imprisonment (the latter for forgery). The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete facts serving as grounds for the sentences passed on the first two trade unionists mentioned in order to enable it to determine whether or not these sentences were based on trade union activities.
.The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release to the ten trade union leaders and trade unionists and has also expressed its hope that the request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.
.With reference to the list of  trade unionists who were detained, tried or sentenced and in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused, the Committee observes that the Government has indicated in a general manner the acts which led to their trial, and has indicated that the activities of which they were accused were undertaken for the benefit of the Communist Party. The Committee observes that some of these activities have no connection whatsoever with freedom of association and that they constitute offences under ordinary law (possession of weapons, forging of documents, use of false identity documents, attacks with rocket launchers, attacks on commercial premises, etc.). However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities regardless of whether they were calculated to favour the objectives of the Communist Party. This would seem to be the case, for example, with the collection of monetary contributions and the printing and distribution of leaflets. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for having engaged in activities of a trade union character. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on this matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists and that it has also expressed the hope",0,1981,Uruguay
121,"that this request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.(b) With reference to the list of  trade unionists detained, tried or sentenced in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused, the Committee observes that the Government has indicated in a general manner the acts which led to their trial and that some of these activities have no connection whatsoever with freedom of association and constitute offences under ordinary law. However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for engaging in activities of a trade union character. It also requests that the Government supply information on this matter.
.The Committee notes with interest that, in accordance with its request, the Military Supreme Court granted the early release of the trade unionist Alberto Altesor, in view of his state of health.The Committee also notes the outcome of the inquiries carried out to ascertain the whereabouts of the dockworker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz. The Committee further notes that the trade unionists Jorge Luis Bessio, Neber Corral and Ral Lpez have been unconditionally released.
.The Committee notes that, in connection with its request to the Government to explain the facts which gave rise to the trial, sentencing and detention of the other  persons, the Government states that it has already provided full information in its present or former replies. In this respect, the Committee must point out that the Government merely listed the types of offences which the persons in question had allegedly committed. Most of the offences listed relate to ""subversive association"", ""conspiracy against the Constitution"" and other criminal actions, and there is no way of ascertaining if the detention, trial or sentencing of those concerned was linked to the exercise of trade union activities; the Committee therefore requests the Government once again to state the concrete facts leading to their arrest and to indicate whether they are still detained.
.Finally, the Committee recalls that it requested the Government to take measures to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Casas Rodrguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Belvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quintero Bethancourt) and to inform it of any action taken in this respect. As the Government has not submitted any information on this matter, the Committee can only reiterate its request.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with interest that, in accordance with its request, the Military Supreme Court has granted the early release of the trade unionist Alberto Altesor, in view of his state of health. The Committee also notes the outcome of the inquiries carried out by the authorities to ascertain the whereabouts of the dockworker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz. The Committee further notes that the trade unionists Jorge Luis Bessio, Neber Corral and Ral Lpez have been unconditionally released.(b) Although the Committee notes that the Government has stated the types of offences allegedly committed by the  trade unionists mentioned in the attached list, it requests the Government to indicate the concrete facts leading to their arrest so that it might ascertain if their detention, trial or sentencing was linked to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee asks the Government to supply information on the situation of these persons, in particular whether they are detained.(c) The Committee requests the Government once again to take measures to secure the release of the trade union leaders and trade unionists Alberto Casas Rodriguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt and to inform it of any action taken in this respect.
.The Committee examined these cases at its November  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Subsequently, the World Federation of Trade Unions sent additional information in communications dated  November and  December . The Government replied in communications dated  January,  February and  May .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee noted with interest that of the persons mentioned in the list of detained trade union leaders and trade unionists supplied by the CNT,  had been released and  did not appear on any records as having been arrested, and requested the Government for its observations regarding the  persons to whom it had not referred and to state the facts which had given rise to the trial or sentencing of the rest of persons on the list. As regards the alleged disappearance of trade unionists, the Committee requested the Government to make inquiries in order to ascertain the whereabouts of the dock worker trade unionist, Pedro Ortiz, and to inform it accordingly. The Committee also requested the Government to take measures to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Casas Rodriguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Benelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt) and to inform it of any action taken in this respect. It further requested the Government to keep it informed of any initiatives taken to apply measures of clemency regarding imprisoned trade unionists in poor health and, in particular, of any action taken regarding the application before the military courts for the early release of Mr. Alberto Altesor.
.In a communication dated  November , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) informed the Committee of the death of the trade union leader Ramn Freire Pizzano in the ""Libertad"" prison adding that, according to members of his family, his state of health had deteriorated as a result of ill treatment in the prison. In a subsequent communication, the WFTU stated that the news of this trade union leader's death was later denied by the same sources of information which had originally announced it.
.As regards the  trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CNT, about whom the Committee had requested the Government for its observations since it had not referred to them in its previous replies, the Government states that Celiar Reherman, Graciela Mario, Alcides Nez, Carlos Oxley, Ariel Fernndez Cirigliano and Enrique Rodriguez have been released, that there is no record of the detention of Miguel Carbajal, Miguel Garcia, Sergio Garcia, Alcibiades Techero and Felipe Vera, and that Carlos Tutzo (sentenced for subversive association), though he has not applied for an early release, will probably be released on  July . As regards the trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CNT about whom the Committee had requested the Government to state the facts giving rise to their trial or sentencing, the Government states that Ulises Pereira was released on  September, Odilio Rovira on  December and Bonito Alvario on  December . The Government also indicates the crimes for which the following persons were sentenced: Jos Bessio and Wilman Lasena (subversive association.), Rubn Bello and Miguel Angel Guzmn (subversive association and attack on the Constitution).
.The Government also states that, in order to demonstrate the false nature of the information supplied by the WFTU in its communication of  November , it invited various heads of diplomatic missions accredited in the country to visit the penitentiary in which Mr. Ramn Freire Pizzano is imprisoned; during the visit, which took place on  November , the heads of the diplomatic missions were able to verify the trade union leader's perfect state of health and the conditions in which he is serving his sentence.
.Lastly, the Government states that the application for the early release of Mr. Alberto Altesor is under study by the Military Supreme Court and, as requested of the competent authority, inquiries are being made to ascertain, the whereabouts of the dock worker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz. The Committee will be informed of the outcome.
.As regards the  trade union leaders and trade unionists alleged to have been detained according to the list supplied by the CNT, about whom the Government had not replied, the Committee notes with interest that, according to the Government, Celiar Reherman, Graciela Mario, Alcides Nez, Carlos Oxley, Ariel Fernndez Cirigliano and Enrique Rodriguez have been released, that there is no record of the detention of Miguel Carbajal, Miguel Garcia, Sergio Garcia, Alcibiades",-1,1981,Uruguay
122,"Techero and Felipe Vera, and that Carlos Tutzo, though he has not applied for an early release, will probably be released on  July .
.As regards the  trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CNT, about whom the Committee had requested the Government to state the facts giving rise to their detention, trial or sentencing, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Ulises Pereira, Odilio Rovira and Benito Alvario have been released. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet supplied the information requested about the remaining  trade union leaders and trade unionists. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to supply this information as soon as possible.
.As regards the allegation, subsequently denied by the WFTU, that the state of health of the trade union leader Ramn Freire Pizzano had deteriorated as a result of the ill treatment received in prison and that he had died, the Committee notes that the Government invited various heads of diplomatic missions accredited in the country to visit the penitentiary in which Mr. Freire Pizzano is imprisoned and that these diplomats were able to verify the trade union leader's state of health and the conditions in which he is serving his sentence.
.Concerning the allegations in connection with which the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of further developments, the Committee notes that the Government has ordered inquiries to be made in order to ascertain the whereabouts of the dock worker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz, that it will be informed of the outcome of the inquiries and that the application for the early release of the trade unionist Alberto Altesor is now under study by the Military Supreme Court. The Committee expresses the hope that, in view of this trade unionist's delicate state of health, the Count will decide on his early release shortly, and requests the Government to communicate the text of the decision taken. The committee also recalls that it requested the Government to take measures to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Casas Rodriquez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson: Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt) and to inform it of any action taken in this respect. Since the Government has not supplied any information on the matter, the Committee can only reiterate its conclusions.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with interest that certain trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CWT have been released and that another trade unionist will probably be released on  July .(b) The Committee requests the Government to explain, as soon as' possible, the facts which gave rise to the trial, sentencing or detention of the  trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the attached list of detained persons supplied by the CNT.(c) The Committee notes that the trade union leader Ramn Freire Pizzano has not died and that, according to the Government, he is in perfect health at the penitentiary where he is serving his sentence.(d) The Committee notes that the Government has ordered inquiries to be made to ascertain the whereabouts of the dock worker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz and will inform the Committee of the outcome.(e) The Committee expresses the hope that, in view of the delicate state of health of the trade unionist Alberto Altesor, the Court will decide on his early release shortly. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the text of the decision taken.(f) The Committee again requests the Government to take measures to secure the release of the trade union leaders and trade unionists Alberto Casas Rodriguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt and to inform it of any action taken in this respect.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the National Workers Convention of Uruguay (CNT) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), dated  December  and ,  and  January  respectively. The WFTU, the CNT and the ICFTU sent supplementary information in communications dated  February,  April and  August  respectively. The Government furnished its reply in communications dated  May,  October and  November .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (NO. ).
.The complainants allege that the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU), a trade union set up in accordance with the provisions of the Act respecting occupational associations and the decree regulating the application thereof was obliged to obtain permission from the Police Headquarters in Montevideo to organise its first assembly. The complainants add that, on  December , some participants of this assembly were apprehended by the police and subjected to interrogation, and that tape recordings were made of the proceedings and taken away by officials of the Ministry of the Interior.
.The complainants also allege the arbitrary arrest by the police of Jos d'Elia (President of the CNT), Carlos Gmez (ex-President of the AEBU and ex-Vice-President of the CNT), Bernardo Groisman (ex-leader of the Needleworkers Union), who have since been released, and the arrest of the trade unionists Luis Viera, Roberto Meirelles, Nicols Llad, Rubn Onelli Arias, Alberto Ortiz and Rubn Pereira.
.The complainants further allege the arrest of Ramn Freire Pizzano (member of the National Board of the CNT), Elbio Quinteros (leader of the Municipal Workers and Employees Union of Montevideo), Helvecio Bonelli (leader of the Uruguayan Press Association and member of the National Board of the CNT), Alberto Urruty (local Committee delegate of the Omnibus Workers Organisation), Nelson Cuello (trade unionist working at the oil refinery of the State undertaking ANCAP), Gene Mateos Calvete (worker at the ANCAP oil refinery), Daniel Uriarte (member of the local trade union management board of ANCAP), Armando Coronel (member of the local Committee of public health), Alberto Casas Rodriguez (bank employee and trade union delegate at his workplace) and Umberto Bonelli (bank employee). According to the complainants, a statement from the Police Headquarters of Montevideo dated  January  maintained that this group was a trade union splinter of the Communist Party and accused the group of seeking to organise legal trade unions by drawing membership from workers who were not known to be communists which would enable the establishment of a legal movement secretly directed by the Communist Party and the revival of the CNT which had been declared illegal. The statement in question indicates that the ten persons were brought before a military court which tried them for offences committed under section  of the Military Penal Code (""Subversive Associations""), section (L)() in conjunction with section  (XII) of the Constitution (""Conspiracy against the Constitution followed by preparatory acts"") and section  (IV) of the Military Penal Code """"Assistance to illegal associations""). The complainants go on to allege that the political and ideological repression of all opponents of the Government extends to the trade union movement and in this way the police can accuse a group of workers of belonging to any ""antinational"", ""subversive"" ideology if they commit the so-called ""crime"" of trying to organise legal trade unions and it may bring them before a military court.
.Furthermore, the CNT encloses a list of trade union leaders and trade unionists who are currently in prison (see Annex), and the WFTU points out that since the promulgation of the decree regulating the Act respecting occupational associations, approximately  trade unionists have disappeared, including the dockworker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz subsequent to his arrest.
.Finally, the complainants point out that some trade union leaders and trade unionists who are serving prison sentences in the ""Libertad"" penitentiary are seriously ill and refer in particular to Hugo Rodrguez, Jos Pedro Mrquez and Alberto Altesor. The family of the last-mentioned prisoner has requested his transfer to Argentina to undergo a medical operation.
.In a further communication dated  August , the ICFTU states that Mr. Altesor was allowed to undergo a heart operation, attended by his own doctor, in July . The operation was successful and his health is now improving. The ICFTU requests that he be released from detention on humanitarian grounds.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that the fact that it is sending information on the various complaints does not imply its recognition of the legal capacity of those who claim to be spokesmen of the ""National Workers Convention of Uruguay"", an association which was declared illegal by the Government on  June  because of its activities unrelated to trade unionism",-1,1981,Uruguay
123,"and its support of the terrorist movement.
.The Government states that the convening of the first assembly of the AEBU was expressly authorised by the Police Headquarters of Montevideo, that approximately  persons participated in the assembly and that no arrests were made or interrogations carried out.
.As regards the allegations concerning arrested trade unionists, the Government supplies the following information on the persons concerned:- d'Elia, Jos Artigas: Although his arrest was ordered by requisition No.  dated  July  of the Defence Information Service for having conspired against the Government and the institutions of the country, his arrest has not yet been registered and therefore the accounts made to the contrary are totally false.- Gmez Perrotti, Carlos Adolfo: Arrested and interned under the emergency security measures (Constitution, section , para. ) on  October ; released on  January .

Tried on the same charges as in the previous cases.- Freire Pizzano, Ramn: Arrested on  November . Since  this person has committed numerous offences, including activities carried out on behalf of the dissolved CNT, an organisation which he used to commit acts of conspiracy against the Government. Along with the above-mentioned persons, he participated in the activities undertaken at the printing centre of the illegal Communist Party. Tried by the Military Judge of the Third Circuit on charges similar to those contained in the previous cases.- Coronel Baez, Armando: Arrested on  November .

Arrested on  November  whilst dismantling a printing centre of the illegal Communist Party; a warrant was issued for the search of his residence and the machinery and equipment used to print party propaganda was seized. The accused admitted his membership in the clandestine fragment of the illegal Communist Party and in January  was tried by the Military Judge of the Third Circuit on the charge of having committed the offences contained in section (V) of the Military Penal Code """"Subversive Associations"") and section  (XII) of the Military Penal Code (""Conspiracy against the Constitution followed by preparatory acts"").- Urruty Pizarro, Alberto: Arrested on  November . Tried by the Military Court of the Third Circuit on the charge of having violated section  (VI) of the Military Penal Code.- Quinteros Bethancourt, Elbio Timeteo: Barrister by profession, since  has committed numerous offences.

Tried by the Military Tribunal of the Third Circuit in January  on the charge of having committed offences covered by section  of the Military Penal Code (""Subversive Associations"" and ""Conspiracy against the Constitution followed by preparatory acts"").
.With regard to the allegation concerning the disappearance of approximately  trade unionists, the Government states that although it has always made every effort to reply to the complaints which have been presented, this is impossible in the present allegation since no names or concrete information have been provided. The Government adds that the name of Pedro Ortiz Larrechen - who according to the complainants disappeared after his arrest - does not appear in the register of arrested persons. The Government states that the medical attention for persons prosecuted in the military courts who require specialist attention is provided by the Central Hospital of the Armed Forces, a model hospital centre offering the services of the best specialists and full medical care, which is identical for both prisoners and military personnel and their families. The Government confirms the weak health of Hugo Rodriguez, Jos Pedro Mrquez and Alberto Altesor and states that they are receiving proper medical attention with reference in particular to the last-mentioned person, the Government points out that this prisoner was examined in November  at the request of his family by the Argentinian doctor, Rene Favaloro, who in consultation with a medical team from the Central Hospital recorded a series of abnormalities which were believed to be operable. They recommended cardio-coronary examinations which were carried out on  January  with the following results: the aorta valve has biological prosthesis and severe paraprosthetic insufficiencies; an  per cent lesion of the first third of the coronary artery descending from behind with calibre open to two-thirds; and an insufficiency of the left ventricle with serious venocapillary and pulmonary hypertension. Since the prisoner in question, indicated in a note that he had decided not to be operated on before consulting the members of his family and his attending physician, the request for transfer was approved. Recently, with the consent of his treating physician and family, Mr. Altesor underwent a second operation from which he is presently recuperating. Lastly, the Government states that the permission to release Mr. Altesor ahead of time rests with the military courts.
.Finally, in its communication of  November , the Government sends information on the majority of the persons mentioned in the list of detained persons sent by the CNT (see Annex). The Government states in particular that not all the persons referred to by the CNT are detained and that those who are detained have been tried in conformity with the law for illegal acts and not because of their trade union activities or their links with occupational organisations. The Government also gives the offences with which they were charged and sentenced.
.The Committee notes that the complainants in the present case have made allegations concerning the arrest, prosecution or disappearance of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the state of health of other persons serving prison sentences and events which allegedly took place during the first assembly of the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay.
.With regard to this last-mentioned point, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, no arrests or interrogations were made at this assembly. The Committee observes, however, that the complainants allege that the AEBU had to request authorisation from the Police Headquarters in Montevideo to hold the assembly and that the Government appears to confirm this in its statements. The Committee also notes that, according to the complainants, officials of",-1,1981,Uruguay
124,"the Ministry of the Interior took away a tape recording of the proceedings of the assembly and that the Government has not replied to this point. In this respect the Committee would draw the attention of the Government to the fact that, under Article . of Convention No. , the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict or impede the lawful exercise of the right of workers organisations to organise their administration and activities. The Committee would point out in particular that the right of trade union organisations to meet freely in their own premises without the need for any prior authorisation and without any form of control by the authorities constitutes a fundamental element of freedom of association.,
.As regards the allegation concerning the arrest of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Jos d'Ela has not been arrested and that no record appears of the arrest of Nicols Llad and Rubn Onelli. The Committee also notes that Carlos Gmez and Bernardo Groisman have now been released. In this connection, since it is not in possession of sufficient information to determine the circumstances in which the arrest of these two persons took place, the Committee would recall that the preventive detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists and measures of preventive detention in general constitute a serious danger to trade union freedom and may involve a serious interference in trade union activities.
.The Committee observes furthermore that some trade union leaders continue to be held in detention and have been tried for offences concerning ""Subversive Associations"", ""Conspiracy against the Constitution followed by preparatory acts"" and ""Aid to the Associations"". The persons in question are Luis Viera, Roberto Meirelles, Alberto Ortiz Feij, Rubn Pereira, Alberto Casas Rodriguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Baez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt.
.With regard to the first four persons, the Committee notes that the complainants simply allege their arrest without providing any further information on the circumstances in which the arrests occurred and, in particular, without demonstrating the alleged relationship between the trade union status or activities of these persons and their arrest. In these circumstances, and in the absence of more detailed information from the complainants, the Committee can only take note of the offences which the persons allegedly committed and recall the general importance of the principle mentioned above.
.With regard to the other ten trade union leaders and trade unionists arrested and brought before the military courts, the Committee notes that the Government has not referred to the alleged exercise of trade union activities by these persons and that it would appear from the statements made that at least the majority of these persons were arrested in connection with the dismantling of a propaganda centre of the illegal Communist Party. The Committee notes, however, that, according to the statement issued by the Police Headquarters in Montevideo to which the complainants make reference, the persons in question were arrested and tried because the group was a trade union splinter of the Communist Party which sought to organise legal trade unions in order to establish a legal movement which would be secretly directed by the Communist Party with a view to the possible reorganisation of the CNT which had been declared illegal. In this connection, the Committee must recall that when previous allegations have been submitted concerning measures of a political nature - such as the prohibition of the Communist Party - which may indirectly involve interference with the exercise of trade union rights, it has drawn attention to the right of workers without distinction whatsoever to set up and join trade unions of their own choosing. The public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures towards the release of the trade union leaders and trade unionists in question and to inform it of any action taken in this respect.
.The Committee notes the information sent by the Government on the CNT list of detained trade union leaders and trade unionists, and in particular that the detained persons have been tried for illegal activities and not because of their trade union activities or links with occupational organisations. The Committee notes with interest that  have been released and that  do not appear on any records as having been detained. Nevertheless, the Committee observes that the Government does not send any information on  persons and that the rest - concerning whom the Government gives the offences with which they were charged - are being tried or have been sentenced. As these persons are all trade union leaders or trade unionists, the Committee requests the Government to indicate the facts which gave rise to the trial or sentencing so that it can decide on this aspect of the case in full knowledge of the facts.
.With regard to the alleged disappearance of  trade unionists, the Committee observes that the complainants have indicated only the name of Pedro Ortiz. In this respect the Committee takes note of the statement of the Government that the name of Pedro Ortiz does not appear on the register of arrested persons and that it is impossible to reply to an allegation concerning disappearances when no names or concrete information are provided. The Committee requests the Government to make inquiries with a view to ascertaining the whereabouts of the dockworker trade unionist, Pedro Ortiz, and to inform the Committee accordingly.
.As concerns the trade union leaders and trade unionists Hugo Rodriguez, Jos Pedro Mrquez and Alberto Altesor, who are serving prison 'sentences in the ""Libertad"" penitentiary and who are seriously ill, the Committee takes note of the assurances given by the Government concerning the medical attention which they are receiving. The Committee observes in particular that the services of the best specialists are available at the military hospital where they are being treated, that medical attention is identical for prisoners and for military personnel and their families and that Alberto Altesor has now undergone a heart operation, attended by his own doctor, and that his health is now improving. The Committee also notes that permission for the anticipated release of Mr. Altesor rests with the military courts,
.Finally, the Committee must make the general observation that many trade unionists continue to be imprisoned. The Committee is convinced that any initiative undertaken by the Government with a view to applying measures of clemency, in particular as regards trade unionists who have been sentenced to prison terms and who are in poor health, will make a positive contribution to the establishment of a climate of confidence which is indispensable for the normalisation of trade union activity in the country and the effective exercise of trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken in this connection and, in particular, of the result of the application before the military courts for the anticipated release of Mr. Alberto Altesor.",-1,1981,Uruguay
125,".On  August , the Government sent information on Cases Nos. , , , , ,  and  concerning allegations of infringements of freedom of association presented by numerous workers' organisations. Its communication contained details of the steps taken since the Government assumed power on  March  to halt the deterioration in the trade union situation in Uruguay and restore democracy. The Committee intends to examine all these cases, which relate to a trade union situation that arose under the regime that came to power as a result of the military takeover in , in a single document.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its letter of  August , the Government states that the process of institutionalising democracy, and therefore of remedying the trade union situation, began on  March . It recalls that it sent a representative to the May  meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association to explain what was happening and that a government representative informed the Governing Body of the ILO that a democratic Uruguay had now returned to the Organisation which was aware of its responsibilities and prepared to respect its commitments. The Government goes on to supply details of the various cases before the Committee.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction the information communicated by the Government on these cases and, specifically, the repeal of the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of several complaints, the revoking of the resolutions dissolving the National Workers' Convention (CNT) and the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT) and the resumption by these two organisations of their trade union activities in Uruguay.
.The Committee trusts that the Government of Uruguay will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the interested parties; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of complaints by several workers' organisations has been repealed and that the National Workers' Convention and the Inter-union Workers' Assembly are now participating legally in the trade union life of the country.(b) The Committee trusts that the Government will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the parties concerned; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments in the trade union situation.
.When the Committee examined these cases at its November  meeting, it made the following recommendations on the allegations which were pending:(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Cases Rodrguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt, in respect of whom it wished to be kept informed of any action taken) and that it has also expressed the hope that this request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.(b) With reference to the list of  trade unionists detained, tried or sentenced in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused (Milton Morales - in detention, David Calleros, Jess Eguren, Jaime Lpez, Mara Martnez , Carlos Mechoso, Roberto Meirelles, Dimar Silva - all undergoing trial; Jorge Alvarez, Rubn Bello, Diego Brugnole, Jaime Bugarn, Julio Durante, Jos Glisenti, Carlos Goerrero, Miguel Guzmn, Yolanda Ibarra, Luis Iguini, Ral Larraya, Wilman Lasena, Francisco Laurenzo, Waldamar de Len, Len Lev, Miguel Longo, Francisco Maiorana, Guillermo Martiello, Leandro Moreira, Rogelio Ortiz, Norberto Quintana, Ramn R. Reyes, Toms Rivero, Washington Rodrguez Belleti, Hugo Rossi and Edgardo Torres - all sentenced), the Committee observes that the Government has indicated in a general manner the acts which led to their trial and that some of these activities have no connection whatsoever with freedom of association and constitute offences under ordinary law. However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for engaging in activities of a trade union character. It also requests that the Government supply information on this matter.
.In its communications of  and  March  the Government states that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti is in hiding and that all the other persons mentioned by the complainants, with the exception of Rubn Bello and Len Lev (the latter of whom was sentenced for forgery) have been freed, some of them in application of the law of amnesty for political offences.
.In connection with the allegations which remained pending, the Committee notes with satisfaction the release of  of the  trade union leaders and trade unionists who had been arrested, brought to trial or sentenced, some of them as a result of the application of the law of amnesty for political offences. As regards the remaining three persons who had been sentenced, the Committee notes that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti (a sugar workers' leader) is in hiding and that Rubn Bello (a port workers' leader) and Len Lev (a member of a bank workers' union) are serving prison sentences (the latter for forgery). The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete facts serving as grounds for the sentences passed on the first two trade unionists mentioned in order to enable it to determine whether or not these sentences were based on trade union activities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that  of the  trade union leaders and trade unionists who had been arrested, brought to trial or sentenced have now been released, some of them as a result of the application of the law of amnesty for political offences.(b) As regards the three remaining persons, who had been sentenced, the Committee notes that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti (a sugar workers' leader) is in hiding and that Rubn Bello (a port workers' leader) and Len Lev (a member of a bank workers' union) have been sentenced to imprisonment (the latter for forgery). The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete facts serving as grounds for the sentences passed on the first two trade unionists mentioned in order to enable it to determine whether or not these sentences were based on trade union activities.
.The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release to the ten trade union leaders and trade unionists and has also expressed its hope that the request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.
.With reference to the list of  trade unionists who were detained, tried or sentenced and in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused, the Committee observes that the Government has indicated in a general manner the acts which led to their trial, and has indicated that the activities of which they were accused were undertaken for the benefit of the Communist Party. The Committee observes that some of these activities have no connection whatsoever with freedom of association and that they constitute offences under ordinary law (possession of weapons, forging of documents, use of false identity documents, attacks with rocket launchers, attacks on commercial premises, etc.). However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities regardless of whether they were calculated to favour the objectives of the Communist Party. This would seem to be the case, for example, with the collection of monetary contributions and the printing and distribution of leaflets. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for having engaged in activities of a trade union character. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on this matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists and that it has also expressed the hope",0,1981,Uruguay
126,"that this request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.(b) With reference to the list of  trade unionists detained, tried or sentenced in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused, the Committee observes that the Government has indicated in a general manner the acts which led to their trial and that some of these activities have no connection whatsoever with freedom of association and constitute offences under ordinary law. However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for engaging in activities of a trade union character. It also requests that the Government supply information on this matter.
.The Committee notes with interest that, in accordance with its request, the Military Supreme Court granted the early release of the trade unionist Alberto Altesor, in view of his state of health.The Committee also notes the outcome of the inquiries carried out to ascertain the whereabouts of the dockworker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz. The Committee further notes that the trade unionists Jorge Luis Bessio, Neber Corral and Ral Lpez have been unconditionally released.
.The Committee notes that, in connection with its request to the Government to explain the facts which gave rise to the trial, sentencing and detention of the other  persons, the Government states that it has already provided full information in its present or former replies. In this respect, the Committee must point out that the Government merely listed the types of offences which the persons in question had allegedly committed. Most of the offences listed relate to ""subversive association"", ""conspiracy against the Constitution"" and other criminal actions, and there is no way of ascertaining if the detention, trial or sentencing of those concerned was linked to the exercise of trade union activities; the Committee therefore requests the Government once again to state the concrete facts leading to their arrest and to indicate whether they are still detained.
.Finally, the Committee recalls that it requested the Government to take measures to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Casas Rodrguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Belvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quintero Bethancourt) and to inform it of any action taken in this respect. As the Government has not submitted any information on this matter, the Committee can only reiterate its request.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with interest that, in accordance with its request, the Military Supreme Court has granted the early release of the trade unionist Alberto Altesor, in view of his state of health. The Committee also notes the outcome of the inquiries carried out by the authorities to ascertain the whereabouts of the dockworker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz. The Committee further notes that the trade unionists Jorge Luis Bessio, Neber Corral and Ral Lpez have been unconditionally released.(b) Although the Committee notes that the Government has stated the types of offences allegedly committed by the  trade unionists mentioned in the attached list, it requests the Government to indicate the concrete facts leading to their arrest so that it might ascertain if their detention, trial or sentencing was linked to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee asks the Government to supply information on the situation of these persons, in particular whether they are detained.(c) The Committee requests the Government once again to take measures to secure the release of the trade union leaders and trade unionists Alberto Casas Rodriguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt and to inform it of any action taken in this respect.
.The Committee examined these cases at its November  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Subsequently, the World Federation of Trade Unions sent additional information in communications dated  November and  December . The Government replied in communications dated  January,  February and  May .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee noted with interest that of the persons mentioned in the list of detained trade union leaders and trade unionists supplied by the CNT,  had been released and  did not appear on any records as having been arrested, and requested the Government for its observations regarding the  persons to whom it had not referred and to state the facts which had given rise to the trial or sentencing of the rest of persons on the list. As regards the alleged disappearance of trade unionists, the Committee requested the Government to make inquiries in order to ascertain the whereabouts of the dock worker trade unionist, Pedro Ortiz, and to inform it accordingly. The Committee also requested the Government to take measures to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Casas Rodriguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Benelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt) and to inform it of any action taken in this respect. It further requested the Government to keep it informed of any initiatives taken to apply measures of clemency regarding imprisoned trade unionists in poor health and, in particular, of any action taken regarding the application before the military courts for the early release of Mr. Alberto Altesor.
.In a communication dated  November , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) informed the Committee of the death of the trade union leader Ramn Freire Pizzano in the ""Libertad"" prison adding that, according to members of his family, his state of health had deteriorated as a result of ill treatment in the prison. In a subsequent communication, the WFTU stated that the news of this trade union leader's death was later denied by the same sources of information which had originally announced it.
.As regards the  trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CNT, about whom the Committee had requested the Government for its observations since it had not referred to them in its previous replies, the Government states that Celiar Reherman, Graciela Mario, Alcides Nez, Carlos Oxley, Ariel Fernndez Cirigliano and Enrique Rodriguez have been released, that there is no record of the detention of Miguel Carbajal, Miguel Garcia, Sergio Garcia, Alcibiades Techero and Felipe Vera, and that Carlos Tutzo (sentenced for subversive association), though he has not applied for an early release, will probably be released on  July . As regards the trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CNT about whom the Committee had requested the Government to state the facts giving rise to their trial or sentencing, the Government states that Ulises Pereira was released on  September, Odilio Rovira on  December and Bonito Alvario on  December . The Government also indicates the crimes for which the following persons were sentenced: Jos Bessio and Wilman Lasena (subversive association.), Rubn Bello and Miguel Angel Guzmn (subversive association and attack on the Constitution).
.The Government also states that, in order to demonstrate the false nature of the information supplied by the WFTU in its communication of  November , it invited various heads of diplomatic missions accredited in the country to visit the penitentiary in which Mr. Ramn Freire Pizzano is imprisoned; during the visit, which took place on  November , the heads of the diplomatic missions were able to verify the trade union leader's perfect state of health and the conditions in which he is serving his sentence.
.Lastly, the Government states that the application for the early release of Mr. Alberto Altesor is under study by the Military Supreme Court and, as requested of the competent authority, inquiries are being made to ascertain, the whereabouts of the dock worker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz. The Committee will be informed of the outcome.
.As regards the  trade union leaders and trade unionists alleged to have been detained according to the list supplied by the CNT, about whom the Government had not replied, the Committee notes with interest that, according to the Government, Celiar Reherman, Graciela Mario, Alcides Nez, Carlos Oxley, Ariel Fernndez Cirigliano and Enrique Rodriguez have been released, that there is no record of the detention of Miguel Carbajal, Miguel Garcia, Sergio Garcia, Alcibiades",-1,1981,Uruguay
127,"Techero and Felipe Vera, and that Carlos Tutzo, though he has not applied for an early release, will probably be released on  July .
.As regards the  trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CNT, about whom the Committee had requested the Government to state the facts giving rise to their detention, trial or sentencing, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Ulises Pereira, Odilio Rovira and Benito Alvario have been released. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet supplied the information requested about the remaining  trade union leaders and trade unionists. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to supply this information as soon as possible.
.As regards the allegation, subsequently denied by the WFTU, that the state of health of the trade union leader Ramn Freire Pizzano had deteriorated as a result of the ill treatment received in prison and that he had died, the Committee notes that the Government invited various heads of diplomatic missions accredited in the country to visit the penitentiary in which Mr. Freire Pizzano is imprisoned and that these diplomats were able to verify the trade union leader's state of health and the conditions in which he is serving his sentence.
.Concerning the allegations in connection with which the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of further developments, the Committee notes that the Government has ordered inquiries to be made in order to ascertain the whereabouts of the dock worker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz, that it will be informed of the outcome of the inquiries and that the application for the early release of the trade unionist Alberto Altesor is now under study by the Military Supreme Court. The Committee expresses the hope that, in view of this trade unionist's delicate state of health, the Count will decide on his early release shortly, and requests the Government to communicate the text of the decision taken. The committee also recalls that it requested the Government to take measures to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Casas Rodriquez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson: Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt) and to inform it of any action taken in this respect. Since the Government has not supplied any information on the matter, the Committee can only reiterate its conclusions.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with interest that certain trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CWT have been released and that another trade unionist will probably be released on  July .(b) The Committee requests the Government to explain, as soon as' possible, the facts which gave rise to the trial, sentencing or detention of the  trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the attached list of detained persons supplied by the CNT.(c) The Committee notes that the trade union leader Ramn Freire Pizzano has not died and that, according to the Government, he is in perfect health at the penitentiary where he is serving his sentence.(d) The Committee notes that the Government has ordered inquiries to be made to ascertain the whereabouts of the dock worker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz and will inform the Committee of the outcome.(e) The Committee expresses the hope that, in view of the delicate state of health of the trade unionist Alberto Altesor, the Court will decide on his early release shortly. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the text of the decision taken.(f) The Committee again requests the Government to take measures to secure the release of the trade union leaders and trade unionists Alberto Casas Rodriguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt and to inform it of any action taken in this respect.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the National Workers Convention of Uruguay (CNT) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), dated  December  and ,  and  January  respectively. The WFTU, the CNT and the ICFTU sent supplementary information in communications dated  February,  April and  August  respectively. The Government furnished its reply in communications dated  May,  October and  November .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (NO. ).
.The complainants allege that the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU), a trade union set up in accordance with the provisions of the Act respecting occupational associations and the decree regulating the application thereof was obliged to obtain permission from the Police Headquarters in Montevideo to organise its first assembly. The complainants add that, on  December , some participants of this assembly were apprehended by the police and subjected to interrogation, and that tape recordings were made of the proceedings and taken away by officials of the Ministry of the Interior.
.The complainants also allege the arbitrary arrest by the police of Jos d'Elia (President of the CNT), Carlos Gmez (ex-President of the AEBU and ex-Vice-President of the CNT), Bernardo Groisman (ex-leader of the Needleworkers Union), who have since been released, and the arrest of the trade unionists Luis Viera, Roberto Meirelles, Nicols Llad, Rubn Onelli Arias, Alberto Ortiz and Rubn Pereira.
.The complainants further allege the arrest of Ramn Freire Pizzano (member of the National Board of the CNT), Elbio Quinteros (leader of the Municipal Workers and Employees Union of Montevideo), Helvecio Bonelli (leader of the Uruguayan Press Association and member of the National Board of the CNT), Alberto Urruty (local Committee delegate of the Omnibus Workers Organisation), Nelson Cuello (trade unionist working at the oil refinery of the State undertaking ANCAP), Gene Mateos Calvete (worker at the ANCAP oil refinery), Daniel Uriarte (member of the local trade union management board of ANCAP), Armando Coronel (member of the local Committee of public health), Alberto Casas Rodriguez (bank employee and trade union delegate at his workplace) and Umberto Bonelli (bank employee). According to the complainants, a statement from the Police Headquarters of Montevideo dated  January  maintained that this group was a trade union splinter of the Communist Party and accused the group of seeking to organise legal trade unions by drawing membership from workers who were not known to be communists which would enable the establishment of a legal movement secretly directed by the Communist Party and the revival of the CNT which had been declared illegal. The statement in question indicates that the ten persons were brought before a military court which tried them for offences committed under section  of the Military Penal Code (""Subversive Associations""), section (L)() in conjunction with section  (XII) of the Constitution (""Conspiracy against the Constitution followed by preparatory acts"") and section  (IV) of the Military Penal Code """"Assistance to illegal associations""). The complainants go on to allege that the political and ideological repression of all opponents of the Government extends to the trade union movement and in this way the police can accuse a group of workers of belonging to any ""antinational"", ""subversive"" ideology if they commit the so-called ""crime"" of trying to organise legal trade unions and it may bring them before a military court.
.Furthermore, the CNT encloses a list of trade union leaders and trade unionists who are currently in prison (see Annex), and the WFTU points out that since the promulgation of the decree regulating the Act respecting occupational associations, approximately  trade unionists have disappeared, including the dockworker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz subsequent to his arrest.
.Finally, the complainants point out that some trade union leaders and trade unionists who are serving prison sentences in the ""Libertad"" penitentiary are seriously ill and refer in particular to Hugo Rodrguez, Jos Pedro Mrquez and Alberto Altesor. The family of the last-mentioned prisoner has requested his transfer to Argentina to undergo a medical operation.
.In a further communication dated  August , the ICFTU states that Mr. Altesor was allowed to undergo a heart operation, attended by his own doctor, in July . The operation was successful and his health is now improving. The ICFTU requests that he be released from detention on humanitarian grounds.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that the fact that it is sending information on the various complaints does not imply its recognition of the legal capacity of those who claim to be spokesmen of the ""National Workers Convention of Uruguay"", an association which was declared illegal by the Government on  June  because of its activities unrelated to trade unionism",-1,1981,Uruguay
128,"and its support of the terrorist movement.
.The Government states that the convening of the first assembly of the AEBU was expressly authorised by the Police Headquarters of Montevideo, that approximately  persons participated in the assembly and that no arrests were made or interrogations carried out.
.As regards the allegations concerning arrested trade unionists, the Government supplies the following information on the persons concerned:- d'Elia, Jos Artigas: Although his arrest was ordered by requisition No.  dated  July  of the Defence Information Service for having conspired against the Government and the institutions of the country, his arrest has not yet been registered and therefore the accounts made to the contrary are totally false.- Gmez Perrotti, Carlos Adolfo: Arrested and interned under the emergency security measures (Constitution, section , para. ) on  October ; released on  January .

.With regard to the allegation concerning the disappearance of approximately  trade unionists, the Government states that although it has always made every effort to reply to the complaints which have been presented, this is impossible in the present allegation since no names or concrete information have been provided. The Government adds that the name of Pedro Ortiz Larrechen - who according to the complainants disappeared after his arrest - does not appear in the register of arrested persons. The Government states that the medical attention for persons prosecuted in the military courts who require specialist attention is provided by the Central Hospital of the Armed Forces, a model hospital centre offering the services of the best specialists and full medical care, which is identical for both prisoners and military personnel and their families. The Government confirms the weak health of Hugo Rodriguez, Jos Pedro Mrquez and Alberto Altesor and states that they are receiving proper medical attention with reference in particular to the last-mentioned person, the Government points out that this prisoner was examined in November  at the request of his family by the Argentinian doctor, Rene Favaloro, who in consultation with a medical team from the Central Hospital recorded a series of abnormalities which were believed to be operable. They recommended cardio-coronary examinations which were carried out on  January  with the following results: the aorta valve has biological prosthesis and severe paraprosthetic insufficiencies; an  per cent lesion of the first third of the coronary artery descending from behind with calibre open to two-thirds; and an insufficiency of the left ventricle with serious venocapillary and pulmonary hypertension. Since the prisoner in question, indicated in a note that he had decided not to be operated on before consulting the members of his family and his attending physician, the request for transfer was approved. Recently, with the consent of his treating physician and family, Mr. Altesor underwent a second operation from which he is presently recuperating. Lastly, the Government states that the permission to release Mr. Altesor ahead of time rests with the military courts.
.Finally, in its communication of  November , the Government sends information on the majority of the persons mentioned in the list of detained persons sent by the CNT (see Annex). The Government states in particular that not all the persons referred to by the CNT are detained and that those who are detained have been tried in conformity with the law for illegal acts and not because of their trade union activities or their links with occupational organisations. The Government also gives the offences with which they were charged and sentenced.
.The Committee notes that the complainants in the present case have made allegations concerning the arrest, prosecution or disappearance of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the state of health of other persons serving prison sentences and events which allegedly took place during the first assembly of the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay.
.With regard to this last-mentioned point, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, no arrests or interrogations were made at this assembly. The Committee observes, however, that the complainants allege that the AEBU had to request authorisation from the Police Headquarters in Montevideo to hold the assembly and that the Government appears to confirm this in its statements. The Committee also notes that, according to the complainants, officials of",-1,1981,Uruguay
129,"the Ministry of the Interior took away a tape recording of the proceedings of the assembly and that the Government has not replied to this point. In this respect the Committee would draw the attention of the Government to the fact that, under Article . of Convention No. , the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict or impede the lawful exercise of the right of workers organisations to organise their administration and activities. The Committee would point out in particular that the right of trade union organisations to meet freely in their own premises without the need for any prior authorisation and without any form of control by the authorities constitutes a fundamental element of freedom of association.,
.As regards the allegation concerning the arrest of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Jos d'Ela has not been arrested and that no record appears of the arrest of Nicols Llad and Rubn Onelli. The Committee also notes that Carlos Gmez and Bernardo Groisman have now been released. In this connection, since it is not in possession of sufficient information to determine the circumstances in which the arrest of these two persons took place, the Committee would recall that the preventive detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists and measures of preventive detention in general constitute a serious danger to trade union freedom and may involve a serious interference in trade union activities.
.The Committee observes furthermore that some trade union leaders continue to be held in detention and have been tried for offences concerning ""Subversive Associations"", ""Conspiracy against the Constitution followed by preparatory acts"" and ""Aid to the Associations"". The persons in question are Luis Viera, Roberto Meirelles, Alberto Ortiz Feij, Rubn Pereira, Alberto Casas Rodriguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Baez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt.
.With regard to the first four persons, the Committee notes that the complainants simply allege their arrest without providing any further information on the circumstances in which the arrests occurred and, in particular, without demonstrating the alleged relationship between the trade union status or activities of these persons and their arrest. In these circumstances, and in the absence of more detailed information from the complainants, the Committee can only take note of the offences which the persons allegedly committed and recall the general importance of the principle mentioned above.
.With regard to the other ten trade union leaders and trade unionists arrested and brought before the military courts, the Committee notes that the Government has not referred to the alleged exercise of trade union activities by these persons and that it would appear from the statements made that at least the majority of these persons were arrested in connection with the dismantling of a propaganda centre of the illegal Communist Party. The Committee notes, however, that, according to the statement issued by the Police Headquarters in Montevideo to which the complainants make reference, the persons in question were arrested and tried because the group was a trade union splinter of the Communist Party which sought to organise legal trade unions in order to establish a legal movement which would be secretly directed by the Communist Party with a view to the possible reorganisation of the CNT which had been declared illegal. In this connection, the Committee must recall that when previous allegations have been submitted concerning measures of a political nature - such as the prohibition of the Communist Party - which may indirectly involve interference with the exercise of trade union rights, it has drawn attention to the right of workers without distinction whatsoever to set up and join trade unions of their own choosing. The public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures towards the release of the trade union leaders and trade unionists in question and to inform it of any action taken in this respect.
.The Committee notes the information sent by the Government on the CNT list of detained trade union leaders and trade unionists, and in particular that the detained persons have been tried for illegal activities and not because of their trade union activities or links with occupational organisations. The Committee notes with interest that  have been released and that  do not appear on any records as having been detained. Nevertheless, the Committee observes that the Government does not send any information on  persons and that the rest - concerning whom the Government gives the offences with which they were charged - are being tried or have been sentenced. As these persons are all trade union leaders or trade unionists, the Committee requests the Government to indicate the facts which gave rise to the trial or sentencing so that it can decide on this aspect of the case in full knowledge of the facts.
.With regard to the alleged disappearance of  trade unionists, the Committee observes that the complainants have indicated only the name of Pedro Ortiz. In this respect the Committee takes note of the statement of the Government that the name of Pedro Ortiz does not appear on the register of arrested persons and that it is impossible to reply to an allegation concerning disappearances when no names or concrete information are provided. The Committee requests the Government to make inquiries with a view to ascertaining the whereabouts of the dockworker trade unionist, Pedro Ortiz, and to inform the Committee accordingly.
.As concerns the trade union leaders and trade unionists Hugo Rodriguez, Jos Pedro Mrquez and Alberto Altesor, who are serving prison 'sentences in the ""Libertad"" penitentiary and who are seriously ill, the Committee takes note of the assurances given by the Government concerning the medical attention which they are receiving. The Committee observes in particular that the services of the best specialists are available at the military hospital where they are being treated, that medical attention is identical for prisoners and for military personnel and their families and that Alberto Altesor has now undergone a heart operation, attended by his own doctor, and that his health is now improving. The Committee also notes that permission for the anticipated release of Mr. Altesor rests with the military courts,
.Finally, the Committee must make the general observation that many trade unionists continue to be imprisoned. The Committee is convinced that any initiative undertaken by the Government with a view to applying measures of clemency, in particular as regards trade unionists who have been sentenced to prison terms and who are in poor health, will make a positive contribution to the establishment of a climate of confidence which is indispensable for the normalisation of trade union activity in the country and the effective exercise of trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken in this connection and, in particular, of the result of the application before the military courts for the anticipated release of Mr. Alberto Altesor.",-1,1981,Uruguay

.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that Decree No. / of  October , made under Act No.  respecting occupational associations, contains provisions contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the application of Decree No. / of  October , made under Act No.  respecting occupational associations, has made it possible to initiate the procedure for setting up more than  occupational associations, besides those which are already in operation.
.The Government adds that, in any amendments that may be made to the Decree, account will be taken of any comments made by the supervisory bodies of the International Labour Organisation.
.The Committee notes that the complainants have questioned the conformity of the provisions of Decree No. / of  October  (made under Act No.  respecting occupational associations) with the principles of freedom of association.
.In this respect, the Committee observes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, at its March  session, examined the provisions of Decree No. / of  October , and formulated an observation pointing out that the Decree contained some provisions which are not in conformity with Convention No. , regarding, in particular, election or re-election to trade union office, affiliation to federations and Confederations, etc. The Committee of Experts expressed the hope that the rules governing the right to strike would be adopted as soon as possible and that the Government would shortly take the necessary measures for ensuring the full application of the Convention.
.The Committee endorses the comments made by the Committee of Experts on Decree No. / of  October  and expresses the hope that the Government will shortly take the necessary measures for the full application of Convention No. . In this respect, the Committee notes the Government's statement that, in any amendment that may be made to the Decree, account will be taken of any comments made by the supervisory bodies of the ILO.

131,".The complaint is contained in communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  June and  and  September . The Government replied in communications dated  October  and  February .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that some of the provisions of Act No.  respecting occupational associations, promulgated on  May , violate the principles of freedom of association and the relevant ILO Conventions.
.Furthermore, in its communication of  September , the ICFTU alleges that the trade union leader Gerardo Cuesta, former Secretary-General of the National Workers' Convention (CNT) who had been imprisoned in  for his trade union activities, was transferred from the prison to the military hospital in an extremely serious condition without any steps being taken to release him and see that he could receive proper medical care. In a subsequent communication of  September , the ICFTU states that Gerardo Cuesta died on  September .
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that the competent bodies of the ILO (Committee on Freedom of Association, Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, and the Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Conference) have already examined the allegations by the complainant organisation relating to the occupational Associations Act and made recommendations on the subject.
.As regards the death of Mr. Gerardo Cuesta, the Government states that the medical examinations made in due course showed that Mr. Gerardo Cuesta already had, at the time of entering the prison, a medical record of chronic bronchitis. Subsequently he suffered from severe attacks of bronchitis and decompensated heart failure was observed; in each instance he received adequate treatment, from time to time remaining under medical surveillance in the polyclinic. The Government adds that Mr. Gerardo Cuesta did not lack the necessary medical care at any time. After his condition had become worse in  with the development of abscesses of the upper and middle right lobes of the lung, he was operated on in September of that year. He died during the operation as a result of heart and lung failure.
.As regards the occupational Associations Act in force, the Committee recalls that it reached definitive conclusions on the matter in its th Report, in which it observed with satisfaction that, as a result of the direct contacts carried out, significant improvements had been introduced into the provisions of the Hill on which the Committee had made comments; it pointed out that some provisions were not in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association and referred to certain omissions in the text of the Act, which it trusted would be dealt with by other legislative measures. Consequently, the Committee drew this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations so that it might continue its examination. In these circumstances, having already examined the Occupational Associations Act at its May  Session and having on that occasion reached its conclusions on the substance of the matter, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination on its part.
.As regards the allegation concerning the death of the former Secretary-General of the CNT, Mr. Gerardo Cuesta, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Mr. Cuesta did not lack the necessary medical care at any time during his sentence and that he died during a surgical operation as a result of heart and lung failure. In this respect, the Committee can only deeply regret the death of Mr. Gerardo Cuesta, and the fact that the competent authorities did not consider the possibility of releasing him sooner.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) As regards the allegation concerning the Occupational Associations Act, the Committee, having already examined this Act at its May  Session and having reached its conclusions on the substance of the matter, considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination on its part.(b) As regards the allegation concerning the former Secretary-General of the CNT, Mr. Gerardo Cuesta, the Committee, while noting that he did not lack the necessary medical care at any time, deeply regrets his death and the fact that the competent authorities did not consider the possibility of releasing him sooner.",0,1981,Uruguay
132,".The last time the Committee considered these cases was at its meeting in November , when it submitted a report on them (rd Report, paragraphs  to ). This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session in November .
.After analysing the information available to it through the direct contacts procedure used in these cases, the Committee took the view that, in view of the nature of the case it would be appropriate and desirable for it to continue to follow developments in the trade union situation in Uruguay, and the effect given to its own recommendations, in accordance with the procedure in force. It accordingly recommended the Governing Body to invite the Government to submit full information before the Governing Body's Session in February  with regard to the action already taken or contemplated with a view to complying with the Committee's recommendations, and to forward its observations on the questions and allegations still outstanding.
.The Government sent two communications dated  January  in answer to this request, and in response to new complaints made by various complainant organisations.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In view of all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret that, in spite of the statement made by the Minister of Labour in June , the Government has still taken no practical steps to restore the trade union situation to normal, so that the workers' occupational organisations and their members can benefit properly from the safeguards and fully exercise the rights set forth in the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay;(b) to reaffirm the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , namely that ""workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority"";(c) while noting the release of several workers and trade unionists previously detained, to draw the Government's attention to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above and, in particular, to the danger involved for trade union rights when trade unionists are arrested and no grounds for conviction are subsequently found;(d) to take note of the information supplied by the Government about certain of the trade unionists detained, and to request the Government for the information still outstanding, and especially for the decisions taken with regard to the persons concerned, together with copies of the judgments rendered, with the reasons adduced;(e) to take note of the Government's statement concerning the allegations of ill-treatment, to reaffirm the importance of issuing specific instructions on the subject for the primary purpose of preventing any possible practices of this kind, and to request the Government for the information mentioned in paragraph  above;(f) to ask the Government for its detailed comments on the occupation and searching of trade union premises, referred to in paragraph  above;(g) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the information requested.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association has been examining various complaints alleging breaches of trade union rights in Uruguay, presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Confederation of Labour, the Uruguayan National Workers' Convention, the Latin American Workers' Confederation, the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers, the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Public Services and Allied Occupations, the Trades Union International of Workers in the Metal Industries, the World Federation of Teachers' Unions, the Latin American Federation of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, the International Federation of Actors, the Uruguayan Medical Trade Union and the Montevideo Bus Company. Almost all these complaints are combined in Case No. , regarding which the Committee has submitted four interim reports to the Governing Body which appear in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report. These reports were approved by the Governing Body at its meetings of November , February-March , November  and March , respectively.
.In the latter of these reports, the Committee pointed out that it was confronted with a situation which raises important problems in relation to various basic principles of freedom of association and which seems to affect a large section of the trade union movement in Uruguay. The Committee also noted that new complaints were still being presented regarding the trade union situation in Uruguay and that the information supplied by the complainants and by the Government was largely contradictory. In these circumstances, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government's agreement, in accordance with the procedure for direct contacts previously adopted by the Committee in another country, for the appointment by the Director-General of a representative to examine, in Uruguay, the facts relating to the complaint and to report thereon to the Committee. This recommendation having been adopted by the Governing Body, the Uruguayan Government gave its consent in communications dated  and  May .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Philippe Cahier, Professor in the Institut universitaire de hautes tudes internationales in Geneva, who carried out his mission from  June to  July , accompanied by an official of the International Labour Office.
.The Committee studied the report presented by the Director-General's representative and noted, in particular, that he had received all the facilities necessary for the fulfilment of his mission in Uruguay and that he had been able to have many talks, especially with the authorities and with leaders of workers' and employers' organisations, including detained leaders. Before visiting the country, the Director-General's representative had interviews with Uruguayan governmental, employers' and workers' delegates attending the th Session of the International Labour Conference and with leaders of the National Workers' Convention living outside Uruguay.

Thus, the Committee notes that the following provisions of the Bill were deleted: the obligation to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" in order to be eligible as a trade union leader; the obligatory voting in elections and plebiscites; the limitation of the maximum duration of trade union assemblies; the obligatory organisation of a plebiscite to examine draft collective agreements and in other cases provided for by regulations; and suspension of membership of those who have not taken part in a vote. The Committee also notes that the new Act limits the broad powers of the authorities to require reports on trade union activities, and that the lower-level trade unions are not responsible for decisions taken by higher-level organisations to which they are affiliated. The Committee trusts that the Government will take measures to ensure that the legislation will recognise explicitly the possibility of forming occupational associations at the occupational and the industrial levels, and to repeal the requirement, in certain cases, of two years' membership of a trade union as a condition of eligibility to trade union office. The Committee trusts also that the regulations to be issued under the Act will be in full conformity with the obligations arising under the freedom of association Conventions ratified by Uruguay and that other legislative measures will deal with the exercise of the right to strike and will ensure the protection of trade union leaders against any act of anti-union discrimination. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case, so that it may continue to examine it.In relation to the detentions alleged by the complainants, the Committee notes with interest that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainant have already been released, and that during the last few years the number of detainees has been reduced, as has - to a marked extent - the number of new detentions followed by prosecution. Nevertheless, the Committee must also note that in almost all the cases the defence was entrusted to a member of the military. When the representative of the Director-General referred to appeals, he stated that a slight tendency to increase the sentences handed down at first instance could be noted.In view of the time which has elapsed since the majority of the detainees and convicted persons were deprived of their freedom, the Committee considers that their release would be a necessary condition for the harmonious development of labour relations. It therefore requests the Government to take measures for the release of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants still in prison and asks the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard.As regards the other allegations:The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that assets of dissolved organisations should be distributed between the members of the organisation or transferred to the organisations which succeed them.The Committee asks the Government to re-examine the situation of the workers dismissed in January  from the Clnicas Hospital, with a view to reinstating those whose dismissal was based on trade union activities.The Committee trusts that, the occupational Associations Act having been approved, the AEBU, as well as the rest of the organisations concerned, will be able to regain legal personality shortly.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, chairman.
.In its previous examinations of the case, the Committee has stressed the abnormal character of the situation for the Uruguayan trade union movement as a whole since the change of regime which took place in June . Uruguayan trade unions cannot carry out the activities proper to such unions because their recognition by the authorities and by the employers hinges upon their legal status - and that status has not yet been defined by law: they thus have an existence in fact but not legally.
.The Committee had examined the preliminary draft of the law on occupational associations, the text of which had been forwarded to it by the Government. It noted that this text contained some positive aspects, but it formulated observations concerning a number of other provisions of the draft which did not seem compatible with certain principles of freedom of association, On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, at its session of May-June , took note of the Government's statement to the effect that these observations would be taken into consideration in the preparation of the final text of the draft to be submitted to the Council of State and that the Government was carrying out consultations on this draft with worker and employer organisations.
.At its November  Session, the Committee noted, in particular, that the comments made by the ILO supervisory organs were being examined, that the final draft of the Act was due to be submitted to the Council of State by  December  and that the Government would suggest that it be examined rapidly. The Committee reiterated that, after six years of serious restrictions upon trade union activities, there was a very urgent need to promulgate and implement legislation which recognises the right for all workers, without any distinction whatsoever, to set up occupational organisations and the right of these organisations to function and operate freely, in accordance with the various Conventions on freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation:- expressed the firm hope that this draft, in its final version, would be in full conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  which have been ratified by Uruguay, urged the Government to adopt it in the very near future and asked the Government to give the date on which it was envisaged that it would be promulgated;- asked the Government to send the draft Act once it was submitted to the Council of State and to supply information on any developments which might take place.
.In its communication of  December , the Government informed the International Labour Office of the publication on  December  in the Official Journal, of the message by which the executive branch submitted the draft law on occupational associations to the Council of State. The Government draws attention to the importance attached, in its message to the Council of State, to the rapid examination of the draft so that the situation of occupational associations could be regularised as soon as possible. It attached to its communication the text of the message and of the draft.
.The CNT and the WFTU have made allegations concerning the draft in their communications of  January and  February , respectively. They refer in particular to the provisions concerning the conditions of eligibility of trade union leaders, the by-laws of organisations and the grounds for refusal of registration. The CNT considers that, having compared this draft with the previous one, which the Committee has already examined, the present draft is even more negative for trade union organisations.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that the ILO's comments on the draft law were examined most attentively and as a matter of high priority. In this connection, the Government recalls that it included in the guidelines of the draft the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations. It also notes that in the draft the absolute restriction upon the exercise of political activities has been weakened. The Government states that in relation to the Committee's suggestions which have not been incorporated into the draft, they only concerned different interpretations and not non-performance of Convention No.
.While examining the complainants' allegations, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is at present examining the draft law on the exercise of the right to strike. The Government also notes that even if they are not covered by the Legislative Decree, civil servants enjoy the right to form trade unions, particularly under the terms of the Public Service Act of .
.Regarding the right to form organisations without previous authorisation, the Government notes that the International Court of Justice has given no interpretation on this point and therefore this question remains open to discussion. Referring to the principles already set out by the Committee, the Government states that it shares the opinion of the Committee on this point. According to the Government, the draft does not give discretionary power to public authorities regarding legislation of trade unions. The possible reasons for refusal of registration are defined in the draft, and, in addition, any decision by the administrative authority can be appealed before the courts.
.Finally, the Government states that its reply does",0,1973,Uruguay
138,"not imply the ""de jure"" recognition of one of the complainants which holds itself out to be the spokesmen for the National Convention of Workers of Uruguay, an organisation which was declared illegal by the Government on  June .
.As for the Committee, it has examined the draft law on occupational associations and notes that this draft is very similar to the previous draft, which the Committee examined at its February  Session. In these circumstances, the Committee regrets that most of the comments which it made at that time have not been taken into consideration in preparing the present draft. The Committee considers it necessary to recall certain principles and considerations which it put forward when it examined the earlier draft, concerning the provisions which have been retained in the present draft.
.As regards the establishment of organisations, the Committee stressed that workers should be free to decide whether they prefer to establish, at the primary level, a works union. - the only possibility allowed under the draft, except for certain exceptions based on the number of workers - or another form of basic organisation, such as an industrial or craft union. In this connection, the Committee observes that section  of the draft always situates the officers of the primary trade union in the undertaking, and that in addition section  allows the organisation of occupational associations of workers, of office workers, of technicians or of executive personnel. It is not clear whether the latter provision, which was not included in the earlier draft, would allow the establishment of organisations according to occupational categories grouping several undertakings or whether it would otherwise be impossible to establish trade unions at the works level which would include all the workers belonging to different categories of wage-earners. Generally, the Committee considers that provisions limiting a trade union's possible sphere of activity may constitute a violation of the right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing, as required by Article  of Convention No. .
.With regard to the conditions of eligibility of trade union leaders, the Committee recalls that the obligation laid on these leaders to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" may give rise to abuses. The draft still does not state what specific acts are considered to constitute breaches of faith in democracy and thus renders effective legal supervision of the application of this provision impossible. In addition, under sections  and  of the draft read in conjunction, trade union officials must have belonged to the branch of activity represented by the union for at least two years, which, in the Committee's opinion, imposes restrictions on the right of workers freely to elect their trade union representatives.
.As did the earlier draft, this draft regulates in considerable detail the various aspects of the internal administration of trade unions obligatory voting in elections and plebiscites (sections (d) and ); supply of reports on trade union activities whenever authorities so request (section (a)); maximum time limit for trade union assemblies (section ); obligatory organisation of plebiscite to examine draft collective agreements and in other cases provided for by regulations (section ); suspension of the membership of a member who has not taken part in a vote (section ); lower-level trade unions are responsible for decisions taken by higher-level organisations to which they are affiliated, except in specific cases provided for in the draft (section ); public votes in cases of associations of the second and third levels (section ); at the time of elections and plebiscites various formalities must be complied with at the Ministry of Labour (section ).
.The Committee has recalled, with regard to these provisions, that Convention No.  guarantees in particular the rights of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. The Committee must emphasise once again the importance which it attaches to these standards and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any intervention which would limit these -rights or impede their legal exercise.
.The Committee notes with interest that the provision of the previous draft which forbade any reference to politics in the by-laws of the organisations has been modified. Under section  of the draft, only activities which have a preponderantly political character are forbidden. The Committee considers that the conformity of this provision with the principles of freedom of association will depend essentially on the practical application of this provision.
.At various stages in the examination of this case, the Committee has examined allegations concerning the detention of trade unionists and former trade unionists (whose names, and in many cases their trade union functions, had been indicated in the complaints). On several occasions, in particular in May , the Committee attached to its report the information furnished by the Government on the trade unionists concerned. At its sessions of May-June and November , the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation noted the release of a certain number of trade unionists mentioned by the complainants.
.In a letter of May , the WFTU referred to the precarious state of health of two detained trade unionists, Rosario Pietraroia and Gerardo Cuesta. The WFTU also stated that contrary to previous statements by the Government, Oscar Tassino Atz (trade union leader of the AUTE) had disappeared after his arrest on  July , and stated that members of his family witnessed the arrest. The CNT, in a letter of September , stated its concern over the conditions of detention of several trade union leaders (under-nourishment, absence of medical care and inadequate sanitary arrangements, absence of medication, ill-treatment and repression). It cited in particular the case of Rosario Pietraroia who has lost one eye for lack of the necessary care.
.At the beginning of the Committee's November  Session, the Government communicated a certain amount of information on the situation of trade unionists listed in the annex to the Committee's th Report. The Committee proposed to examine this information at its following session. The Governing Body also requested the Government to communicate its observations concerning the allegations relative to the conditions of detention and to the situation of a certain number of arrested trade unionists.
.In its communication of  December , the WFTU again referred to the situation of the metal industry trade union leader, Gerardo Cuesta, detained since , who was sentenced to  years' imprisonment and has been ill treated.
.Regarding Gerardo Cuesta, the Government recalls in its communication of  February  that he was arrested and imprisoned under emergency security measures (section () of the Constitution). He was charged in August  before the military investigating magistrate for subversive activity and violation of the Constitution with ""conspiracy and preparatory action"". Gerardo Cuesta was sentenced to  years' imprisonment in August . The sentence was confirmed in October . Regarding his state of health, the Government states that he suffers from chronic bronchial pneumonia which dates from before his arrest with periodical crises which are supervised and cared for. Nevertheless, his state of health is good. The Government states that Gerardo Cuesta was not sentenced because of his trade union activity.
.In its communication of  January , the Government supplied certain information according to which several of the persons mentioned by the complainants have been released.
.The Committee notes that, according to the information communicated by the Government several trade unionists have been released. It also notes the information provided by the Government regarding Gerardo Cuesta. However, it must express its concern over the fact that several persons mentioned by the complainants are still waiting, and in several cases have been for a considerable time, to be tried by the courts. In this connection, the Committee stresses the importance which it attaches to the principle that any person arrested should be subject to normal judicial procedure and should be brought before the appropriate judge without delay, in accordance with the principles enshrined in the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In the case of persons who carry out trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which must be assured by the authorities in order to guarantee the effective exercise of trade union rights. The Committee hopes that the Government will continue to supply information on the situation of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants and that it will communicate its observations on the conditions of detention of trade union leaders.
.In its letter of May , the WFTU pointed out that the number of joint Committees actually functioning was far below that indicated by the Government in may  and that the authorities were even trying to hinder their establishment. The complainant mentioned two specific instances (the ""Aurora"" textile factory and the ""Banco Comercial"") and added that in certain cases workers who requested the setting up of such Committees were being subjected to pressure and persecution.
.The WFTU further stated that trade union premises had been closed, thus depriving the trade unions and their leaders of their means of action, and that government",0,1973,Uruguay
139,"bodies had occupied the premises in question. The WFTU mentioned the case of the National Trade Union of Construction Workers and Allied Trades (SUNCA), whose premises had apparently become the barracks of the grenadier guards, of the National Union of Workers in the Metal and Allied Trades (UNTMICA) whose premises had apparently become the headquarters of Police section , of the National Workers' Convention (CNT), whose premises had apparently become a centre for the women police of Montevideo (and whose equipment was being used by Department No.  of the police), the case of the Meat Workers' Federation, the use of whose premises had been requested by the Montevideo police commissioner of Section No. , the case of the Federation of Primary Schoolteachers' Unions and that of the secondary Schoolteachers' Trade Union, whose premises had also apparently become paramilitary installations.
.The WFTU emphasised that all trade union activities had been suppressed six years before, and that the experience with joint commissions had been negative. It drew particular attention to the numerous dismissals continuously, taking place on the basis of Institutional Act No.  ( members of the staff of the Clnicas Hospital were thus dismissed in January ). The WFTU concluded that these dilatory tactics, used in expectation of the complete suppression of all attempts at free trade union activity, showed the illusory character of the promise of trade union freedom.
.For its part, the CRT alleged in a letter of September , that the police headquarters of Montevideo had notified the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) on  July  that its legal personality was ""without effect"", in accordance with Decree No. / of  August . The complainant added that the deduction from wages of the trade union dues of the AEBU members had been discontinued. It also quoted a decision of the Ministry of the Interior (dated  July ) ordering the president of AEBU to hand over within  days to the National Office of Information and Research a list of members of a new governing board consisting of persons having no ""adverse past records"", so that the authorities could, upon request, later allow artistic and cultural events to take place under the supervision of the above-mentioned National Office. The CRT further alleged that pressure was being exerted on the workers, even those who were under arrest, to make them join together in a nationalist trade union. At the time of the Committee's November  Session, the Government had not yet replied to these new allegations. The Governing Body then requested the Government to transmit its observations on these points. The Government has still not replied to the allegations in question.
.In its communication of  January , the Government supplies comments on these various allegations. The Committee intends to examine them at its next session.
.As regards the case as a whole, more generally, the Committee has empowered its chairman to examine with the representatives of the Government of Uruguay at the Governing Body the most appropriate means of arriving at a rapid and satisfactory solution of the questions raised.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the draft Act on occupational associations:(i) to note with concern that the draft differs only slightly from the earlier draft which the Committee examined at its May  Session;(ii) to draw the Government's attention yet again to the principles and considerations set out in paragraphs  to  above regarding provisions on the free establishment of trade unions, the conditions of eligibility of trade union leaders and the regulation of various aspects of the internal administration of trade unions;(iii) to express the firm hope that these principles and considerations will be taken into account in the final text of the Act;(iv) to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of any development in the matter;(b) regarding the detention of trade unionists:(i) to note with interest that certain trade unionists have been released;(ii) nevertheless to express its concern over the fact that certain persons are waiting, in some cases for a considerable time, to be tried by the courts and to call the attention of the Government to the principles set out in paragraph , in particular the principle according to which all persons arrested should be subject to normal judicial procedure and should be brought before the appropriate judge without delay;(iii) to request the Government to continue to supply information on the situation of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants;(c) to note that the Government has just supplied certain comments regarding the other allegations and that the Committee intends to examine them at its next session;(d) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.For a number of years, the Committee has had occasion to examine several complaints dealing with different aspects of the trade union situation in the country. It has stressed the abnormal character of this situation for the Uruguayan trade union movement as a whole, ever since the change of regime which took place in June . It is a fact that Uruguayan trade unions cannot carry out the activities proper to such unions because their recognition by the authorities and by the employers hinges upon their legal status - and that status has not yet been defined by law: they thus have an existence in fact but not legally.
.The Government has referred on more than one occasion to the subversive activities which it had to face, in order to explain the exceptional measures adopted, particularly in regard to trade unions. The Committee has recalled, in this connection, the need to avoid confusing the performance by trade unions of their own specific activities, that is to say the defence and promotion of the professional interests of the workers, with the possible conduct by some of their members of other activities, foreign to the trade union field. The liability at penal law which might attach to these persons as a result of such acts should in no case lead to measures calculated to deprive the trade unions themselves, or their leaders as a body, of their freedom of action. The Government has also stated that the process of normalisation in the trade union field must be viewed in the wider framework of the political and institutional normalisation of the country as a whole. In this connection, the Committee has stressed that while it is true that the respect of trade union freedom is closely connected with the respect of public liberties in general, it is important, subject to that reservation, to draw a clear distinction between the recognition of freedom of association on the one hand and questions relating to the political evolution of the country concerned on the other. The trade union legislation of a country and the reform of its political institutions are two totally distinct questions.
.The Committee has examined the preliminary draft of the law on professional associations, the text of which had been forwarded to it by the Government. It notes that this text contains some positive aspects, but it has formulated observations concerning a number of other provisions of the draft which do not seem compatible with some of the principles of freedom of association, on the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, at its session of May-June , took note of the Government's statement to the effect that these observations will be taken into consideration in the preparation of the final text of the draft to be submitted to the Council of State and that the Government was carrying out consultations on this draft with worker and employer organisations. The Governing Body stressed how important it was that the law thus being drafted should be promulgated very shortly and that its final text should be in complete harmony with the rules embodied in ILO Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Uruguay. It urged the Government to indicate the date on which it expects the final text of the law to be adopted and applied, and to provide all further information on any developments which may occur in the matter.
.The Committee has moreover stressed its concern, especially in view of the situation described above, regarding the detention of many trade unionists (whose names, and often also trade union functions, had been indicated in the complaints). On several occasions, and particularly in may , the Committee has given, in an annex to its report, the information supplied by the Government on the trade unionists concerned. At its May-June  session the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee:
.In its letter of  May  the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) points out, in the first place, that the number of joint commissions actually functioning is far below that indicated by the Government in May  and that, at present, the authorities even try to hinder their setting up. The complainant mentions two specific instances (the ""Aurora"" textile factory and the ""Banco Comercial"") and adds that in certain",-1,1973,Uruguay
140,"cases workers who request the setting up of such commissions are being subjected to pressure and persecution.
.The WFTU further states that trade union premises, which are the property of the workers' organisations, have been closed, thus depriving the trade unions, and their leaders as a whole, of their means of action, and that government bodies have occupied the premises in question. The WFTU mentions the case of the Unified National Trade Union of Construction Workers and Allied Trades (SUNCA), whose premises have apparently become the barracks of the Grenadier Guards, the case of the National Union of Metalworkers and Allied Trades (UNTMRA), whose premises have apparently become the headquarters of Police Section , of the National Workers' Convention (CNT), whose premises have apparently become a centre for the women police of Montevideo (and whose equipment is being used by department No.  of the police), the case of the Metalworkers' Federation, the use of whose premises has been requested by the Police Commissioner of section No. , the case of the Federation of Primary School Teachers' Unions and that of the Secondary School Teachers' Trade Union, whose premises have also apparently become para-military installations.
.The WFTU emphasises that all trade union activities have been suppressed six years ago, that the experience with joint commissions has been negative and that the Government alleges that the steps to be taken in trade union matters must be tied to the process of ""national reconstruction"". The WFTU draws particular attention to the numerous dismissals continuously taking place on the basis of institutional Act No.  ( members of the staff of the Clnicas Hospital were thus dismissed in January ). The WFTU concludes that these dilatory tactics, obviously in expectation of the complete suppression of all attempts at free trade union activity, show the illusory character of the promise of trade union freedom.
.The WFTU also points out that the state of health of Rosario Pietraroia and of Gerardo Cuesta is precarious. It reiterates that, contrary to the Government's statements, Oscar Tassino Atz (trade union organiser of the AUTE) has disappeared after his arrest on  July , and quotes statements by eyewitnesses in support. The complainant adds that Alicia Surez is being illegally held in prison after having served her sentence and that new waves of arrests, followed by torture, have occurred in February and March ; the prisoners include, in particular, Hctor Giacobone (secretary to the Meatworkers' Federation), of the meat-packing sector, and Csar Gmez, of the banking sector. In conclusion, the WFTU reiterates its request for the establishment of a commission of inquiry.
.The National Workers' Convention (CNT) asserts, in its letter of  September , that the police headquarters of Montevideo has notified the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) on  July  that its legal personality was ""without effect"", in accordance with Decree No.   dated  August . The complainant attaches a photocopy of this notification and adds that the deduction from wages of the trade union dues of AEBU members has been discontinued. The complainant also quotes a decision of the Ministry of the Interior (dated  July ) ordering the President of AEBU to hand over within  days to the National Office of information and Research a list of members of a new governing board consisting of persons having no ""adverse past records"", so that the authorities may, upon request, later allow artistic and cultural events to take place under the supervision of the above-mentioned National Office.
.The National Workers' Convention further alleges that pressure is being exerted on the workers, even those who are under arrest, to make them join together in a nationalist trade union. The authorities have allegedly filmed the delegates at a meeting in the ""Sadil"" textile factory because the latter refused to allow the military to participate in the meeting. The CNT also expresses its concern regarding living conditions in the prisons where- the trade union leaders are detained (under-nourishment, absence of adequate medical care and sanitation, total lack of medicaments, ill-treatment and repression). The CNT mentions in particular the case of Rosario Pietraroia who has lost an eye for lack of proper medical care.
.The Government states, in its letter dated  September , that the period has now concluded during which the authorities received suggestions from the worker and employer organisations on the preliminary draft of the bill on professional associations. The comments made by the organisations consulted have been transmitted to the group of experts which had drawn up the preliminary draft. The latter is now analysing the observations submitted, as well as the comments by the ILO supervisory organs. The Government also states that once the study and adoption of the preliminary draft is completed, these experts will submit their final report to the executive branch of the Government. The Government will then take a decision on the matter; it has the intention of submitting the final draft law to the Council of State by  December .
.Moreover, the Government indicates that in its communication of  November that the executive intends to suggest to the legislative authorities a rapid examination of the Bill mentioned above which could be done in the legislative paper accompanying it. In addition, the Government supplies information on the persons listed in the annexes to the th Report; it appears from this, in particular, that Manuel Pieiro Pena and Alicia Dinorah Surez Turcati have been released. It also states that Hector Agustin Giacobone Marrero and Csar Clelio Gmez Mello have been brought before the military courts.
.The Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government on the state of the preliminary work on the Act concerning professional associations. It notes, in particular, that the comments made by the ILO supervisory organs are now being examined, that the final draft of the Act is due to be submitted to the Council of State by  December  and that the Government will suggest that it should examine it rapidly. The Committee wishes to reiterate that, after six years of serious restrictions upon trade union activities, there is a very urgent need to promulgate and implement a legislation which recognises the right for all workers, without any distinction whatsoever, to set up occupational organisations and the right of these organisations to function and operate freely, in accordance with the various Conventions on freedom of association.
.In addition, the Government has sent, at the commencement of the Committee's session, certain information on the situation of the trade unionists listed in the annexes to the th Report. The Committee intends to examine this information at its next session. Nevertheless, it notes now that Manuel Pieiro Pena (see paragraph ) and Alicia Dinorah Surez Turcati (see paragraph ) have been released. It also notes that Hctor Agustin Giacobone Marrero and Csar Clelio Grimez Mello (see paragraph ) have been brought before the military courts.
.The complainants have, however, submitted new complaints, some of them recently, to which the Government has not yet replied. These complaints deal more particularly with the following points: (a) the dilatory attitude of the authorities regarding a return to freedom of association (including various forms of pressure exerted on the workers, the negative experience of joint commissions and new dismissals based on Institutional Act No. ); (b) the continued occupation of trade union premises; (c) measures taken against the AEBU; and (d) conditions of detention and situation of various arrested trade unionists.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that it proposes to submit the draft Act on occupational associations to the Council of State by  December , and to suggest a rapid examination of it;(b) to express the firm hope that this draft, in its final version, will be in full conformity with ILO Conventions Nos.  and  which have been ratified by Uruguay, to urge the Government to adopt it in the very near future and to ask the Government to give the date on which it is envisaged that it will be promulgated;(c) to ask the Government to send the draft Act which will be submitted to the Council of State and to supply information on any developments which may take place;(d) to urge the Government to transmit its observations and additional information on the new allegations of the complainants, summarised in paragraph  above;(e) to ask the Government to send the information requested in subparagraphs (b) and (d) above by  January  at the latest;(f) to note that the Committee will carry out a new examination of this case as a whole at its neat session and take note, in the meantime, of the present interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.Since  the Committee has had before it complaints relating in part to the general trade union situation in the country. A few months after the dissolution by the Government of a trade union Confederation, the National Workers' Convention (CNT), a Decree (No. ",-1,1973,Uruguay
141,"of  August ) was promulgated for the purpose of regulating trade union activities, but had been only partially applied. Although many of the unions had complied with the necessary formalities before the decision to suspend the application of Decree No. , which was taken shortly after its adoption, they had been unable to have themselves placed on the national register of trade unions. Despite the suspension of the Decree, the provisions relating to the prohibition of strikes and political activities by the trade unions had been applied. After his second direct contacts mission to Uruguay (April ), the representative of the Director-General pointed out that from the legal point of view, it might be said that, except for the promulgation of the Decree respecting the setting up of joint Committees in undertakings, dated  February , the situation had remained unchanged and the trade unions had a de facto but not a de jure existence.
.Nevertheless, as the Committee noted in May , the factual situation had changed: there had been an improvement in that of the trade unions affiliated to the General Confederation of Workers of Uruguay (CGTU), which had been able to perform certain internal activities (meetings, elections, etc.). On the other hand, the unions affiliated to the National Workers' Convention (CNT), which was dissolved by the Government after the change of regime in , appeared to have remained to a large extent inactive: many of their leaders were detained, had left the country or had been dismissed; the premises of a number of these unions were being watched by the police, had been closed, or were under surveillance, etc. As for industrial relations activities, the extent of recognition of the unions of the CGTU and their leaders depended on whether they were on good terms with the employers or the heads of public administrative services. As to the unions affiliated to the CNT, these did not appear to be recognised either in the private or in the public sector.
.The Government also referred on more than one occasion to the subversive activities with which it had had to deal and which had constituted the reasons for the exceptional measures taken in the trade union and other fields. In this respect the Committee emphasised that there should be no confusion between trade unions' performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers, and the possible ---------- pursuit by certain of their members of other activities having nothing to do with trade union functions. The penal responsibilities which such persons might incur by such acts should in no way result in measures amounting to depriving the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action.
.The Government also declared that the normalisation of the trade union situation had to be analysed within the broader framework of the political and institutional normalisation of the country. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that, although respect for freedom of association is closely bound up with respect for civil liberties in general, as was stated by the International Labour Conference in  in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, it was nevertheless important, with this reservation, to distinguish between the recognition of freedom of association and questions relating to a country's political evolution; trade union legislation and the reform of a country's political institutions were two separate matters. The Committee had on different occasions drawn the attention of the Government to the need to adopt and apply legislation in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.In February  the Committee examined the text of a draft Bill on occupational associations which had been communicated to it by the Government it remarked that this text had certain positive features but felt obliged to make observations regarding a number of other provisions which did not appear to be in conformity with certain principles of freedom of association. In bringing these observations to the notice of the Government, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, stressed the urgency of Uruguay's adopting and applying legislation based on the principles of freedom of association and requested the Government to bring the draft text fully into line with the freedom of association Conventions ratified by Uruguay. It also requested the Government to supply information on any developments in this area.
.The Committee was also called upon to examine the cases of numerous detained trade unionists whose names, and in many cases their trade union functions, had been mentioned in the complaints. The Committee noted the information supplied by the Government according to which certain of these persons had never been arrested or had been released. During the direct contacts the Government supplied information giving the impression that the criminal proceedings set in motion were aimed first of all at activities of a political character considered by the Government to endanger security and public order. However, the representative of the Director-General found that some of the charges were accompanied by other accusations linked to the activities of the CNT, which was dissolved by the Government in  in a smaller number of cases the Committee noted that the persons concerned had been arrested for reasons which could be considered as being linked solely with their trade union activities, in its subsequent written communications the Government confined itself to quoting sections of the ordinary or military penal codes under which trade unionists had been prosecuted or sentenced, but did not supply details of the specific offences with which they had been charged in each case; nor had it communicated the texts of the judgements rendered in each case, as requested by the Governing Body. In the absence of more detailed information, the Committee noted that it had no facts at its disposal enabling it to ascertain whether the trade unionists were sentenced purely for reasons unconnected with their trade union office or activities.
.The Committee also regretted that the Government had not supplied detailed observations on the allegations relating to the ill-treatment allegedly suffered by certain prisoners and to the precariousness of the right to defence. As regards the latter point, the complainants had stated that, at first, civilian lawyers had been, able to carry out their functions and defend prisoners. This situation had deteriorated progressively and they had been confronted with obstacles in the exercise of their profession, especially as regards being able to communicate with their clients. Subsequently, stated the complainants, lawyers had been arrested and accused, for example, of complicity with the prisoners; others had been threatened and had left the country. Those who had been released could no longer exercise their professional activities. As for the detained workers, they were informed, often after lengthy imprisonment, that they must choose a lawyer in  hours. Having no contact with the outside, they were obliged to accept a lawyer appointed on their behalf so that the trial was not delayed further. Other allegations referred to ill-treatment allegedly suffered by imprisoned trade unionists (case of Mr. Iguini).
.At its February-March  session the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, repeated its request to the Government for information on the specific acts for which trade unionists had been prosecuted or sentenced (including copies of the judgements) and or the allegations concerning ill-treatment of prisoners and obstruction of their right to defence. It urged the Government to supply the information requested on the trade unionists listed in the annex to the st Report of the Committee.
.In its letter of  February  the Trade Unions International of Workers in the Metal Industry refers to the case of Rosario Pietraroia, General Secretary of the National Union of workers in the metal and Allied Trades (UNTMRA), who was arrested in  and sentenced to  years' imprisonment in October . The complainant goes on to say that his health has deteriorated as a result of torture, and he has even lost an eye; the authorities want him to be operated on in prison, although there is no guarantee of success, since the premises are not properly equipped. The complainant organisation states that it has fears for the prisoner's life.
.In addition, WFTU alleges, in its letter of  March , that Carlos Gmez, a former official of the Uruguayan Bank Employees' Association, has been imprisoned; the prisoner, who is now retired, was for several years a senior official in this trade union. WFTU also refers to the sentence of four years' imprisonment passed on Rubn Acasuso, former General Secretary of the Uruguayan Press Association. Finally, the complainant states that the whereabouts of Eduardo Arign, a commerce worker who has been imprisoned since  June , are unknown.
.In its letter of  April , the Government supplies information on many of the trade unionists cited by the complainants; the situation of some of them remains unchanged with respect to the information previously supplied; details in this regard are given in the annexes to the present report. In particular, the Government mentions that",0,1973,Uruguay
142,"about ten persons have been released, one conditionally. Rosario Pietraroia was arrested on  January  and his trial by the military courts began on  August ; he was sentenced by the court of first instance to  years' imprisonment (minus preventive detention) and appealed against this decision to the Supreme Military Tribunal. According to the Government, there is no evidence of a deterioration in his health.
.In February , the Committee noted that the Government had confined itself to quoting sections of the ordinary or military penal codes under which trade unionists had been prosecuted or sentenced, without supplying details of the specific offences with which they had been charged in each case. In this connection, the Government stresses that the trade unionists whose names are cited by the complainants were arrested, prosecuted or sentenced not because of their presumed trade union membership or activities but as citizens or residents of the country subject to its laws. In all cases, adds the Government, the action was taken solely on the grounds of the criminal behaviour of the accused and in no case by reason of their actual or presumed trade union activities. Furthermore, the status of trade unionist is not acquired by the mere fact of exercising an activity, occupation or trade, as is the case, according to the Government, of the persons concerned in most of the complaints presented; a trade union member or official is one who militates actively within a trade union or who holds office therein. A person who militates actively in the field of politics properly speaking, using his position as a trade unionist in order to further a given political ideology or even, in many cases, as a cover for subversive activity, can obviously not be considered as a trade unionist, even if he attempts to dissimulate his true activities by this means. The Government goes on to state that it has furnished the information requested as far as it is in its power to do so and that it has already explained why it has not given details of the specific offences or other information requested; these, states the Government, lie solely within the competence of the judicial administration, the accused and their counsel, and it is accordingly not for the Government to supply them. The Government stresses that the application of the law on the national territory is secured by the legally constituted judicial authorities, and it is for them to decide whether an activity is criminal or otherwise. The Government and the judicial authorities respect the law, and it is for the latter to pass judgement in conformity with the national legislation in force, including duly ratified Conventions.
.As regards the allegations concerning the precariousness of the right to defence and the ill-treatment alleged to have been inflicted on certain of the prisoners, the Government considers that it is for the complainants to prove these accusations and that the burden of proof cannot be laid on the Government, since the alleged facts are non-existent. If the complainants claim that there has been a failure to observe the law in specific circumstances, they must furnish detailed evidence in support of their allegations to enable the latter to be examined and refuted, as will undoubtedly be the case in all instances. Finally, the Government requests that complaints should be framed in a more serious spirit, with at least a minimum of detail, and that they should no longer contain lists of persons whose surnames and given names are incomplete or inaccurate, who are stated to have engaged in imaginary trade union activities or who, according to frivolous, malicious and entirely unfounded allegations, are said to have been denied guarantees for their defence, to have suffered ill-treatment, etc.
.In addition, the Government expresses its gratitude for the Committee's valuable comments on the draft Bill on occupational associations. It states its conviction that these comments will permit improvements in the concepts set forth in the text which is to be submitted to the Council of State. The Government states in its letter of  May  that; following upon its consultations, it sent on  May  a copy of this draft Bill to the most representative workers' and employers' organisations and invited them to make such comments and suggestions as they thought appropriate. Moreover, it adds, this document received the greatest publicity through the different media so as to make it known to public opinion in general.
.Finally, the Government supplies statistics on joint Committees in undertakings:  are operational,  are shortly to be set up and  are in process of formation. The sectors of activity covered are the following: the textile industry, electronics, private banking, social bodies, cement products, construction, the chemical, glass, sugar, tobacco and dairy products industries, engineering, metallurgy, horse-racing, the drinks industry and broadcasting.
.The Committee notes the observations and information communicated by the Government. In this connection it must stress, firstly, the abnormal situation of the entire Uruguayan trade union movement since the change of regime in June . As recalled in paragraphs  and  above, the trade unions are unable to carry out their specific activities, since their recognition by the authorities and by the employers depends upon a status governed by legislation which has not yet been promulgated. In these circumstances trade union activities in conformity with the international standards in this field may in practice be considered as illegal or not safeguarded by law, contrary to the international obligations assumed by Uruguay when it ratified the-freedom of association Conventions.
.The obstacles to the exercise of trade union rights resulting from this situation are set forth in paragraph  above. In addition, a number of joint Committees ( of which are operational) have been set up in undertakings under a Decree of  February . The Committee has noted this latest development but has stressed that such bodies may not serve as substitutes for trade union organisations. In this connection it feels obliged to recall that the National Constitution guarantees the right of association (section ) as well as the right of workers to form trade unions and the right to strike (section ), and that Uruguay has also ratified Conventions Nos.  and , which lay down basic rights in the field of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, after six years of substantial restrictions on the principal trade union activities, it has now become extremely urgent to adopt an Act respecting occupational associations in conformity with international standards on freedom of association. Likewise, in the situation mentioned above, the question of the arrest and treatment of trade unionists is also of undoubted importance.
.In connection with the latter point, while noting the information supplied by the Government in its most recent communication regarding the release of ten persons, the Committee notes that even recently the complainant organisations were still drawing attention to the harsh sentences served on trade unionists, such as Rosario Pietraroia, General Secretary of the National Union of Workers in the Metal and Allied Trades (UNTMRA), or Rubn Acasuso, former General Secretary of the Uruguayan Press Association. The Governing Body requested the Government to communicate a copy of the judgements rendered in the case of the sentenced trade unionists to enable the Committee to satisfy itself that the persons concerned had not been punished for facts connected with their trade union functions or activities. The Government has not supplied any text of such decisions, but has repeated that these sentences were passed for reasons unrelated to trade union activities.
.In its most recent communication the Government states that it has not been established that certain of the persons mentioned by the complainants were trade unionists and that others merely used their trade union office as a cover for other activities. Nevertheless, the Government does not dispute the fact that other persons who have been prosecuted or sentenced were trade union officials, and the Committee considers that it would have been useful for it to have at its disposal more complete information on the reasons adduced for the prosecution of these persons or the sentences passed on them which have been mentioned by the Government, in particular for the purpose of deciding whether account was taken of their former trade union activities in the application of the sections of the penal legislation quoted by the Government.
.The Committee wishes to recall that in many earlier instances in which cases were pending before a court and the Committee considered that the judgements would provide it with information enabling it to reach conclusions with full knowledge of the facts, it has followed the practice of requesting the Government concerned to communicate the text of the decisions rendered, with the reasons adduced therefor. Governments have generally co operated by sending the texts of the judgements requested. During the last direct contacts mission to the country the Uruguayan Government itself supplied detailed information on the specific offences with which a number of the imprisoned trade unionists were charged, including the grounds for the",-1,1973,Uruguay
143,"accusation in a number of the judgements rendered. The public nature of judicial decisions is, moreover, a generally recognised principle (see, for example, section () of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights).
.The Committee also notes that the Government confines itself to rejecting the allegations regarding the obstruction of the right to defence. These allegations, which are referred to in paragraph  and which relate to a general situation, were formulated by the complainants in their oral statements to the Committee in May .
.The Committee also notes that Manuel Pieiro Pena, an official of UNTMRA, appears to have remained under arrest after serving his sentence, to judge from the most recent information furnished by the Government to the effect that his release is under consideration. In this respect the Committee wishes to point out, as it has done in an earlier case, that the detention of trade unionists, if it followed an acquittal by the competent courts, or after they had served their sentences, would constitute a violation of freedom of association.
.As regards the trade union situation in general, the Committee notes the latest information communicated by the Government regarding the draft Bill on occupational associations. The Government points out, in particular, that it is in the process of consultations over this draft Bill with the workers' and employers' organisations and that the text of the Bill will be submitted to the Council of State. In February  the Committee considered that it was urgent for trade unions to be allowed to carry on their activities without hindrance, in law as well as in fact, since this was a necessary precondition for the establishment of a harmonious system of industrial relations; the adoption of an Act on occupational associations should be a decisive step in this direction. It had examined in detail the provisions of the draft Bill, which, it emphasised, had certain positive features, such as the right to form occupational associations without previous authorisation and to set up second- and third-degree organisations. Nevertheless, the Committee added, a number of other provisions did not appear to be fully compatible with certain principles of freedom of association, and it made observations with a view to the re-examination of these provisions in order to ensure that the legislation which was to be adopted was in conformity with these principles and with the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay.
.These observations related firstly to the conditions to be fulfilled by trade union officials, in particular the obligation to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" and to have belonged to the branch of activity represented by the union for at least two years. The Committee was also of the opinion that workers should be able to decide whether they preferred to establish, at the primary level, a works union or another form of basic organisation, such as an industrial or craft union. The Committee also expressed its views on the provisions under which the aims of organisations must be exclusively occupational and have no reference to politics and that organisations and their members must respect the law of the land. In this respect, the Committee pointed out, the national provisions on the settlement of collective labour disputes and strikes, on the right of assembly or freedom of expression for organised workers, must be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee noted that several sections of the draft Bill regulated in considerable detail various aspects of the internal administration of trade unions, and in this connection recalled that even if some of these provisions might be designed to secure more efficient operation of trade union organisations, the idea underlying Article  (and Article ) of Convention No.  is that workers and employers should be allowed to decide for themselves what rules should be observed for the administration of their organisations and elections held therein. The Committee added that, if the draft were to be adopted in its present form, magistrates would be under the obligation, in the event of refusal or withdrawal of registration, to apply provisions which are not fully compatible with the provisions of Convention No. .
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the detained trade unionists:(i) to take note of the most recent information transmitted by the Government, in particular the release of ten of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints;(ii) likewise to note that even at a recent date trade unionists such as Rosario Pietraroia and Rubn Acasuso were given harsh prison sentences, and to regret that the Government has not supplied more detailed information - including the judgements rendered - on the facts imputed to the trade unionists who have been prosecuted or sentenced for acts considered by the Government to lie outside the scope of trade union activities;(iii) to request the Government to communicate detailed information on the case of Mr. Manuel Pieiro Pena, an official of UNTMRA, whose release is still under consideration after he has served his sentence;(b) as regards the Bill on occupational associations:(i) to take note of the Government's statement that the observations of the Committee on the draft Bill will be taken into consideration during the finalisation of the text which will be submitted to the Council of State and that the Government is carrying out consultations on this draft Bill with the workers' and employers' organisations;(ii) to stress once again the importance of the early promulgation of the Act, the final text of which should be in full conformity with the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Uruguay;(iii) to request the Government to indicate the date on which it envisages the adoption and application of the final text of the Act, and to supply any further information on developments in this area;(c) to request the Government to send the information requested in clauses (a) and (b) above by  September  at the latest; and(d) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.After the second direct contacts mission in Uruguay in April  the Committee noted that there had been no change in the legal position of trade unions since the first mission in June and July . What had changed was the factual situation: although that of the unions affiliated to the General Confederation of Workers of Uruguay (CGTU) had improved and they were able to perform certain internal activities (meetings, elections, etc.), the affiliates of the National Workers' Convention (CMT), which had been dissolved by the Government after the change of regime in , appeared to have remained to a large extent inactive; many of their leaders were under arrest, had left the country or had been dismissed; the premises of certain of these unions were under police control, closed, under surveillance, etc. As for industrial relations activity, the extent of recognition of the unions of CGTU and their leaders depended on whether they were on good terms with the employers or the heads of their public administrative services. As to the unions affiliated to CMT, these did not appear to be recognised either in the private or in the public sector.
.In the information which it supplied to the Committee for its November  Session, the Government referred, as it had done on earlier occasions, to the subversive activities with which it had had to deal and which had constituted the reasons for the exceptional measures taken. In this connection the Committee emphasised that there should be no confusion between trade unions' performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers, and the possible pursuit by certain of their members of other activities having nothing to do with trade union functions. The penal responsibilities which such persons must incur by such acts should no way result in measures amounting to depriving the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action. The Committee regretted that despite the time which had elapsed the trade union organisations were still encountering serious difficulties; the continuing existence of serious divergences between the Conventions on freedom of association on the one hand and national law and practice on the other was a matter for great concern.
.Shortly before the Committee's November  Session the Government sent the text of a draft Bill on occupational associations prepared by a group of experts. Because this text was received at such a late date the Committee was unable to examine it in substance at that session. It noted with interest, however, that the Bill envisaged the possibility of setting up organisations of first, second and third degree. On the other hand, it stressed that the obligation of trade union leaders to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" could give rise to abuses in the absence of precise criteria on which a decision of the courts could be based in the event of a trade union leader being accused of failing to abide by his declaration. On the recommendation of the",-1,1973,Uruguay
144,"Committee the Governing Body drew the attention of the Government to this latter point in November . The Governing Body expressed its concern at the slowness in adopting legislation based on principles of freedom of association and requested the Government to indicate the date on which it envisaged the adoption and application of the final text of the law.
.The Committee also noted that the number of joint Committees in operation had noticeably increased. It repeated that these bodies should in no case substitute for trade union organisations and that workers' representatives on them should be freely elected without it being possible for them to be prevented from being elected because of their previous trade union activity. These bodies should, as in other countries, have a useful role to play in industrial relations but, in the present trade union situation in the country, should only be seen as a transitional measure until a legal way could be found - and this should be in the near future - for workers to be represented by trade unions. With this proviso, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to continue to provide information on developments in the situation concerning these Committees.
.The Committee was also called upon to examine the cases of numerous detained trade unionists. Although the number of prisoners who had been judged by the courts was increasing, it noted, many trade unionists were still awaiting trial; some of them had been doing so for long periods. The Committee accordingly once again expressed its concern at the slowness of the judicial procedure. Furthermore, it noted that Mr. Hctor Enrique Altesor Hafliger appeared to be still in prison after the decision to abandon legal proceedings against him. The Government also stated that a certain number of the persons mentioned had been released, but did not supply details of the specific offences for which they had been prosecuted or sentenced (in particular copy of the judgements rendered). On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body regretted this absence of additional information.
.The complainants had also made allegations regarding conditions of imprisonment and the right to defence. In connection with the latter point, they stated that, at first, civilian lawyers had been able to carry out their functions and defend prisoners. This situation had deteriorated progressively and they had been confronted with obstacles in the exercise of their profession, especially as regards being able to communicate with their clients. Subsequently, stated the complainants, lawyers had been arrested and accused, for example, of complicity with the prisoners; others had been threatened and had left the country. Those who were released could no longer exercise their professional activities. As for the detained workers, they were informed, often after lengthy imprisonment, that they must choose a lawyer in  hours. Having no contact with the outside they were obliged to accept a lawyer appointed on their behalf so that the trial was not delayed further. In this connection, one of the representatives of the complainant organisations at the Committee's sittings of  and  May , who was arrested in  and again in , described his personal case and the torture to which he had been subjected. He added that all prisoners were tortured. Other allegations referred to cases of ill treatment suffered even recently by imprisoned trade unionists (Mr. Iguini).
.The Government had not replied to the allegations concerning ill-treatment inflicted on prisoners and the precarious nature of the right to defence. The Committee considered that detailed replies on this vitally important aspect of the case would enable it to ascertain whether the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants were enjoying full guarantees as regards the conditions of their imprisonment and the right to defence. The Governing Body also regretted the absence of observations from the Government on these aspects of the case. Moreover, according to certain allegations, Mr. Hugo Pereyra, a builders' trade union leader, had died as a result of ill-treatment. The Committee also requested the Government to state whether any investigation had been made into the circumstances of his death and to communicate the results of such investigations.
.On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body requested the Government to transmit information and observations on the various aspects of the case. In particular, it requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the situation of the trade unionists listed in the Annex to the th Report in respect of whom it had not yet supplied details, and on the investigations made in the case of Mr. Hugo Pereyra (paragraph ) and on the present situation of Mr. Altesor Hafliger (paragraph ).
.The Trade Unions International of Transport, Ports and Fishery Workers protests in general terms against trade union persecution in the country in its telegram of  October . In a letter of  December  the World Federation of Trade Unions, on the basis of statements by the relatives of the person concerned, alleges that Oscar Tassino Atzu was arrested on  July  at a certain address in Montevideo by a member of the joint armed forces and that he has since then disappeared; it has not been possible to discover his whereabouts despite repeated approaches by his relatives to the military authorities and the police. This information, adds the WFTU, contradicts that given by the Government to the Committee for its November  Session (according to this information Mr. Tassino Atzu had been arrested on to February  but had been released the same day). The WFTU states that it has fears for the life of Mr. Tassino Atzu. The Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees, for its part, alleges, in a communication received on  January , that the trade union leader Adolfo Drescher was transferred from his place of imprisonment two weeks earlier and that he has since then disappeared; in this case, too, the complainant organisation says that it has fears for Mr. Drescher's life.
.In its letter of  January  the Government stresses, in connection with the legislation on occupational associations which it has announced, that its main objective is national reconstruction, which needs to be carried out at a reasonable pace. This process, it adds, includes the adoption of trade union legislation to guarantee workers' rights and to protect them in the defence of their interests. It is taking place more rapidly than foreseen. The Government stresses that its attitude is one of permanent co-operation with the ILO, to which it has furnished an unlimited supply of information on the process on which it has embarked. As regards the date envisaged for the adoption and application of the final text of the law, the Government considers that it is hazardous to name definite dates: consultations must be held on the draft Bill and comments supplied as regards its content; the next stage, which will follow immediately, will be the preparation of the Bill to be sent to the Council of State for this legislative organ to discuss, analyse and finally approve the law. The Government nevertheless states that it is determined to pass legislation in the near future.
.As regards the obligation placed by the draft Bill on trade unionists to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" the Government remarks that this arises out of section  of the Constitution of the Republic, under which the nation has adopted a democratic republican form of government; respect for this provision is a basic and imperative requirement for citizens. The obligation laid on trade union leaders is not discriminatory either in form or in substance; it cannot give rise to abuses since the criterion to be applied is expressly stated in the Constitution. The purpose of this provision is to prevent trade union officials from using their position to make attacks by unlawful means on the democratic republican order enshrined in the Constitution. Moreover, this obligation has existed for many years under Acts Nos. , of  February  and , of  August  (respecting the status of public officials), as well as under Act No. , of  March , which are all quoted in the draft Bill.
.The Government next supplies the following statistics on the joint Committees:  are in operation in the textile industries, electricity, the chemical industries, and the sugar and tobacco industries;  others are in the course of Constitution and will shortly be established in the private banking sector, the glass industry, the dairy products industry, the metallurgical industry, the textile industry, the race tracks, cloth manufacturing, and the manufacture of containers.
.The Governing Body regretted the absence of additional information on the precise allegations made against the trade unionists who had been prosecuted or sentenced (including copies of the judgements) and the absence of observations on the allegations concerning ill-treatment of prisoners and obstruction of their right of defence. In this connection the Government states that it has answered all the requests addressed to it and has supplied a vast volume of facts and all the",-1,1973,Uruguay
145,"additional information asked for. What is more, it has done this although the requests in a large number of cases referred to persons who were not trade union leaders but who were merely involved in offences under the ordinary or military penal codes. The judgements, continues the Government, are a matter for the competent judicial bodies and the persons concerned. The sections of the penal code quoted are self-explanatory and show that the parsons concerned were prosecuted for offences and not because they were trade union officials. According to the Government the information provided so far is clear evidence that all the prisoners have now been brought before the competent judicial authorities and that their right of defence has not been obstructed. The Government rejects the complaints concerning ill-treatment of prisoners, which are, it says, couched in general and imprecise terms and are unaccompanied by the merest shred of evidence; the Government considers that it is its duty to defend itself against mere presumptions put forward in a spirit of utter irresponsibility.
.In addition, the Government supplies information on all the trade unionists listed in the Annex to the th Report, apart from the persons who have been unconditionally released (including Oscar Tassino Atzu, who is again mentioned by the complainants as having been arrested): the situation of most of these trade unionists remains unchanged; information supplied on the others is contained in the Annex to the present report. In particular, the Government mentions that Hctor Enrique Altesor Hafliger left the country on  March  after a court decision to abandon his case on  June . The Government also recalls that it has already supplied a report on the autopsy carried out on Hugo Pereira Cunha who, according to some allegations, was said to have died as a result of ill-treatment; according to this report, death had been caused by a blood clot followed by a haemorrhage; the Government communicates the text of the court decision to close the proceedings relating to Mr. Pereira's death. In the preamble to this decision it is stated that Mr. Pereira died at the central hospital of the armed forces, but that the investigation, which was conducted in accordance with military court procedure, was dropped in the absence of any proof that a crime had been committed. In a communication of  February , the Government states that Adolfo Drescher had, on  November , been brought before the military court on the basis of the following crimes: subversive association (section V of the Military Penal Code), theft (section  of the ordinary Penal Code), forgery and alteration of official documents by a private individual (section  of the same Code).
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Government has already declared on an earlier occasion that the normalisation of the trade union situation has to be analysed within the broader framework of the political and institutional normalisation of the country. In this connection the Committee emphasised that, although respect for freedom of association is closely bound up with respect for civil liberties in general, as was stated by the International Labour Conference in  in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, it was nevertheless important, with this reservation, to distinguish between the recognition of freedom of association and questions relating to a country's political evolution. The Committee remains convinced that trade union legislation and the reform of a country's political institutions are two separate matters, and that it is urgent for trade unions to be allowed to carry on their activities without hindrance, in law as well as in fact, since this is a necessary precondition for the establishment of a harmonious system of industrial relations. The adoption of a law on occupational associations should be a decisive step in this direction. The Committee trusts that this law will enter into force in the very near future.
.The Committee has examined the provisions of the draft Bill on occupational associations, a copy of which was communicated to it by the Government shortly before the November  Session. This text, as the Committee has already had occasion to remark, has certain positive features, such as the right to form occupational associations without previous authorisation and to set up second and third-degree organisations. Nevertheless, as regards a number of other provisions which do not appear to be fully compatible with certain principles of freedom of association, the Committee feels obliged to make observations with a view to the re-examination of the provisions in order to ensure that the legislation which is shortly to be adopted is in conformity with these principles and with the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay.
.The Committee has already remarked that the obligation laid on trade union leaders to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" may give rise to abuses. The draft Bill does not state what specific acts are deemed to constitute breaches of faith in democracy, and thus renders legal supervision of the application of this provision impossible. The other conditions of eligibility for trade union office - which differ from those required of leaders of employers' associations - also impose restrictions on the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom. In particular, under sections  and  of the draft Bill read in conjunction, trade union officials must have belonged to the branch of activity represented by the union for at least two years. The Committee has already pointed out in other cases that, if such a requirement applied to all office-holders in trade union organisations, it would be incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the establishment of trade union organisations, the Committee is of the opinion that workers should be able to decide whether they prefer to establish, at the primary level, a works union - the only possibility allowed under section  of the draft Bill, apart from certain exceptions - or another form of basic organisation, such as an industrial or craft union.
.The aims of the organisation must, according to section  of the draft Bill, be exclusively occupational and have no reference to politics. In this connection, the Committee has already expressed the view, in an earlier case concerning Uruguay, that a general prohibition of political activities of any kind would not seem to be compatible with the principles and guarantees of Convention No. , and it would also seem to be unrealistic as regards its application in actual practice. For instance, trade unions may wish to make publicly known their position on matters of economic and social policy which affect their members. The Committee added that States should be able, without prohibiting in general terms political activities by occupational organisations, to entrust to the judicial authorities the task of repressing abuses which might, in certain cases, be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be the economic and social advancement of their members. Furthermore, a number of sections of the draft Bill prescribe that organisations and their members must respect the law of the land (sections ,  and ). In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , which states that in exercising the rights provided for in the Convention workers and their organisations, like other persons or organised collectivities, shall respect the law of the land, which shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in Convention No. . The Committee accordingly wishes to point out that the national provisions on the settlement of collective labour disputes and strikes, on the right of assembly or freedom of expression for organised workers, must be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.The draft Bill also regulates in considerable detail various aspects of the internal administration of trade unions; occupational associations may at any time be called upon to supply reports on their activities to the authorities (section ); trade union assemblies may not last more than four hours and must have a quorum of at least  per cent of the members (section ). It is compulsory to vote at trade union elections (section ); a plebiscite is required for the examination of draft collective agreements (section ); members who abstain from voting during elections or plebiscites are suspended for one year (section ); when trade union organisations act in a representative capacity, the votes taken must be public (section ); at the time of elections and plebiscites various formalities must be complied with at the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (registry of lists and notifications the nature of which is not specified in the draft Bill; section ); lower-level trade unions are responsible for decisions taken by higher-level organisations, unless their representatives on the executive have voted against the decision engaging their responsibility or if they are disavowed by the organisation in such a manner that the",-1,1973,Uruguay
146,"decision may be reconsidered (section ).
.Even if some of these provisions may be designed to secure more efficient operation of trade union organisations, the Committee wishes to recall that Articles  and  of Convention No.  protect the autonomy of these organisations; in particular, they guarantee the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. The Convention adds that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. In the above-mentioned case concerning Uruguay, the Committee considered that legislation which minutely regulates the internal election procedures of a trade union is incompatible with the rights afforded to trade anions by the Convention it also considered that legislation imposing penalties on workers who do not participate in elections is not in harmony with the provisions of the Convention. Generally speaking, as indicated, the principles established in Article  of the Convention do not prevent the control of the internal acts of a trade union if those internal acts violate legal provisions or union rules. Nevertheless, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, this control should be exercised by the competent judicial authorities. The Committee is of the opinion that these considerations are also valid in the present case as regards the various provisions mentioned in the previous paragraph. The idea underlying Article  of Convention No.  is that workers and employers should be allowed to decide for themselves what rules should be observed for the administration of their organisations and elections held therein.
.The various obligations mentioned in the foregoing paragraph constitute conditions for the registration of a trade union - which is compulsory (section ) and necessary for the granting of legal personality (section ) - and failure to comply with them can result in deregistration. The labour authorities are competent to permit or refuse registration (section ), but in accordance with Constitutional principles (sections  ff of the Constitution) a petition against an administrative decision may be filed with a court of law. Furthermore, under sections  and  of the draft Bill, the courts are competent to decide on the suspension of the association and the cancellation of registration. Nevertheless, if the draft were to be adopted in its present form, magistrates would be under the obligation, in the event of refusal or withdrawal of registration, to apply provisions which are not, as already mentioned, fully compatible with the provisions of Convention No. .
.Moreover, the number of joint Committees in operation in undertakings has not increased beyond the figures given in November , although the Government stated in May  that a figure of  Committees would be reached after a period of  to  months.
.The Committee notes the information supplied on the numerous trade unionists who are under arrest, in which the Government reports six further cases of conditional or unconditional release. As regards the persons who are still under arrest the Government confines itself to quoting sections of the ordinary or military penal codes under which trade unionists have been prosecuted or sentenced by military courts, that is to say it indicates the kinds of acts which they have committed or allegedly committed, but it does not supply details of the specific offences with which they are charged in each case; nor has it communicated the texts of the judgements rendered in each case, as requested by the Governing Body. At an earlier stage of examination of this case, the Government supplied information of this kind during a direct contacts mission; the information gathered gave the impression that the criminal proceedings set in motion were aimed first of all at activities of a political character considered by the Government to endanger security and public order. However, the representative of the Director-General found that some of the charges were accompanied by other accusations linked to the activities of the CNT, which was dissolved by the Government in . In a smaller number of cases the Committee noted that the persons concerned had been arrested for reasons which could be considered as being linked solely with their trade union activities.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in connection with the present case, where persons have been sentenced on grounds having no relation to trade union rights the matter falls outside its competence. It has nevertheless emphasised that the question whether such a matter is one relating to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned. If in certain cases the Committee has reached the conclusion that allegations relating to measures taken against trade unionists did not call for further examination, this was only after it had received information from the Government showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. In such cases, the Committee, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, has considered that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned. In the present case, and in the absence of more detailed information, the Committee has no facts at its disposal enabling it to ascertain whether the trade unionists were sentenced purely for reasons unconnected with their trade union office or activities.
.The Committee also regrets that the Government has not supplied detailed observations on the allegations relating to the precariousness of the right to defence and the ill-treatment allegedly suffered by certain prisoners whom the complainants mention by name. The Committee notes, however, that the investigation into the death of Hugo Pereira Cunha has been dropped for lack of any evidence that the crime was committed by the military. Furthermore, the complainants state that Oscar Tassino Atzu (a UTE trade union official) has not been released, as stated by the Government in information communicated to the Committee, but that he was arrested on  July .
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the draft Bill on occupational associations;
.After the second direct contacts mission in Uruguay in April  the Committee noted that there had been no change in the legal-position of trade unions since the first mission in June and July . What had changed was the factual situation: although that of the unions affiliated to the General Confederation of Workers of Uruguay (CGTU) had improved and they were able to perform certain internal activities (meetings, elections, etc.), the affiliates of the National Workers' Convention (CNT), which had been dissolved by the Government after the change of regime in , appeared to have remained to a large extent inactive: many of their leaders were under arrest, had left the country or had been dismissed; the premises of certain of these unions were under police control, closed, under surveillance, etc. As for industrial relations activity, the extent of recognition of the unions of CGTU and their leaders depended on whether they were on good terms with the employers or the heads of their public administrative services. As to the unions affiliated to the CNT, these did not appear to be recognised either in the private or in the public sector.
.In the information which it supplied to the Committee for its November  session, the Government referred, as it had done on earlier occasions, to the subversive activities with which it had had to deal and which had constituted the reasons for the exceptional measures taken. Normalisation of occupational organisations, in the Government's opinion, had to be analysed within the broader framework of the political and institutional normalisation of the country. In this respect the Committee emphasised that, although respect for freedom of association was closely bound up with respect for civil liberties in general, it was nevertheless important, with this reservation, to distinguish between the recognition of freedom of association and questions relating to a country's political evolution. Neither should there be confusion between trade unions' performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers, and the possible pursuit by certain of their members of other activities having nothing to do with trade union functions. The penal responsibilities which such persons might incur by such acts should in no way result in measures amounting to depriving the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action. The Committee regretted that despite the time which had elapsed the trade union organisations were still encountering serious difficulties; the continuing existence of serious divergences between the Conventions on freedom of association or the one hand and national law and practice on the other was a matter for great concern.
.The Government subsequently stated -that the working party",0,1973,Uruguay
147,"of experts entrusted with the preparation of a draft Bill concerning trade union organisations had completed the first of the tasks assigned to it by ministerial resolution, namely the preparation of guidelines for the Bill. This preliminary document had been submitted to the executive for study and had been approved by the President of the Republic on  April . The Government communicated a copy of the guidelines for the Bill. The exchange of views between the Committee and the representatives of the complainants and those of the Minister of Labour at its sittings of  and  May  concerned, among other things, this aspect of the case. The Committee considered that the document in question contained positive aspects such as the right of occupational associations to be constituted without prior authorisation. Certain basic ideas contained in the Bill should, however, be made more precise, taking account of the standards contained in the Conventions on freedom of association. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body in June  requested the Government to indicate the date on which it envisaged the adoption and the bringing into force of the final text of the law. It also noted that, according to the representatives of the Government, the draft Bill on trade unions would be completed in the near future and expressed the hope that the Government would be able to communicate a copy thereof in time for the Committee's November  session.
.As regards the present situation, the Committee noted the slowness with which the joint Committees referred to in the Decree of  February  had been set up. Although the Committee considered that these bodies were no substitute for trade union organisations, they could play a useful role in the field of industrial relations. The workers' representatives should therefore not be kept out of the Committees because of their past trade union activities. Furthermore, there should also be such Committees for the public sector. On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body stressed the importance of guaranteeing the free election of workers to these Committees and requested the Government to supply information on the evolution of the situation in this respect.
.The Committee also noted with concern the slowness of the judicial procedure concerning detained trade unionists. Although the fact of exercising a trade union activity or holding trade union office did not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the prolonged detention of trade unionists without being promptly tried could constitute a serious handicap to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee noted, for example, that of the  trade unionists whom the representative of the Director-General had been able to meet or whose files he had been able to examine during his mission to Uruguay in April ,  still awaited trial, in some cases for several years, and only  had been provisionally -released. Nevertheless, certain trade unionists had been brought to trial and sentenced on account of subversive activities. The Committee wished to receive in these cases a copy of the judgements handed down, with the reasons adduced therefor.
.The representatives of the WCL and the WFTU also submitted in May  lists of numerous persons, particularly trade union leaders, stated to have been arrested or to have disappeared. The names of the persons in respect of whom the complainants gave details regarding their trade union membership, activities or functions were communicated to the Government. The representatives of the complainants also made statements regarding conditions of detention and the right of defence. As regards the latter point, they stated that, at first, civil lawyers could carry out their functions and defend prisoners. This situation deteriorated progressively and they were confronted with obstacles in the exercise of their profession, especially as regards being able to communicate with their clients. Subsequently, stated the complainants, lawyers were arrested and accused, for example, of complicit with the prisoners; others had been threatened and had left the country. Those who were released could no longer exercise their professional activities. As for the detained workers, they were informed, often after a lengthy imprisonment, that they must choose a lawyer within  hours. Having no contact with the outside they were obliged to accept a lawyer appointed on their behalf so that the trial was not delayed further. In this connection, a representative of the complainant organisation at the Committee's sittings of  and  May , who was arrested in  and again in , described his personal case and the torture to which he had been subjected. He added that all prisoners were tortured.
.Other allegations referred to cases of ill-treatment suffered even recently by imprisoned trade unionists (Mr. Iguini). The Committee had expressed its strong disapproval of any vexations or brutality inflicted on any prisoners and had pointed out to the Government the importance which it attached to all measures being taken, including the giving of specific instructions and the imposition of exemplary penalties in order to guarantee that no person detained was subject to ill-treatment.
.In these circumstances the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee, once again expressed its concern at the slowness of the judicial procedures in the cases of numerous trade unionists who were still detained and requested the Government to transmit a copy of the judgements, together with the grounds adduced therefor, which had been handed down concerning a number of trade unionists whose names were mentioned. The Governing Body also requested the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations relating to ill-treatment and to obstacles to the rights of defence, and to provide detailed information on the trade unionists whose names and trade union activities had been indicated by the complainants.
.In a communication of  May  the Government announced the release of Mr. Ricardo Vilaro Sanguinetti, an official of the National Workers' Convention (CNT). The Governing Body had already noted this information at its session on  and  June .
.The Government also conveys, in its communication of  October , information on many of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants at the last session of the Committee. The Government requests that the complainant organisations should be asked to furnish more detailed allegations. It considers that unfounded and improbable accusations are often made, as can be seen from the case in point. It stresses that, out of  persons alleged by the complainants to have been arrested, to have disappeared or to have died in prison,  are in prison,  have been released, another (Sal Faccio) to have died of injuries sustained while he was trying to escape by jumping from a moving truck, and  in respect of whom the authorities were in possession of no relevant records or any information or complaints to give grounds for assuming that they had disappeared. In its further communication dated  October  the Government transmits new information about  of the persons whose names had been sent to it. Twelve of those have been freed, in some cases some time ago. The Government also transmits the post mortem report on Hugo Pereyra Cunha who had been charged on account of subversive activities and who died on  March . According to this report, death was caused by a blood clot in the left ventricle followed by a haemorrhage.
.The Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees finally alleges, in a telegram of  October , that Adolfo Drescher, a trade union official in the banking sector, was arrested in early October by the naval forces on account of his trade union activities.
.Shortly before the meeting of the Committee the Government communicated the full text of the draft Bill on trade unions prepared by the working party of experts and information on the situation of the joint Committees. In this connection the Government states that  are functioning and  are being established and will start to function in the near future.
.The Committee has taken note of the draft law on occupational associations. Because this text was communicated at such a late date ( November ) the Committee has not been able to examine it in substance at its present session. The Committee notes with interest, however, that the draft law envisages the possibility of setting up organisations of first, second and third degree although the guidelines examined by the Committee at its last session made no mention of the right to set up federations and Confederations. On the other hand, the Committee notes with regret that the obligation on trade union leaders to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" has been maintained in the draft law. This, the Committee had indicated, could give rise to abuses in the absence of precise criteria on which a decision of the courts could be based in the event of a trade union leader being accused of failing to make the declaration. The Committee intends to make a detailed examination of the draft law at its next session.
.The Committee also notes",0,1973,Uruguay
148,"that the number of joint Committees in operation has noticeably increased since its last session. The Committee would repeat that these bodies should, in no case, substitute for trade union organisations and that workers' representatives on them should be freely elected without it being possible for them to be prevented from being elected because of their previous trade union activity. These bodies should, as in other countries, have a useful role to play in industrial relations but, in the present trade union situation in the country, should only be seen as a transitional measure until a legal way can be found - and this should be in the near future - for workers to be represented by trade unions. With this proviso, the Committee expresses the hope that the joint Committees which are being established will become operational in the very near future and that the Government will continue to provide information on the evolution of the situation as regards these Committees.
.The Committee notes, in addition, the information supplied by the Government concerning the numerous trade unionists who were detained. According to this information a certain number have been released. It takes note of the fact that, according to the Government's communication dated  October , certain accusations are unfounded, since the authorities possess no relevant records, in particular as regards  persons whose names are cited by the complainants; no requests for an inquiry into their disappearance have been lodged with the competent national authorities. Generally speaking, the Committee considers that allegations relating to the arrest or presumed disappearance of trade unionists should as far as possible be based on precise information (trade union membership and/or functions, place of residence, date and circumstances of the arrest or disappearance, etc.) in order to make it easier to obtain information on the situation of the persons mentioned. As regards the persons in respect of whom the Government states that it has no information the Committee is willing to resume examination of their cases if it is provided with more detailed information. As regards Hugo Pereira (Building workers' leader) who, according to certain allegations had died as a result of ill-treatment, the Committee would like the Government to indicate whether investigations have been made into the circumstances of his death, and the results of these investigations.
.The Government further limits itself - except in certain cases - to quoting sections of the ordinary or military penal codes under which trade unionists have been prosecuted or sentenced by military courts, that is to say it indicates the kind of acts committed, but it does not supply details of the specific offences with which they are charged in each case; nor has it communicated the texts of the judgements rendered in their cases, as requested by the Governing Body in a number of cases. The Committee wishes to recall that at an earlier stage of examination of this case the Government supplied information of this kind during a direct contacts mission. This absence of information makes it impossible for the Committee to determine whether the persons concerned were sentenced - often to long terms of imprisonment - for acts unconnected with their trade union membership or activities.
.Furthermore, although the number of prisoners who have been judged by the courts is increasing, many trade unionists are still awaiting trial; some of them have been doing so for long periods in this respect the Committee wishes once again to express its concern at the slowness of the judicial procedure. Furthermore, it notes that Mr. Hctor Enrique Altesor Hafliger is said to be still in prison after the decision to abandon legal proceedings against him.
.Finally, the Government has not replied to the new allegations concerning ill-treatment inflicted on prisoners in order to obtain confessions from them, and regarding the precarious nature of the right to defence (paragraphs  and ). Detailed replies on this vitally important aspect of the case would enable the Committee to ascertain whether the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are enjoying full guarantees as regards the conditions of their imprisonment and the right to defence. In this respect the Committee wishes to stress that the purpose of the entire procedure which has been instituted is to secure respect for freedom of association de jure as well as de facto; it is convinced that, while this procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, the latter should in turn recognise the importance for their own reputations of collaborating fully with the Committee - as the Uruguayan Government has done on many occasions during earlier stages of this case - in order to enable it to make a thorough investigation of the facts and to seek solutions to the problems which have arisen.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the forthcoming legislation on occupational associations:(i) to express its concern at the slowness in adopting legislation based on the principles of freedom of association;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government, in particular, to the fact that the obligation imposed on trade union leaders by the draft legislative decree on occupational associations to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"", could give rise to abuses, as stated in paragraph  above;(iii) to request the Government to indicate the date on which it envisages the adoption and application of the final text of the law;(b) as regards the joint Committees provided for under a Decree of , and subject to what is stated in paragraph  above to note that the number of these in operation has noticeably increased and to request the Government to continue to provide information on developments in the situation concerning these Committees;(c) as regards the arrested trade unionists:(i) to note the most recent information provided by the Government and that a certain number of these persons have been released;(ii) to regret, however, the absence of additional information from the Government on the precise allegations made against the trade unionists who have been prosecuted or sentenced (including copies of the judgements) and the absence of the observations of the Government on the allegations concerning ill-treatment of prisoners and obstruction of their right of defence;(iii) to request the Government to communicate detailed information on the situation of the trade unionists listed in the annex in respect of whom it has not yet supplied details, and on the investigations made in the cases of Hugo Pereyra (paragraph ) and on the present situation of Altesor Hafliger (who is said to have been kept in prison following the dismissal of the case by the courts);(d) to request the Government to transmit information and observations on the points mentioned in clauses (a), (b) and (c), if possible by  January at the latest; and(e) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.For the first time the Committee has invited the authorities of the country concerned and the complainant organisations to supply orally, in the course of one of its meetings, detailed information concerning the case. The representatives of the Minister of Labour and those of the WCL and the WFTU began by making a statement; thereafter they replied to questions put to them. The Committee wishes-to express its thanks to the representatives of the Government and to those of the complainant organisations for their co-operation. It considers that this procedure has proved useful. It wishes to stress, however, that this procedure is in no way designed to pronounce judgement against a government but that its purpose is to permit an exchange of views which may contribute to the ascertainment of the facts and to a greater respect for trade union rights.
.The exchanges of views dealt mainly with the guidelines of the draft law on occupational associations. The Committee considers that this document contains positive aspects such as the right of occupational associations to be constituted without prior authorisation. Certain basic ideas contained in the bill should however be made more precise taking account of the standards contained in the Conventions on freedom of association. Without making a detailed analysis at this stage of the guidelines, the Committee wishes to emphasise in particular the guarantees contained in Article  of Convention No. , namely that organisations of workers and employers should be able to establish and join federations and Confederations. It also considers that the obligation on trade union leaders of occupational associations to make a declaration, as provided in the Guidelines (paragraph ), ""to uphold democracy"" could lead to abuses since such a provision does not include any precise criteria on the basis of which a judicial decision could be taken if a trade union leader was accused of having disregarded the declaration.
.The Committee notes the statement that the bill will be finalised in the near future. It trusts that the bill will be drafted prior to its session in November  and that, as the Government previously promised, it will transmit a copy of the text so that the Committee may examine this.
.As regards the present situation, the",1,1973,Uruguay
149,"Committee has noted the slowness with which the joint Committees referred to in the decree of  February  have been set up. As the Committee has already pointed out, although it considers that these bodies cannot substitute for trade union organisations, they can play a useful role in the field of industrial relations. The workers representatives of these Committees should also be freely elected and they should not be able to be kept out of the Committees because of their past trade union activities. Furthermore, there should also be such Committees for the public sector.
.It also appears from the information communicated by the Government on the arrested trade unionists (mentioned in the annex to the th Report) that most of them are still awaiting trial; nevertheless a number of them have been judged and sentenced to terms of imprisonment (one has been released because he had completed his term taking account of the time spent under preventive detention). Others have been released (one acquitted for lack of evidence). There are a number of divergences between the latest information supplied by the Government and the information transmitted by it earlier.
.The Committee has noted once again with concern the slowness of the judicial procedure concerning detained trade unionists. It has noted for example that of the  persons to which paragraph  refers in particular  still await trial, in some cases for several years now, and only  have been provisionally released.
.Nevertheless certain trade unionists have been brought to trial and sentenced on account of subversive activities. The Committee wishes to receive in these cases a copy of the judgements together with the grounds adduced therefor which have been handed down concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph . In fact, as it previously recalled, in the present case it is for the Committee itself to decide on the basis of the information available, and above all the texts of the judgements, whether these trade unionists were sentenced for common law crimes or for trade union activities. It could be the case in fact that acts which are legitimate as regards the principles of freedom of association may be at any given time considered as illegal under national law or by the authorities whose duty it is to apply it.
.In addition, the Government has not provided sufficient details in reply to the serious allegation that Mr. Ricardo Vilaro has been again imprisoned by the armed forces immediately after being released by the courts. Moreover, the representatives of the WCL and the WFTU made statements concerning the conditions of detention as well as of the rights of defence and submitted lists of numerous persons, mainly trade union leaders, who are alleged to have been arrested or who have disappeared. The names of the persons in respect of whom the complainants have given details as to their trade union affiliation and their trade union activities or functions will be communicated to the Government.
.Finally, certain allegations referred to the ill treatment which detained trade unionists are said to have suffered even recently (case of Mr. Iguini). The Committee has in the present case already expressed its strong disapproval of any vexations or brutality inflicted on any prisoners. It has also pointed out to the Government the importance which it attaches to all measures being taken including the giving of specific instructions and the imposition of exemplary penalties in order to guarantee that no person detained is subject to ill treatment.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the legislation on occupational associations:(i) to request the Government to indicate the date on which it envisages the adoption and the bringing into force of the final text of the law;(ii) to note that according to the representatives of the Government the draft bill on trade unions will be completed in the near future and to express the hope that the Government will be able to communicate a copy thereof prior to the Committee's next session in November ;(b) as regards the joint Committees set up under a decree of :(i) to stress, as stated in paragraph , the importance of guaranteeing the free election of workers to these Committees;(ii) to request the Government to supply information on the evolution of the situation as regards these bodies;(c) as regards the arrested trade unionists:(i) to note the latest information communicated by the Government;(ii) to express once again its concern at the slowness of the judicial procedures in the cases of numerous trade unionists who are still detained;(iii) to request the Government to transmit a copy of the judgements, together with the grounds adduced therefor, which have been handed down concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph ;(iv) to request the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations (mentioned in paragraphs  and ) relating to the ill-treatment suffered during detention as well as regarding the obstacles to the rights of defence and to provide detailed information on the specific case (mentioned in paragraph ) of Mr. Ricardo Vilaro, at the same time giving the reasons for his renewed detention;(v) to request the Government also to communicate detailed information on the trade unionists who appear on the lists submitted by the complainants which will be communicated to it in the near future;(d) to request the Government to transmit the information requested above not later than  October ;(e) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.At its session in November , the Committee had noted that the Government had referred once again to the subversive activities with which it had had to cope as an explanation for the exceptional measures taken, and had added that the process of normalisation of trade union activity had to be analysed within the wider concept of political and institutional normalisation within the country. The Committee wished to emphasise in this connection that although respect for freedom of association is closely bound up, as was stated by the International Labour Conference in , with respect for civil liberties in general, it is nevertheless important, with this reservation, to distinguish between the recognition of freedom of association and questions relating to a country's political evolution. The Committee had added that there should be no confusion between trade unions' performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers, and the possible pursuit by certain of their members of other activities having nothing to do with trade union functions. The penal responsibility which such persons may incur by such acts should in no way result in measures amounting to depriving the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action.
.The Committee had regretted that despite the time which had elapsed the trade union organisations were still encountering serious difficulties. In particular, the trade union legislation announced on several occasions still had not been adopted. The Government had pointed out, however, in a communication dated November  that the trade union question would be examined by it at the highest level as from  November . The Committee had taken note of this statement. It had recalled that, in November  already, the Governing Body had called the Government's attention, on the recommendation of the Committee, to the importance which it attached to the rapid adoption and application of trade union legislation in keeping with the provisions of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Uruguay, taking into account in particular the comments made by the Committee itself in a previous cases and by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The Committee had considered that the continuing existence of serious divergences between the Conventions on freedom of association on the one hand and legislation and national practice on the other was a matter for great concern. It considered it urgent that the Government permit a return to normal trade union activity and remove the related legal and factual restrictions. The adoption and implementation of new trade union legislation would undoubtedly constitute a decisive step in this direction.
.The Committee had noted the information provided by the Government regarding the detention of certain trade unionists. With particular reference to the persons whom the Director-General's representative was able to see and whose files he was able to examine during his last visit to Uruguay, no judgement had been rendered since that mission, although many of the persons in question had been imprisoned for many months, if not years. The Committee had recalled that the Director-General's representative had already noted, during his first visit to Uruguay, that initial inquiries and investigations were slow moving. The Committee could only express its concern in view of the continuing existence of such a situation. It had considered that although the fact of exercising trade union activity or holding trade union office does not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the prolonged detention of trade unionists without them being promptly tried can constitute a serious handicap to the",-1,1973,Uruguay
150,"exercise of trade union rights.
.In view of all these circumstances, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body, inter alia:(a) to regret that despite the time which had elapsed, the trade union organisations were still encountering serious difficulties and that the new trade union legislation announced on several occasions had still not been enacted;(b) to note, however, with interest the Government's statement contained in a recent communication that the trade union question would soon be examined by the Government at the highest level;(c) to urge the Government to permit a rapid return to normal trade union life and adopt for this purpose legislation respecting the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay;(d) regarding the detention of trade unionists:(i) to note the information communicated by the Government, but state its concern at the slowness of court procedure and the fact that no judgement had been pronounced since the last visit of the Director-General's representative, regarding, in particular, persons who had not yet been brought to trial, whom the Director-General's representative had been able to see or whose files he had been able to examine during his second mission in Uruguay;(ii) to call the Government's attention to the considerations set out regarding the detention of trade unionists and to request it to transmit the texts of the judgements and the grounds adduced therefor in respect of the trade unionists mentioned in subparagraph (i) who had not yet been brought to trial;(iii) regarding the persons mentioned in the Annex, in respect of whom the Government had asked for further information, to request the latter to continue its search for information on their situation and to invite the complainants to supply any additional information which they might possess in this connection;(iv) regarding the persons mentioned in the Annex, in respect of whom the Government had not yet transmitted information, to request it to communicate this information as soon as possible;(e) to request the Government to submit by  February  at the latest information on the evolution of the trade union situation, including the new legislation, and on the persons referred to in subparagraph (d).
.In its communication dated  December , the Government states that at its meeting at the highest level it decided ""to legislate in the near future, in the light of the experience acquired through the working of the joint Committees, on the status and functioning of occupational associations, defining their scope and precluding any politicisation"". The necessary steps have been taken to enable the study of such legislation to be started.
.In its communication dated  January  the Government provides information about the following persons mentioned by the Committee in its last report: Santana Coronel, Dario, released on  July ; Toledo Perlas, Pedro Hector, brought to trial on  February  under article () of the Military Penal Code before the military judge of the first instance (first chamber); Bentaberry Benitez, Eugenio, released in October ; prosecuted again on  February  under article () of the Military Penal Code; Cuesta Villa, Gerardo, brought to trial under article () and () in connection with article (), subparagraph , of the Military Penal Code before the military magistrate (fourth chamber); Marotta Rienzi, Antonio, brought to trial on  August  under article () of the Military Penal Code before the military magistrate (fourth chamber). The Government requests additional information concerning Soria, Carlos and Villalba. Finally, the Government states that, due to the fact that the courts were not in session during the annual January holiday, it was unable to request more information. Further details will be communicated as soon as possible.
.In a communication dated  February  the Government supplied a long list of detained persons who were released provisionally or unconditionally in . A certain number of persons provisionally released are trade unionists mentioned in several of the complaints.
.The Government also indicates in its communication of  February  that the Minister of Labour has been entrusted with the setting up of a Committee to draft a Bill concerning trade union organisations. The first responsibility of this Committee will be to draw up guidelines for this Bill, the draft of which will be transmitted to the ILO as well as to the representative organisations of workers and employers. The Government insists that it decided to legislate in the near future and that this task will accompany the institutional restructuring which the Government is determined to carry out. In this connection it was decided in August  that national elections will take place in November , and that measures for this purpose will be taken as from . It was also decided to accentuate government efforts to consolidate and accelerate the development of the economic and social sectors.
.The Committee takes note, first of all, of the decision taken by the Government at its highest level to legislate on the status and the functioning of occupational associations. A Committee has been appointed to draft the appropriate legislation. The Government insists that it has decided to legislate in the near future and transmit the draft trade union law to the ILO. It appears, however, that the outcome of this task will depend on developments concerning the institutional restructuring of the country.
.The Committee also notes all the information supplied by the Government regarding the detention of trade unionists. This latest information shows that a certain number of trade unionists have been provisionally released, that one has been released unconditionally and that court proceedings have been instituted against others. The Committee is obliged, however, to observe that the Government has not supplied information on the majority of the trade unionists mentioned in the previous report. In particular, no judgements have been pronounced in respect of the persons against whom proceedings have been instituted before the military tribunals. Finally, the Committee notes that the complainants have not forwarded additional information regarding some of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints as requested by the Committee.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the information provided by the Government concerning a certain number of trade unionists, mentioned by the complainants, who have been provisionally liberated, and concerning the decisions taken to prepare new trade union legislation;(b) to regret that the Government has sent no new information concerning the majority of the trade unionists mentioned in the Committee's last report and to express once again its concern at the slowness of the judicial proceedings as regards the numerous trade unionists who are still in detention;(c) to express also its concern at the delay with which the new trade union legislation, which has been announced on a number of previous occasions, and the preparation of which is only now to be undertaken, can be brought into force; to note the Government's promise that the draft trade union law will be transmitted to the ILO and to point out the importance which it attaches to this legislation being in conformity with the freedom of association Conventions ratified by Uruguay;(d) to request the Government to transmit, not later than  April , detailed information particularly concerning the trade unionists mentioned in the annex as well as concerning the progress made in the preparation of new trade union legislation;(e) in order to have more precise information regarding the situation, to invite the Minister of Labour, or if he cannot be available, his representative to supply orally to the Committee, at its meeting in May , detailed information on the evolution of the situation and on the prospects for a rapid return to a normal trade union situation;(f) to invite also the complainant organisations which have consultative status with the ILO to provide oral information at the next meeting of the Committee;(g) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, chairman.
.It should be recalled first of all that the conclusions submitted by the Committee in May  followed a second direct contacts mission to the country, from  to  April  by a representative of the Director-General.
.The Committee noted that there had been no change in the legal situation of trade unions since the representative of the Director-General carried out his first mission. Nevertheless, the factual situation had changed: there had been improvement in the situation of the unions affiliated to the General Confederation of Workers of Uruguay (CGTU) which had been able to perform certain internal activities (meetings, elections, etc.). On the other hand, the unions affiliated to the National Workers' Convention (CNT), which had been dissolved by the Government after the change of regime in , appeared to remain to a large extent inactive; many of their leaders were detained, had left the country, or had been dismissed. The premises of certain unions were under police control, closed, under surveillance, etc. As for industrial relations activities, the extent of recognition of the unions of the CGTU and their leaders depended on whether or not they were on good terms with the employers or the heads of their public administrative services. On",0,1973,Uruguay
151,"the contrary, the unions affiliated to the CNT did not appear to be recognised in either the private or the public sectors.
.The Government had once again indicated its concern for a return to a normal trade union situation. According to the Government, the delay in adopting new trade union legislation was due to the discovery of certain subversive activities in preparation, including the storage of arms (in which several trade unionists had taken part), to the political crisis of  and to economic and political considerations. The Government considered that the trade union question was only part of the problem of the country's political institutions. Furthermore, the reduction of trade union activity and industrial peace had, according to it, contributed to certain economic progress being made it stated that it was preparing new trade union legislation, the main aspects of which were being studied, and it hoped that progress would be made during the year .
.The Committee recalled that the Government had previously invoked considerations of a political and economic nature during the first mission of the representative of the Director-General to explain the restrictions placed on trade unions and their activities. The Committee expressed its concern that these considerations continued to hinder the re-establishment of a normal trade union situation. The Government possessed various legal means to deal with the subversive activities of specific persons. As for the problem of the political institutions in the country and their future evolution, the Committee considered that the workers' and employers' organisations had their proper and specific functions to perform, their object being to defend the occupational interests of their members. The requirements of development should not justify maintaining the entire trade union movement of a country in a legally irregular situation, thereby preventing the workers from exercising their trade union rights, as well as preventing organisations from carrying out their normal activities. A balanced economic and social development requires the existence of strong and independent organisations which can participate in the process. The Committee noted, in this connection, that all the members of the Government interviewed by the Director-General's representative and also the employers took the view that it was essential to have as interlocutors trade unions which defend the occupational interests of their members.
.The Committee added that the Government authorities and the employers should refrain from any discrimination between trade union organisations, especially as regards recognition of their leaders seeking to perform legitimate trade union activities. It recalled that, on the one hand, workers and their organisations were bound to respect the law and that, on the other hand, the law of the land should not be such as to impair, nor should it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in Convention No. . In placing certain organisations at a disadvantage where these organisations were carrying out legitimate activities, a government could influence workers in the choice of the organisation to which they might wish to belong, and if this were done deliberately, it would infringe the standards contained in the Convention and in particular the principle that workers have the right to establish and join organisations o?their own choosing. In that connection the Committee noted, for example, that one trade union office remained closed although several persons who had taken part in illegal activities in that office were subsequently released by the military judge, that other offices remained guarded, closed, placed under supervision, etc. in spite of the time that had elapsed since the events which led to those measures, that no leader of any union affiliated to the CNT was recognised in practice either by the authorities or by the employers, that some of those leaders had been detained on a number of occasions for carrying out activities of a trade union nature and that all or several members of executive Committees of unions had been dismissed.
.The Committee noted that the joint Committees set up by decree of  February  had not started to function in practice (whilst the elected members of a similar joint Committee, in the FUNSA undertaking, had taken over their functions). According to the Government, those Committees should be considered as representing a stage in the process of promulgating trade union legislation. While the Committee considered that those Committees could not replace trade union organisations, it was also of the view that the workers' representatives on those bodies should be freely elected and should not be liable to be dismissed from them unless they had committed an offence or carried out an illegal activity that would be prejudicial to the proper exercise of their functions as members of those Committees.
.Regarding the detention of trade unionists, the Committee noted, in particular, that according to the report of the Director-General's representative, there had been a decrease in the number of those detained on account of acts linked with trade union activities. The report also contained detailed information on the specific facts for which the remaining detained trade unionists, which he had been able to see, stood accused, or whose files he had been able to examine. These persons were: Bentaberry Benitez, Eugenio; Cayotta Zappettini, Victor Eugenio; Coitiho Cebey, Carlos Dioniso; Cuesta Villa Gerardo; Delgado Larrosa, Freddy; Fassano Martens, Carlos Ignacio; Genovese Cortazar, Omar Isaac; Gershuni Prez, Jaime; Gonzalez Cardozo, Jorge Ral; Gidotti Luscher, Luis; Iguini Ferreira, Luis Alberto; Marotta Rienzi, Antonio; Ormaechea de Len, Juan Jose; Prez Baccino, Didasko; Rezzano, Alicia Maria; Rodriguez da Silva, Hector Pio; Rubio Bruno, Enrique Vicente; Turiansky, Vladimir Ilitch; Via, Beltram Pablo Camilo. The Committee noted that some of these persons had been arrested in connection with matters which could be considered as being linked to trade union activities. In the remaining cases, the information gathered, although incomplete, gave the impression that the criminal procedures set in motion by the authorities were aimed first of all at activities of a political character considered by the Government to endanger security and public order. The Director-General's representative pointed out, however, that some of the charges were linked to the activities of the CNT, which had been dissolved by the Government in .
.The Committee noted the information provided in the report, on the allegations of ill-treatment of detained trade unionists. In particular, the information related to specific cases, which came to his attention, of brutality inflicted on prisoners who were subsequently accused of crimes of subversive association or giving assistance to subversive bodies. Moreover, the report continued, it could not be affirmed that these practices were systematic. According to the authorities, there were cases where officials were censured for such acts and, in the case of one prisoner who died, the guard responsible was prosecuted for culpable homicide.
.The Committee expressed its strong disapproval of any vexations or brutality inflicted on any prisoner, and called attention to the importance which it has always attached to the fact that trade unionists, like any other persons, are entitled to the guarantees of normal judicial procedure in accordance with the principles contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee had already referred to the question of ill-treatment in its rd Report, following the first visit of the Director-General's representative it insisted again that the Government take all the necessary steps, including not only specific instructions, but also the imposition of exemplary penalties, in order to guarantee that no person detained was subjected to ill-treatment. The Committee noted that, as indicated by the Director-General's representative, the authorities were making efforts to instruct the police in methods to ensure better treatment for persons during interrogation and at all other times.
.Consequently, the Governing Body had decided, on the Committee's recommendation:(a) regarding the trade union situation, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set out in paragraphs  and , to urge it to proceed without delay to the restoration of a normal situation and to adopt, for this purpose, legislation which would be in conformity with the Conventions ratified by Uruguay;(b) regarding the joint Committees, subject to the considerations expressed in paragraph , to point out that it is important to ensure the free election of workers' representatives in those Committees;(c) regarding the detention of trade unionists, to note the information obtained from the Government by the representative of the Director-General on the acts of which the persons detained stood accused, and which, according to the Government, were linked to activities of a political character; to note also that several trade unionists who were being prosecuted had been released by the courts;(d) to point out, however, the importance of no person being detained on account of his trade union activities and to request the Government to transmit, as soon as they were available, the texts of the judgements and the grounds adduced therefor, that are rendered in the cases of persons not already tried, referred to in paragraph ;(e) to note that there had again been several cases of brutality inflicted on prisoners: to note also the statement by the Government that efforts were being made to instruct the",0,1973,Uruguay
152,"police in methods to ensure better treatment for detainees; to recall the importance it attached to the Government taking all the necessary steps, including not only specific instructions, but also the imposition of exemplary penalties, to guarantee that no person detained was subject to ill-treatment;(f) to decide, taking account of the information provided by the representative of the Director-General, that it would not be appropriate at that stage to establish a Commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint presented under article  of the Constitution;(g) to request the Government to transmit information on the development of the situation and on the trade union legislation.
.The International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Associations reported in its communications the arrest of Julio Garcia and Pedro Aldrovandi, trade union leaders in the milk and sugar industries, respectively. According to the complainants, the latter, who was admitted to hospital a short while ago for a hemiplegia, was arrested in Montevideo at the beginning of June, then transferred to the department of Salto. The Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers stated that reprisals had been taken against leaders and militants of its affiliated organisation, the Glass Workers' Federation of Montevideo. It gave the names of several persons who had already been mentioned in preceding complaints, and those of Oscar Rodriguez, Celestino Lopez and Julio Santos, works delegates. The Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers' Trade Unions: international reported the arrest and disappearance since the beginning of July  of Juan Angel Toledo, secretary of the Textile Workers' Congress and member of the administrative Committee of the complainant organisation.
.The Government provided information or observations in its various communications on many persons regarding whom information had been requested from it in recent or older complaints. This information is summarised in the annex. In particular, it provided information on the state of progress of the court action undertaken against the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph , with the exception of Jorge Raul Gonzlez Cardozo; no sentence has been pronounced since the visit of the Director-General's representative.
.The Government also recalled its earlier statements concerning the normalisation of occupational relations in accordance with the various items mentioned in its communication of  October . It stated that it was devoting itself to the restructuration of the country's institutions and referred again to the moral vacuum, ideological infiltration and armed attack with which it had to deal and which constituted the reasons for the exceptional measures taken to protect the State and the country's historical continuity. Normalisation in occupational organisations, therefore, formed part, accordingly, of a wider context and, in order to be understood, the measures taken by the Government had to be analysed within the general framework of the political and institutional normalisation announced.
.As part of these measures, continued the Government, reference should be made to the Decree of  February  setting up joint Committees at the level of private undertakings. Section  of that Decree was subsequently modified by the Decree of  August  enabling the competent authorities to set up such Committees whenever they, think it appropriate in the public interest, in undertakings in which they had not been set up spontaneously. The Government's intention was that these Committees should serve as a stimulus for formation of the leadership necessary as part of the system required for the normalisation referred to. However, it continued, there also existed, as pointed out in the report of the Director-General's representative, an important trade union core which was at present operating correctly, performing its normal activities.
.The Government added that two facts confirmed its stated line of action:(a) Act No. . of  July  and its enabling Decree No. / of  January  re-establish a Conventional sickness insurance system. This legislation provides for participation machinery with bipartite administration. Workers can express their desires through elections by secret ballot;(b) a decree is to be passed shortly, setting up a bipartite consultative Committee for the merchant navy, which embodies the principles contained in the Placing of Seamen Convention,  (No. ). According to the Government, these two facts demonstrated its desire to adopt measures permitting the slow but sure regularisation of trade union organisations in the country.
.The Government added that it would keep the ILO fully informed of the measures taken in the future until trade union activity had finally been restored to normal. The measures already taken reflected the desire to give effect to the four basic principles guiding the building up of the new legislation in this field. The Government referred, amongst these, to the worker's recognised right to elect his representatives to serve on the various Committees referred to; the guarantee of a secret ballot, the occupational status of eligible workers, the consideration to be shown by these Committees for occupational problems, all of which showed serious and clear progress towards the new institutionalisation of occupational relations. The Government concluded that this should provide the best safeguard, since it was based not only on legislation, but also on practical experience within the country. The Government pointed out in its communication of  November  that the question of trade unions was on the agenda of the meeting it would hold at the highest level as from  November .
.In its latest communication of  November  the Government stated, in particular, that the extraordinary general meeting of the CGTU had recently taken place and that it had elected a new executive council at that meeting.
.The Committee takes note of the information supplied. The Government refers once again to the subversive activities with which it had to cope as an explanation for the exceptional measures taken and adds that the regularisation of trade union activity is to be analysed within the wider concept of political and institutional normalisation within the country. The Committee wishes to emphasise in this connection that although respect for freedom of association is closely bound up, as was stated by the International Labour Conference in , with respect for civil liberties in general, it is nevertheless important, with this reservation, to distinguish between the recognition of freedom of association and questions relating to a country's political evolution. Neither should there be confusion between trade unions' performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers, and the possible pursuit by certain of their members of other activities having nothing to do with trade union functions. The penal responsibility which such persons may incur by such acts should in no way result in measures amounting to depriving the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action.
.The Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed the trade union organisations are still encountering serious difficulties. In particular, the trade union legislation announced on several occasions still has not been adopted. The Government points out, however, in its latest communication that the trade union question will be examined by it at the highest level as from  November . The Committee takes note of this statement. It recalls that, in November  already, the Governing Body had called the Government's attention, on the recommendation of the Committee, to the importance which it attached to the rapid adoption and application of trade union legislation in keeping with the provisions of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Uruguay, taking into account in particular the comments made by the Committee itself in a previous case and by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The Committee considers that the continuing existence of serious divergences between the Conventions on freedom of association on the one hand and legislation and national practice on the other is a matter for great concern. It considers it urgent that the Government permit a return to normal trade union activity and remove the related legal and factual restrictions. The adoption and implementation of new trade union legislation would undoubtedly constitute a decisive step in this direction.
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government regarding the detention of certain trade unionists. With particular reference to the persons whom the Director-General's representative was able to see and whose files he was able to examine during his last visit to Uruguay, no judgement has been rendered since that mission, although many of the persons in question have been imprisoned for many months, if not years. The Committee recalls that the Director-General's representative already noted, during his first visit to Uruguay, that initial inquiries and investigations were slow-moving. The Committee can but express its concern in view of the continuing existence of such a situation. It considers that although the fact of exercising trade union activity or holding trade union office does not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the prolonged detention of trade unionists without them being promptly tried can constitute a serious handicap to the exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret that despite the time which has elapsed, the",0,1973,Uruguay
153,"trade union organisations are still encountering serious difficulties and that the new trade union legislation announced on several occasions still has not been enacted;(b) to note, however, with interest the Government's statement contained in a recent communication that the trade union question will soon be examined by the Government at the highest level:(c) to urge the Government to permit a rapid return to normal trade union life and to adopt for this purpose legislation respecting the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay;(d) regarding the detention of trade unionists:(i) to note the information communicated by the Government, but state its concern for the slowness of court procedure and the fact that no judgement has been pronounced since the last visit of the Director-General's representative, regarding, in particular, the persons who have not yet been tried, mentioned in paragraph ;(ii) to call the Government's attention to the considerations set out in paragraph  and to request it to transmit the texts of the judgements and the grounds adduced therefor in respect of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph , who have not yet been brought to trial, especially as regards those who have been in detention for a number o?years;(iii) regarding the persons, mentioned in the Annex, in respect of whom the Government has asked for further information, to request the latter to continue its search for information on their situation and to invite the complainants to supply any additional information which they may possess in this connection;(iv) regarding the persons, mentioned in the Annex, in respect of whom the Government has not yet transmitted information, to request it to communicate this information as soon as possible;(e) to request the Government to submit by I February  at the latest information on the evolution of the trade union situation, including the new legislation, and on the persons referred to in subparagraph (d);(f) to take note, in the meantime, of the present interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The last time the Committee considered these cases was at its meeting in November , when it submitted a report on them (rd Report, paragraphs  to ). This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session in November .
.After analysing the information available to it through the direct contacts procedure used in these cases, the Committee took the view that, in view of the nature of the case it would be appropriate and desirable for it to continue to follow developments in the trade union situation in Uruguay, and the effect given to its own recommendations, in accordance with the procedure in force. It accordingly recommended the Governing Body to invite the Government to submit full information before the Governing Body's Session in February  with regard to the action already taken or contemplated with a view to complying with the Committee's recommendations, and to forward its observations on the questions and allegations still outstanding.
.The Government sent two communications dated  January  in answer to this request, and in response to new complaints made by various complainant organisations.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In view of all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret that, in spite of the statement made by the Minister of Labour in June , the Government has still taken no practical steps to restore the trade union situation to normal, so that the workers' occupational organisations and their members can benefit properly from the safeguards and fully exercise the rights set forth in the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay;(b) to reaffirm the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , namely that ""workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority"";(c) while noting the release of several workers and trade unionists previously detained, to draw the Government's attention to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above and, in particular, to the danger involved for trade union rights when trade unionists are arrested and no grounds for conviction are subsequently found;(d) to take note of the information supplied by the Government about certain of the trade unionists detained, and to request the Government for the information still outstanding, and especially for the decisions taken with regard to the persons concerned, together with copies of the judgments rendered, with the reasons adduced;(e) to take note of the Government's statement concerning the allegations of ill-treatment, to reaffirm the importance of issuing specific instructions on the subject for the primary purpose of preventing any possible practices of this kind, and to request the Government for the information mentioned in paragraph  above;(f) to ask the Government for its detailed comments on the occupation and searching of trade union premises, referred to in paragraph  above;(g) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the information requested.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association has been examining various complaints alleging breaches of trade union rights in Uruguay, presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Confederation of Labour, the Uruguayan National Workers' Convention, the Latin American Workers' Confederation, the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers, the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Public Services and Allied Occupations, the Trades Union International of Workers in the Metal Industries, the World Federation of Teachers' Unions, the Latin American Federation of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, the International Federation of Actors, the Uruguayan Medical Trade Union and the Montevideo Bus Company. Almost all these complaints are combined in Case No. , regarding which the Committee has submitted four interim reports to the Governing Body which appear in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report. These reports were approved by the Governing Body at its meetings of November , February-March , November  and March , respectively.
.In the latter of these reports, the Committee pointed out that it was confronted with a situation which raises important problems in relation to various basic principles of freedom of association and which seems to affect a large section of the trade union movement in Uruguay. The Committee also noted that new complaints were still being presented regarding the trade union situation in Uruguay and that the information supplied by the complainants and by the Government was largely contradictory. In these circumstances, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government's agreement, in accordance with the procedure for direct contacts previously adopted by the Committee in another country, for the appointment by the Director-General of a representative to examine, in Uruguay, the facts relating to the complaint and to report thereon to the Committee. This recommendation having been adopted by the Governing Body, the Uruguayan Government gave its consent in communications dated  and  May .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Philippe Cahier, Professor in the Institut universitaire de hautes tudes internationales in Geneva, who carried out his mission from  June to  July , accompanied by an official of the International Labour Office.
.The Committee studied the report presented by the Director-General's representative and noted, in particular, that he had received all the facilities necessary for the fulfilment of his mission in Uruguay and that he had been able to have many talks, especially with the authorities and with leaders of workers' and employers' organisations, including detained leaders. Before visiting the country, the Director-General's representative had interviews with Uruguayan governmental, employers' and workers' delegates attending the th Session of the International Labour Conference and with leaders of the National Workers' Convention living outside Uruguay.
.The Committee has examined the various complaints in the light of the report mentioned and wishes to state that the information obtained by the Director-General's representative has been a valuable help in its work.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Under these conditions, and with respect to the case as a whole, the Committee presents the following recommendations to the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to restrictions on freedom of association, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which should be attached to the rapid adoption and application of trade union legislation in keeping with the provisions of Convention No. , taking into account in particular the comments made by the Committee itself and by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in respect of Decree No. , governing trade union activities;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the",-1,1973,Uruguay
154,"dissolution of the National Workers' Convention, the Single National Union of Workers in the Building and Allied Trades and the Federation of Secondary School Teachers, to point out to the Government that, in dissolving these organisations by decree or resolution, it failed to observe the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Uruguay, and to stress the importance which it attaches to the respect of this standard;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or orders for arrest of trade union leaders and militants,(i) to note the release of the arrested trade unionists, mentioned in paragraph ;(ii) regarding Enrique Pastorino and Jos d'Elia, in view of the time which has elapsed since the events which gave rise to the warrants for arrest issued against them and taking into account the fact that the other CNT leaders who were arrested in application of the same provision have all been released, to request the Government to consider the possibility of cancelling this measure, and thus helping to solve the existing problems regarding freedom of association;(iii) as regards Mr. Vladimir Turiansky, to request the Government to be good enough to supply information concerning his situation in law and the measures taken in this connection.(iv) with regard to the trade unionists still under arrest or awaiting trial by military courts:- to reiterate the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are accused of offences of a political nature or under common law which the Government considers to have no bearing on their trade union functions or activities, the persons concerned should be tried as rapidly as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority;- to request the Government to notify it of the decision taken, or transmit the text of the judgments in respect of the trade unionists mentioned above in paragraph , indicating the grounds adduced therefor;- to request the Government to send information on the position of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph ;(v) regarding the allegations of ill-treatment, even if cases of ill-treatment might have been exceptional, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of taking all necessary measures, including specific instructions and effective sanctions, to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment;(d) with regard to the allegations concerning searches of trade union premises, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set out in paragraph , so that it may take the necessary measures to prevent possible abusive searches of trade union premises and bring about the return of impounded trade union property and the reopening of closed offices;(e) with regard to the allegations concerning anti-trade union discrimination, to draw attention to the principles and considerations set out in paragraphs  to , and to invite the Government to take appropriate measures in both the public and private sectors to ensure that there is no anti-trade union discrimination and, in particular, to give full application to the relevant provisions of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Uruguay;(f) to invite the Government, in accordance with the points mentioned in paragraph  above, to send complete information, before the February  meeting of the Committee, regarding the measures taken or planned to give effect to the recommendations made, and its observations on the outstanding questions and allegations;(g) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report for the next meeting of the Governing Body.
.As a result of complaints lodged by numerous trade union organisations, the Committee already considered this case at its sessions in November , February  and November  and on each occasion submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs - of its th Report, paragraphs - of its nd Report, and paragraphs - of its th Report, and were adopted by the Governing Body, respectively, at the latter's st Session (November ), nd Session (February-March ) and th Session (November ).
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Consequently, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to give its consent as soon as possible to the appointment of a representative by the Director-General to proceed to an examination in Uruguay of the facts relating to the complaints and to inform the Committee of the result of his mission.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.This case was last examined by the Committee at its session in February  when the Committee submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see nd Report of the Committee, paras. -).
.By a communication dated  March , the World Federation of Trade Unions transmitted a document from the National Workers' Convention of Uruguay containing additional information relating to the complaints. By two communications dated  and  April , the World Federation of Trade Unions transmitted additional information concerning the complaints. In addition, fresh allegations were submitted by the Trade Union International of Workers in the Metal Industries in a telegram dated  April . Further information in connection with the complaints was supplied by the National Workers' Convention of Uruguay in communications dated , ,  and  March,  April,  July, and  and  August . In further communications dated  April , the Medical Association of Uruguay transmitted additional information concerning the case. By a communication dated May , the Workers' Organisation of the Omnibus transmitted fresh allegations relating to the case. In another communication, transmitted to the ILO by the United Nations on  June , the Medical Association of Uruguay submitted further information in connection with the complaints. The International Federation of Actors, in communications dated  June,  and  July , submitted allegations and information relating to the case. A communication from the Union of Metalworkers dated  February , and transmitted to the ILO by the United Nations on  July , contained further information in connection with the complaints. These communications were transmitted to the Government for observations.
.The Government transmitted certain observations on the complaints in a communication dated  June .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined this case (in February ), the Committee noted that the allegations which had been made dealt mainly with the arrest of trade union leaders and the dissolution by decree of the National Workers' Convention. In view of the nature of the allegations and information which have now been received, the Committee considers it appropriate to summarise the allegations already examined, as well as the Government's observations thereon, before proceeding to analyse the information and allegations submitted to it since the case was last before it.Allegations relating to the Arrest of Trade Unionists, the Dissolution of the National Workers' Convention and General Intervention in Trade Union Matters
.The complainants had stated that numerous arrests had taken place and gave the names of some of the persons detained, in particular, those of Antonio Tornayo, a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention and a representative of the Uruguayan workers at the th Session of the International Labour Conference, who was stated to have been arrested on his return from the Conference; Felix Diaz, another leading figure in the Convention; Mario Acosta, General Secretary of the Building Workers' Federation and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of Workers in the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries; Daniel Baldassari, General Secretary of the Petroleum Workers' Federation and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers; Dr. Manuel Liberoff, Treasurer of the Medical Association of Uruguay, and five other leading figures in that union: Juan J.

.The WFTU alleged that  trade union leaders were being sought by the police, including Jos d'Elia, President, and Vladimir. Turiansky, Vice-President of the National Workers' Convention, and Enrique Pastorino, President of the WFTU in all, some l, workers had been arrested and threatened with trial by military, courts, according to the WFTU. The latter also provided a list of  arrested trade union leaders, while the WCL sent a list (which it describes as incomplete) of  persons arrested.
.In its communication dated  October , the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers stated that on  June  the authorities, with support from the armed forces, brutally broke up a strike by the oil workers, members of an affiliated trade union organisation, and placed the ANCAP refinery under military control. The headquarters of the trade union concerned had been closed and its meeting outlawed. Furthermore,",-1,1973,Uruguay
155,"the President of that union, Jons Stneri, had been arrested and a warrant had been issued for the arrests of Daniel Baldassari, General Secretary, and of the Secretary-Treasurer. Moreover, the other Uruguayan affiliated organisation - the Glass Workers' Federation - had allegedly been prevented from exercising its normal activities.
.The World Federation of Teachers, in a communication dated  November , asserted that the Uruguayan Government was continuing its repression of unionised teachers. The premises of teachers' unions had been broken into, typewriters and mimeograph machines destroyed and documents and records confiscated. It also claimed that Victor Cayota, President of the Secondary School Teachers' Federation, had been imprisoned.
.In a communication dated  November , the World Confederation of Labour provided a list (stated to be incomplete) of trade union leaders in custody for nearly five months. Apart from certain leaders already referred to, the following were being held in the Army Ordnance and Services College: Roberto Olmos, General Secretary, Trade Union of Graphic Arts; Hector Betancourt, a leading figure in the Transport Federation; Honorio Libner, a leader of the National Workers' Convention and Chairman of the National Federation of Municipal Employees; Aparicio Guzmn, a leader of the Trade Union of Graphic Arts; and Rubn Villaverde, a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention and the Federation of State Water Board Workers. The complainants also alleged that many workers were still locked up in barracks, the Montevideo police headquarters and local police stations and in the ""Cilindro Municipal"" Sports Stadium; some of their names are given. None of these persons had been sentenced or even brought to trial and, state the complainants, their only offence was to have defended the Constitution and freedom of association.
.In a communication dated  December , the Latin American Federation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries claimed that its affiliate in Uruguay, the National Union of Building and Allied Trades Workers, had had its headquarters forcibly occupied by troops, its funds had been confiscated and its meetings prohibited.
.The WFTU, the WCL and the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials industries further complained that the National Workers' Convention had been dissolved by decree. The decree in question, which was issued on  June , gave as the reason for dissolution the attitude of the leaders of the Convention, who were said to have encouraged and defended the use of violence and urged workers to occupy their workplaces; thereby obstructing public services and supplies.
.In a communication received by the ILO on  November , the Government replied by giving a general outline of the circumstances which, it stated, led to the arrest of the trade union leaders in question and the dissolution of the National Workers' Convention. In support of its comments, it transmitted an order approved by the Government on  June , dissolving the Convention, ordering its assets to be attached and its leaders to be arrested.
.In the above-mentioned communication, the Government began by declaring that it had for some considerable time been making every effort to devise a solution for the country's problems which, while offering the advantages of equity, would be in the best interests of the workers themselves. To this end it had held numerous direct talks with the various branches of the labour force, patiently encouraged constructive discussions among all Uruguayan organisations of employers and workers, proposed the creation of joint advisory Committees and suggested improvements in wages and working conditions. Many trade union organisations, and the vast majority of Uruguayan workers, had been very favourably impressed by these activities and the motives behind them.
.However, the Government continued, the National Workers' Convention, led by totalitarian extremists from minority groups, had opposed the Government's policy. It refused recognition of the right to work, championed violence, promoted the unlawful occupation of workplaces, both public and private, called for sabotage, encouraged continuous and very serious street disturbances, did its best to stop the flow of supplies to the people and tried to paralyse public services - indeed, work of any kind anywhere. What was at stake, in the Government's view, went considerably further than the success or failure of a strike. What was at issue was the success or failure of certain fanatically anti-democratic minority groups which had pushed the National Workers' Convention into the action described as a means of producing social chaos and a change in the political, economic and social life of the nation. Such opposition, the Government stated, could not possibly be justified by the defence of trade union interests of any kind; rather, it was prompted by ulterior motives of a notoriously political type, the prime aim being to destroy current institutions.
.The Government stated that recourse to violence cannot be admitted in any organised society and must be utterly and vigorously condemned. In this connection it noted that article () of the Uruguayan Constitution requires suspension of citizenship where a national belongs to political or social organisations which attempt to destroy the foundations of the national community either by violence or by propaganda advocating violence.
.The Government recalled further that article  of the Uruguayan Constitution entitles any persons to associate for any purpose provided the association be not unlawful. Act No.  (of  July ) defines an unlawful association as one which advocates violence against the institutions of the Republic or against the civil authorities. Section  of that Act provides for such an association to be dissolved and its leaders and members charged under the criminal law.
.These provisions, the Government added, clearly show that the National Workers' Convention had become an unlawful association in the above sense. Its activities could, under the Criminal Code, constitute rebellion, riotous assembly, public incitement to break the law and commit criminal acts, promotion of class hatred and contempt of the public authorities. It was for the criminal courts to define the offences and the criminal responsibility of the members and officers of the organisation.
.The Government's conduct in the present case was, it stated, justified in that, under the Constitution, it was responsible for keeping the peace and for taking prompt and vigorous action in the event of grave and unforeseen disturbance (article ,  and ). Moreover, section  of Act No.  (of  July ) empowers the Government to suspend meetings or activities in all premises, public or private, when such meetings or activities caused, or might cause, a breach of the peace. In view of this overriding duty to keep the peace, it was only natural that the Government should act by dissolving the National Workers' Convention and order the arrest and trial of its leaders by the competent criminal court.
.The Government, moreover, took the view that the allegations of infringement of ILO Conventions Nos.  and  could not be sustained. While Convention No.  does require the authorities to ""refrain from any interference which would restrict"" the rights of organisations or hamper the legitimate exercise of those rights, it does, on the other hand, lay down that ""in exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their respective organisations ... shall respect the law of the land"". The National Workers' Convention, however, had taken the view that its independence and freedom of action were such that it could with impunity overlook the law of the land and even attempt to overturn or destroy it. It ignored that defence of occupational interests for which trade unions exist in order to uphold certain political interests.
.Certainly, the Government continued, in any democratic society it was inevitable that the trade union movement be influenced by political parties. But it was essential to avoid a state of affairs in which the movement was used as a tool by some ideology or political faction and took decisions which did not unequivocally reflect the will of those who have freely come together in the defence of their interests.
.The points made in respect of the National Workers' Convention, The Government considered, could also be applied to the complaints from the Medical Association of Uruguay and the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Industries (concerning ANCAP, the state refinery). Lastly, it affirmed that the Government continued to abide by Conventions Nos.  and .
.The Governmental Order dated  June , attached to the Government's letter to the ILO, declares the National Workers' Convention to be an unlawful association and decrees its dissolution. Its premises were closed and its assets confiscated; bank deposits in its name or in that of its officers were frozen. These latter were to be placed under arrest and members and officers who had carried out acts presumed to be unlawful would be tried by the competent criminal court.
.In a further communication, dated  January , the Government stated that the imprisonment of Antonio Tamayo and the searches carried out for Enrique Pastorino were in no way related to their holding of union office. The Government stated that the arrest of Antonio Tamayo was ordered by the Executive",0,1973,Uruguay
156,"authorities pursuant to the declaration of a state of emergency (article () of the Constitution), and it was because he was presumed to have engaged in subversive activities harmful to the security of the State that Enrique Pastorino was being sought. In a more recent communication, dated  January , the Government stated that Mr. Tamayo had been set free at the end of December .
.With regard to the arrest of trade union leaders, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, took note of the Government's statement that Antonio Tamayo was set free in December , and drew the attention of the Government, in particular, to the principle that whenever trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions or activities, they should be given a prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal. The Governing Body also requested the Government to state whether proceedings had been instituted against all of these trade unionists and, if so, to provide details concerning the nature of the court dealing with the case and the stage the proceedings had reached, and to supply copies of the judgments, once they had been rendered, with the grounds adduced therefor.
.With regard to the dissolution of the National Workers' Convention, the Governing Body drew the attention of the Government to the importance it attaches to the principle that workers' organisations should not be subject to dissolution by administrative authority, and that likewise dissolution by the executive branch of the Government does not ensure the right of defence which normal judicial procedure alone can guarantee. The Governing Body also requested the Government for its observations on the alleged ban on activities by the Glass Workers' Federation and National Union of Workers of the Building and Allied Trades and on the measures taken against several teachers' organisations. In addition, the Governing Body requested the Government to send precise information on the nature of the acts of which Enrique Pastorino was accused.Further Allegations relating to the Arrest of Trade Unionists and General Intervention in Trade Union Matters
.In the communication from the National Workers' Convention, transmitted by the WFTU on  March , it is alleged that Sonia Guarnieri, leader of the Federation of Public Health Officials, was arrested in Brazil in September  and later handed over to the police of the Rivera area. She was then taken to Montevideo where she was tortured at police headquarters. The complainants state that this person had been sought by the police when the capture of the CNT leaders was ordered. She was arrested and kept in custody for over a month. According to the complainants, this person was imprisoned at the Eleventh Commissariat of Montevideo along with a number of other women trade unionists (including three from the Central Council for Family Allowances, leaders of the AFAF Union).
.Since  January , continue the complainants, Leon Duarte, Secretary of the Uruguayan Tyre Factory Union (FUNSA) has been held at the Military School, Rogelio Zorrn, a leader of the CNT and of the AUTE (Electricity and Telephone Workers) is being held in the premises of the Marine. The complainants supply a list of approximately forty trade unionists and their respective unions, who have been held at the stadium known as ""Cilindro Municipal"" since January or February . According to the complainants, the AUTE members, Luis Micheline Olivera and Heber Alonso, were tortured by the police and the latter had been taken from the ""Cilindro"" to a military prison.
.The complainants add that, on  February , the rgime published a document in which the names and photographs of the wanted trade union leaders were given. These included the entire Executive of the CNT. This document, state the complainants, was added to the normal editions of various newspapers.
.The WFTU, in its communication of  April , states that, according to the newspaper ""El Dial ( March ), the Secretariat of the Chief of Police of Montevideo, Colonel Alberto Ballestrino, issued an official communication suspending all authorisations for the holding of trade union meetings. The complainants continue that, on  March , the same newspaper published official Communication No.  of the Chief of the Montevideo Police, stating that ""applications for permission to hold trade union meetings must continue to be substantiated as in the past. After the applications have been considered, it will be decided in each specific case whether or not to grant permission to hold a meeting in accordance with the regulations in force"". The complainants allege that these two communications point clearly to the flagrant violation of the right of assembly of trade unions. Unions must, before holding a meeting, apply to the Chief of Police and to the Ministry of the Interior for permission to do so, and indicate the date, place and object of the meeting.
.In its communication of  April , the WFTU adds that, on  March , the offices of the National Union of Metallurgical and Allied Industries (UNTMRA), Montevideo, were occupied by the police and nine workers, who happened to be there, were arrested. On  March, the complainants continue, the offices of the Wool Workers' Federation were occupied and thirty-eight workers arrested. The Director of this Federation, state the complainants, comrade Freire Pizzano, was badly beaten up. On  March, the offices of the Consolidated Sea Transport Workers' Union were searched and nine workers arrested. Furthermore, state the complainants, Professor J. Bouton, leader of the medical Association, has been imprisoned after being under house arrest. No explanation has been given, add the complainants, for this action, nor is the present situation of Professor Bouton known.
.In a further communication dated  April , the Trade Union International of Workers in the Metal Industries states that several leaders of its affiliate, the National Union of Metallurgical and Allied Workers (UNTMRA), have been arrested on account of their trade union activities.
.The National Workers' Convention of Uruguay (CNT), in a communication dated  March , refers to a number of arbitrary acts carried out by the military rgime, including the dissolution by decree of the Convention, forcible entry into the premises of many trade unions, the issue of warrants for the arrest of all the leaders of the Convention, the prohibition of the check-off of trade union dues, dismissal of workers on account of trade union activities and imprisonment of anyone collecting union dues. In a communication dated  March , the CNT alleges generally that freedom of association and human rights are being completely ignored in Uruguay. In a further communication dated  March, the CNT refers to the forcible entry into the premises of the National Union of Metallurgical and Allied Workers, the Union of Woolworkers and the Sea Transport Workers' Federation in March  and the arrests which accompanied these actions. The complainants add that these three unions were involved in strictly trade union matters. Intervention by the police and armed forces in trade union affairs, state the complainants, has been a frequent occurrence since the coup d'tat of June . In many cases, trade union property has been damaged, stolen or confiscated. The CNT further alleges, in a communication dated  March , that on  March the premises of the Textile Workers' Union were broken into. In addition, state the complainants, all trade union programmes on the country's radio stations have been banned.
.In a communication dated may , the Workers' Organisation of the Omnibus allege that Antonio Tamayo, after his release from prison in December , resumed his trade union activities with the Transport Workers' Organisation and as workers' delegate-general to the Productivity, Prices and Incomes Commission, a tripartite organisation. The complainants state that, after a brief period of activity, Tamayo, along with forty-eight trade union and social militants, was dismissed by the ""Compaia Uruguaya de Transporte Colectivo SA (CUTCSA)"".
.The Medical Association of Uruguay, in a communication dated  May , alleges that Doctor Barret Diaz, General Secretary of the Association, has been detained since  May for no reason and without being brought to trial.
.In communications dated  June and  July , the International Federation of Actors allege that their Vice-President, and Secretary of the Uruguayan Actors' Union, Eduardo Prous, has been arrested. In a later communication, of  July , the complainants state that Mr. Prous has been released, although it is not yet known whether he would be able to pursue his activities in Uruguay.
.In communications dated  July and  August , the National Workers' Convention stresses that trade union activity has been totally suppressed and refers to the plight of detained trade unionists who are subjected to torture. In particular, the complainants state that, in a recent written communication, the Chief of Police notified the Union of Bank Employees (AEBU) that if it continued to pursue its activities and make claims, its headquarters would be closed. In another communication, dated  August , the CNT points out that, in August, four trade union",-1,1973,Uruguay
157,"leaders of the dockers' union disappeared, viz. Juan Gmez, Rubn Bello, Agustin Tapia and Humberto de los Santos, and no information as to their situation is available.
.The Government, in a communication dated  June , transmits copies of communications between the Commissariat of Police, the National Director of Information and Intelligence and the Director-General for Executive Co-ordination, in which the following nine persons are stated as having been detained in the ""Cilindro Municipal"" and subsequently released: Victor Brindisi, Hctor Goi, Miguel Bouzas, Victor Cayota, Carlos Espinosa, Alberto Fernndez, Sonia Guarnieri, Jos Luis Cola Horne and Romula Oraison. One of the above persons, Sonia Guarnieri, is said to have been detained on  October , released on  November  and detained again on  February . She is stated to be still in custody. In addition, three other persons (viz. Ricardo Vilaro, A. Rubio and Hctor Rodriguez) are stated to have been taken to the Central Prison by order of the Military Judge. The persons named above are said to have been detained under the emergency security measures in their capacity as members of the National Workers' Convention, which was dissolved for having engaged in activities contrary to the national interest. The names are given of seven other trade union leaders (viz. Antonio Tamayo, Felix Diaz, Roberto Olmos, Hctor Betancourt, Honorio Lindner, Aparicio Guzman and Rubn Villaverde), who were temporarily detained for the same reasons, but who have all been released. The trade union leader, Hctor P. Rodriguez, along with two professors, is said to have been tried by the military authorities on charges of seditious activities, as a result of the investigations carried out in connection with the explosion of a bomb in the Faculty of Engineering.
.Having examined all the information transmitted to it, the Committee expresses its concern at the numerous and grave accusations of infringements of trade union rights made against the Government, and its regret that the Government has supplied no reply to many of the allegations made. The Committee has in the past emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments, for their part, should realise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.With regard to the arrest and detention of trade unionists, the Committee would again draw the attention of the Government to the principles to which it referred when it examined this case in February , viz. that of a prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions or activities. Whenever the Committee has come to the conclusion, in the light of the information available, that the accused have been fairly tried by a proper court, have had the benefit of a regular judicial procedure and have been condemned for acts having nothing to do with ordinary trade union activities, it has ruled that the case did not call for further consideration. It has, however, emphasised that the question as to whether such a matter is one relating to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned, but that it is for the Committee itself to decide on the point after an examination of all available evidence, especially the text of the judicial proceedings.
.The Committee would also point out, as it has done on previous occasions in the past, that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.In addition to pointing out the above principles, which are applicable to the new allegations made against the Government since the Committee last examined the case, as well as to the allegations originally made by the complainants, the Committee is of the opinion that the allegations at its disposal bring into question the Government's observance of the main principles of the freedom of association Conventions which have been ratified by Uruguay. In particular, the new information made available to the Committee by the complainants, besides containing numerous and specific instances of arrest and detention of trade unionists, contains allegations of infringement of the right to hold trade union meetings, occupation of trade union premises (the Wool Workers' Federation, the National Union of Metal and Allied Workers, the Textile Workers' Union and the Sea Transport Workers' Federation), and dismissal of trade unionists on account of their trade union activities.
.The Committee, in view of the extent and gravity of the allegations made, recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to transmit, at an early date, full information on all the outstanding matters specified in the allegations formulated by the complainants, in particular concerning the arrest and detention of the named trade union leaders, indicating the precise reasons for their arrest and whether or not they have been brought to trial, as well as on the allegations of interference in trade union matters (right to hold trade union meetings, the forcible occupation of trade union premises, the alleged ban on the activities of the Glass Workers' Federation and the National Union of Workers of the Building and Allied Trades and on the measures taken against several teachers' organisations).
.In all these circumstances and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern at the extent and gravity of the allegations made and its regret that the Government has failed to supply sufficient information on many of the allegations made to enable the Committee to reach conclusions on the matters at issue in full knowledge of the facts;(b) to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part should realise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(c) in connection with the arrest and detention of trade unionists, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles contained in paragraphs  and  above, and to request it to supply full information concerning the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, stating in particular the precise reasons for their arrest, whether proceedings have been instituted against these trade unionists and, if so, to indicate the results thereof;(d) to request the Government to transmit, at an early date, as full and precise information as possible concerning all the matters specified in the allegations formulated by the complainants (including the allegations of interference in trade union matters, right of assembly, forcible occupation of trade union premises, the ban on the activities of the Glass Workers' Federation and the National Union of Workers in the Building and Allied Trades and the measures taken against several teachers' organisations);(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report to the Governing Body when it has received the information requested from the Government.
.The Committee considered this e previously at it. - session in November , when it submitted an interim report on it to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ).
.In paragraph  of this report, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to forward its comments as soon as possible on the various allegations made against it.
.The comments of the Government were forwarded in three communications. The first was received on  November  and the other two are dated  and  January , respectively.
.In support of its complaint, the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers submitted further informatics in a communication dated  October . The World Federation of Teachers' Unions sent a fresh communication on  November  and the World Confederation of Labour did the same on the th of that month. The Latin American Federation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries made its complaint in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It should be recalled that the allegations dealt on the one hand with the arrest of trade union leaders and on the other with the dissolution, by decree, of the National",-1,1973,Uruguay
158,"Workers' Convention.
.As regards the first set of allegations, the complainant organisations stated that numerous arrests had taken place and gave the names of some of the persons detained, and in particular: Antonio Tamayo, a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention and a representative of the Uruguayan workers at the International Labour Conference (th Session), arrested on his return from the Conference; Flix Diaz, another leading figure in the Convention; Mario Acosta, General Secretary of the Building Workers' Federation and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of Workers in the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries; Daniel Baldassari, General Secretary of the Petroleum Workers' Federation and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of chemical, oil and Allied Workers; Dr. Manuel Liberoff, Treasurer of the Medical Association of Uruguay, and five other leading figures in the Union: Juan J. Ormaechea, Nestor Figari, Alberto Cassamayou, Sergio Assandri and Carlos Buscato; and Victor Brindisi, General Secretary of the Teachers' Federation, a regional delegate of the Confederation of Latin-American Teachers and a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention.
.The World Federation of Trade Unions alleged further that sixty trade union leaders were being sought by the police, including Jose d'Elia, President, and Vladimir Turiansky, Vice-President of the National Workers' Convention, and Enrique Pastorino, President of the WFTU. In all some , workers have been arrested and threatened with trial by military courts, according to the WFTU. The latter also provided a list of  arrested trade union leaders, and the WCL sent a list (which it describes as incomplete) of  persons arrested.
.The WFTU, the WCL and the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries further complained that the National Workers' Convention had been dissolved by decree. The decree in question, which was issued on  June , gave as the reason for dissolution the attitude of the leaders of the Convention, who were said to have encouraged and defended the use of violence and urged workers to occupy their workplaces thereby obstructing public services and supplies.
.When the Committee considered the case at its session in November , it recommended that the Governing Body, without expressing a view as to the substance of the matter, should express its concern at these allegations and remind the Government that the Committee had always emphasised the importance which it attached to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists were charged with political or criminal offences which the government considered had no relation to their trade union functions, and the importance which it attached to the generally accepted principle (set out in Convention No. , ratified by Uruguay) that workers' organisations should not be subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority.
.In its communication dated  October , the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers stated that on  June  the Uruguayan authorities, with support from the armed forces, brutally broke up a strike by the oil workers, members of an affiliated trade union organisation, and placed the ANCAP refinery under military control. The headquarters of the trade union concerned had been closed and its meeting outlawed. Furthermore, the President of that union, Jonds Stneri, had been arrested and a warrant had been issued for the arrests of Daniel Baldassari, General Secretary, and of the Secretary-Treasurer. Moreover, the other Uruguayan affiliated organisation - the Glass Workers' Federation - had allegedly been prevented from exercising its normal activities.
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions, in a communication dated  November , asserts that the Uruguayan Government is continuing its repression of unionised teachers. The premises of teachers' unions have been broken into, typewriters and mimeograph machines destroyed and documents and records confiscated. It also claims that Victor Cayota, President of the Secondary School Teachers' Federation, has been imprisoned.
.In a communication dated  November , the World Confederation of Labour provides a list (stated to be incomplete) of trade union leaders in custody for nearly five months. Apart from certain leaders already referred to, the following were being held in the Army Ordnance and Services College: Roberto Olmos, General Secretary, Trade Union of Graphic Arts; Hctor Betancourt, a leading figure in the Transport Federation; Honorio Libner, a leader of the National Workers' Convention and Chairman of the National Federation of Municipal Employees; Aparcicio Guzmn, a leader of the Trade Union of Graphic Arts; and Rubn Villaverde, a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention and the Federation of State Water and Sewerage Workers. The complainants also alleged that many workers were still locked up in barracks, the Montevideo police headquarters and the ""Cilindro Municipal"" Sports Stadium; some of their names are given. None of these persons had been sentenced or even brought to trial. Their only offence was to have defended the Constitution and freedom of association. The complainants concluded by asking the ILO to secure the immediate release of the trade union leaders and workers who were kept in gaol ""so as to stifle the free and democratic trade union movement"".
.In a communication dated  December , the Latin American Federation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries claimed that its affiliate in Uruguay, the Sole Union of Building and Allied Trades Workers, had had its headquarters forcibly occupied by troops, its funds confiscated and its meetings prohibited.
.In a communication received by the ILO, on  November , the Government of Uruguay explained why it had arrested trade union leaders and dissolved the National Workers' Convention; in support of its comments, it enclosed an order approved by the Government on  June .
.The Government begins by declaring that it has for some considerable time been making every effort to devise a solution for the country's problems which, while offering the advantages of equity, would be in the best interests of the workers themselves. To this end it has held numerous direct talks with the various branches of the labour force, patiently encouraged constructive discussions among all Uruguayan organisations of employers and workers, proposed the creation of joint advisory Committees and suggested improvements in wages and working conditions. Many trade union organisations, and the vast majority of Uruguayan workers, have been very favourably impressed by these activities and the motives behind them.
.However, the Government continues, the National Workers' Convention, led by totalitarian extremists from minority groups, has opposed the Government's policy. It has refused recognition of the right to work, championed violence, promoted the unlawful occupation of workplaces, both public and private, called for sabotage, encouraged continuous and very serious street disturbances, done its best to stop the flow of supplies to the people and tried to paralyse public services - indeed, work of any kind anywhere. It has been a matter, in the Government's view, not of a strike, but of the activities of certain fanatically anti-democratic minority groups which had pushed the National Workers' Convention into the action described as a means of producing social chaos and a change in the political, economic and social life of the nation. The violent opposition of the Convention to the authorities was not, according to the Government, due to trade union motives; it was obviously political, the prime aim being to destroy current institutions.
.The Government states that recourse to violence cannot be admitted in any organised society and must be rejected absolutely. In this connection it notes that section () of the Uruguayan Constitution lays down the suspension of civic rights for participation in political or social organisations which attempt to destroy the foundations of the national community either by violence or by propaganda advocating violence.
.The Government recalls further that section  of the Uruguayan Constitution entitles persons to associate for any purpose provided the association is not unlawful. Among the forms of unlawful association defined by Act No.  of  July  is that which advocates violence against the institutions of the Republic or against the civil authorities. Section  of the Act provides that such associations shall be dissolved and that their leaders and members participating in such activities shall be charged under the criminal law.
.These provisions, the Government adds, clearly show that the National Workers' Convention has become an unlawful association in the above sense. Its activities could, under the Criminal Code, constitute rebellion, riotous assembly, public incitement to break the law and commit criminal acts, promotion of class hatred and contempt of the public authorities. It is for the criminal courts to define the offences and the criminal responsibility of the members and officers of the organisation.
.The Government's conduct in the present case has, it states, been justified in that under the Constitution it is responsible for keeping the peace and for taking prompt and vigorous action in the event of grave and unforeseen disturbance (section ,  and ). Moreover, section  of Act No.  of  July  empowers the Government to suspend meetings or activities in all premises, public or private, when such meetings or",0,1973,Uruguay
159,"activities cause, or might cause, a breach of the peace. With a view to the maintenance of order the Government has had to take the necessary measures for guaranteeing social peace and in particular to order the dissolution of the National Workers' Convention and the arrest and trial of its leaders by the competent criminal court.
.The Government, moreover, takes the view that the allegations of infringement of Conventions Nos.  and  cannot be sustained. While Convention No.  does require the authorities to ""refrain from any interference which would restrict"" the rights of organisations or hamper the legitimate exercise of those rights, it does, on the other hand, lay down that ""in exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their organisations shall respect the law of the land"". The National Workers' Convention, however, has taken the view that its independence and freedom of action are such that it can with impunity overlook the law of the land and even attempt to overturn or destroy it. It has ignored that defence of occupational interests for which trade unions exist in order to uphold certain political interests.
.Certainly, the Government continues, in any democratic society it is almost inevitable that the trade union movement shall be influenced by political parties. But it is essential to avoid a state of affairs in which the movement is used as a tool by some ideology or political faction and takes decisions which do not reflect the will of those who have freely come together in the defence of their interests.
.The observations made in respect of the National Workers' Convention, the Government considers, apply also to the complaints from the Medical Association of Uruguay and the Trade Unions international of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers (concerning the state body ANCAP). Lastly, it affirms that it continues to observe the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and .
.The Governmental Order dated  June , attached to the Government's letter to the ILO, declares the National Workers' Convention to be an unlawful association and decrees its dissolution. The order also decrees the closing of its premises, the attachment of its property, the freezing of all bank deposits in its name or that of any of its officers, and the arrest of these officers. Lastly, officers and members who may have carried out unlawful acts are to be tried by the competent criminal court.
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that the imprisonment of Antonio Tamayo and the searches carried out for Enrique Pastorino are in no way related to their holding of union office. The Government says that the arrest of Antonio Tamayo was ordered by the executive authority pursuant to the declaration of a state of emergency (section () of the Constitution), and that it is because he is presumed to have engaged in subversive activities harmful to the security of the State that Enrique Pastorino is being sought. In a more recent communication, dated  January , the Government states that Mr. Tamayo was set free at the end of December .
.The Committee takes note of the Governments observations, and in particular of the fact that Antonio Tamayo has been set free. As regards the arrest of the other trade union leaders, the Committee notes that according to the Government they will be tried by an appropriate criminal court. It observes, however, that the Government does not indicate in its comments the present position regarding the detained persons or whether they have been brought to trial. As far as Enrique Pastorino is concerned, the Government does not provide details on the nature of the acts of which he is accused.
.In such cases, the Committee has always emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the government considers have no relation to their trade union functions or activities. Whenever the Committee has come to the conclusion, in the light of the information available, that the accused have been fairly tried by a proper court, have had the benefit of a regular judicial procedure and have been condemned for acts having nothing to do with ordinary trade union activities, it has ruled that the case did not call for further consideration. It has, however, emphasised that the question whether such a matter relates to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned, but that it is for the Committee itself to decide on the point after an examination of all available evidence, especially the text of the judicial proceedings.
.As regards the dissolution, by decree, of the National Workers' Convention, the Committee once more emphasises the importance it attaches to the principle set forth in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), - ratified by Uruguay - according to which workers' organisations may not be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority. As the Committee has pointed out in other cases, dissolution by the Executive in virtue of a law conferring full powers or in the exercise of legislative functions, like dissolution by administrative authority, does not ensure the right of defence which normal judicial procedure alone can guarantee and which the Committee considers to be essential.
.The Committee has also taken note of the allegations concerning the ban on the activities of the Glass Workers' Federation and the Sole Union of Building and Allied Trades Workers, as well as the measures taken against several teachers' organisations. It has not yet received any comments from the Government with regard to these allegations.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with reference to the alleged arrest of trade union leaders(i) to take note of the Government's statement that Antonio Tamayo was set free in December ;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above and especially to the principle that whenever trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions or activities, they should be given a prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal;(iii) to request the Government to state whether proceedings have been instituted against all these trade unionists and, if so, the nature of the court dealing with the case and the stage the proceedings have reached and to supply copies of the judgements, once they are rendered, with the grounds adduced therefor;(b) as regards the alleged dissolution by decree of the National Workers' Convention to draw the attention of the Government to the importance it attaches to the principle that workers' organisations should not be subject to dissolution by administrative authority, and that likewise dissolution by the executive branch of the Government does not ensure the right of defence which normal judicial procedure alone can guarantee;(c) to request the Government to furnish its observations on the alleged ban on activities by the Glass Workers' Federation and the Sole Union of Building and Allied Trades Workers and on the measures taken against several teachers' organisations;(d) to request the Government to be good enough to send precise information on the nature of the acts of which Enrique Pastorino is accused;(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report to the Governing Body as soon as it receives the information requested from the Government.
.The complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants are contained in five communications dated  July,  July,  July,  July and  September  from the World Federation of Trade Unions; two communications from the world Confederation of Labour dated  July and  September ; one communication from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries dated  August ; one communication from the Trade Unions International of Chemical, oil and Allied Workers dated  September ; two communications from the Medical Association of Uruguay addressed on  July  to the United Nations and transmitted by the latter to the ILO; this complaint is supported by the World Medical Association in two communications of  and  August . The World Federation of Teachers' Unions sent its complaint in a communication dated  October .
.In view of the allegations formulated by the World Federation of Trade Unions in its first two communications the complaint was transmitted in two letters and one telegram indicating that this was a case considered urgent in accordance with the procedure in force. All the other complaints were submitted to the Government as they were received so that the Government might send its observations as rapidly as possible.
.No reply has been received from the Government to date.
.Uruguay has",0,1973,Uruguay
160,"ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances and for the case as a whole the Committee recommends to the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern at the allegations in the various complaints, with respect to which it regrets not having received the Government's reply in spite of a considerable lapse of time;(b) to request the Government to be kind enough to send its comments on the various allegations made against it as quickly as possible;(c) without coming to a decision on the substance of the allegations at the present time, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set out in paragraphs ,  and  above and in particular(i) to the importance which it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions;(ii) to the importance which it attaches to the principle consecrated explicitly in Article  of Convention No. , which Uruguay has ratified, according to which employers' and workers' organisations should not be subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a new report to the Governing Body when it has received the information requested from the Government.",0,1973,Uruguay
161,".The complaint of the National Convention of Workers of Uruguay was contained in a telegram received on  October . This complaint was transmitted to the Government, which submitted its observations on the subject in a communication dated  November .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that the National Convention of Workers of Uruguay had invited two Hungarian trade union leaders to visit their country. These two leaders had consequently requested visas from the Embassy of Uruguay in Budapest, but more than a month later the request had not been granted. The complainants considered that this attitude constituted an infringement of elementary trade union rights.
.In its observations the Government categorically denies the facts alleged by the complainants. On the basis of information supplied by the Chancellery it maintains that the visas requested had been granted in good time and that the administrative formalities referring to the granting of such visas had been carried out within the normal time limits.
.In the light of information available to the Committee it would appear that the visas requested by the Hungarian trade union leaders, invited by the complainants to visit Uruguay, were finally granted even if delays might have occurred at the outset.
.In these circumstances, and without expressing an opinion on the substance of the matter, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, since the question raised in the case has been resolved in a manner corresponding to the wish of the complainants, to decide that no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of the case.",0,1972,Uruguay
162,".The complaint of the Latin American Central of Workers is contained in a communication dated  June . This complaint was supported by the World Confederation of Labour in a communication, dated  August .
.The Government submitted its observations on the complaint in a communication dated  March .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state that they were informed by their national member organisation of Uruguay that on  May  one of their best active trade unionists, Mr. Luis Batalla, who worked in the construction industry, died as a result of torture inflicted upon him in a barracks situated in the interior of the country. According to the complainants, the post mortem revealed that his liver had been ruptured, that he had cuts on the head and the heels and numerous bruises over his entire body caused by the ill-treatment he had received.
.The observations of the Government on this complaint are very detailed and are summarised as follows: Mr. Luis Carlos Batalla had been detained on  May  on account of his membership of a subversive organisation self-styled the National Liberation Movement (Tupamaros). The investigation revealed that he had been recruited for this organisation approximately a year previously. After carrying out information tasks of relative significance, he acquired greater importance within this subversive movement acting as a recruiter and head of a group. On  April  he went under cover and joined a camp of this organisation. There, and subsequently in the city of Treinta y Tres, he plotted the death of an officer of the armed forces and a police officer as well as the capture of a radio transmitter in order to explain the causes of this act.
.On  May  his capture was requested through the intervention of the police and, between that date and  May, when he was arrested, he remained in hiding in various places. His death occurred on  May  in a military unit of the department of Treinta y Tres. Mr. Batalla had fainted after having been taken out of the place where he had been interrogated and had hit the edge of a flowerbed. The head of the Health Service of the military unit concerned diagnosed ""death through a possible cardio-vascular or cerebral attack"" since he did not present any external signs that might indicate another cause. That same night measures were taken to call in the military investigating judge, who ordered a post mortem. This was carried out on  May, the findings being ""death through acute anaemia caused by a rupture of the liver"". According to the doctor it was necessary to take into account the blow sustained when he fell in a faint and the state of obvious weakness due to malnutrition and fatigue as a result of his being a fugitive.
.The chief of the military region concerned immediately went to Montevideo to see the Minister of National Defence. As a result of this interview it was decided that he should personally carry out an exhaustive investigation into the facts and immediately remove the commanders and officers who were presumed to be involved in the case.
.According to information received from the military investigating judge inquiries were being continued in order to clarify the facts in accordance with the preliminary procedure.
.The Government in its communication stated that the fact that had led to the complaint in question was part of the picture of grave terrorist subversion against which the forces required under the Constitution and the laws to defend national legal order had been called upon to struggle undauntedly. It was not a question of fighting a delinquency accustomed to committing criminal offences by ordinary means, or openly opposing public authority. It was a question of dealing with one of the most perfected forms of terrorism, perhaps even the most perfected in the world and, without a doubt, the most dangerous and intolerant. During the struggle hundreds of suspects had passed through the investigating courts, the numbers of investigations, searches, interrogations, etc., growing till truly unusual figures had been reached. All this had required, it should be recalled, laborious, self-sacrificing and risky work and the keeping of hours which usually left no time for the minimum of rest.
.The Government concludes by saying that, in addition to carrying out the administrative and judicial investigations, Parliament exercised the control functions that are proper to it. The Minister of National Defence was required to explain to the Chamber of Representatives the circumstances of the death of Mr. Batalla and after the information had been given the Chamber approved the following motion: ""The Chamber of Representatives expresses its confidence that the armed forces of the Republic , in accordance with their unchanging historic tradition, will comply with the Constitutional and legal standards which lay down in all circumstances respect for the dignity of the human person. And in the face of the lamentable facts which led to the question raised in the Chamber, facts that make it clear that a citizen died through the ill-treatment received during his detention, it demands utmost speed in the proceedings and the public disclosure of those guilty and the penalties imposed upon them.""
.The Committee takes note of this information and cannot but deplore the circumstances surrounding the death of Luis Carlos Batalla as narrated in the statement made by the Government. The Committee has repeatedly pointed out that it should be the policy of every government to ensure observance of the rights of man, and especially, of the right of all detained or accused persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The safeguards of normal judicial procedure should not only be embodied in the law, but also applied in practice. Similarly, the Committee has always emphasised the importance it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences. With respect to allegations of ill-treatment, the Committee has pointed out the importance it attaches to the right of trade unionists, as of all other persons, to enjoy the guarantees afforded by due process of law in accordance with the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
.In any case the Committee considers that in the present case it has received from the Government information which shows sufficiently precisely that the measures taken had no connection with the exercise of trade union activities but were the result of activities carried out by Mr. Luis Carlos Batalla and unconnected with trade unions.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the detailed information supplied by the Government and to deplore the circumstances surrounding the death of Luis Carlos Batalla as narrated in the information concerned;(b) to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principles set out in paragraph ; and(c) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraph , that this case does not require further examination.",0,1972,Uruguay
163,".The joint complaint of the Confederation of State Officials' Organisations and the National Federation of Municipal Workers and Employees is contained in a communication dated  March  addressed direct to the ILO. By a communication dated  April  the complainants through the National Convention of Workers of Uruguay submitted additional information in support of their complaint. The text of these communications was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations thereon in a communication dated  August .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants' protest is essentially against the reintroduction of Decree No.  of  June , which lays down economic sanctions, along with the obligation to work, in the case of strikes or stoppages by civil servants. In the opinion of the complainants, this text is contrary to the Constitutional guarantees, which include the right to strike.
.In its comments the Government states that in Uruguay the principle that strikes by civil servants are illegal is derived from article , paragraph , of the Constitution and that Decree No.  of  June  is based on the said principle. The Government continues to state: ""Nevertheless, while strikes are illegal, machinery exists to permit civil servants to enjoy the most extensive rights of association, submit their claims, and obtain adequate and proper satisfaction by means expressly provided for by law (Act No.  dated  December , sections  and )."" The Government points out in conclusion that, ""in addition, it has taken the initiative on a number of occasions not to enforce the financial sanctions provided for in the above Decree"".
.The Committee has already had before it a case involving Uruguay which referred to a similar situation and where reference was made to Act No.  of , mentioned by the Government in the present case.
.On that occasion, in view of the statement by the Government that strikes in the civil service are not permitted, the Committee, considering that the allegations concerning the right to strike fall within its competence, although only to the extent to which they affect trade union rights, considered it necessary to recall that, while restrictions on strikes in the civil service or in essential services could be accepted, there should in this case be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who were thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, which implied that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned could participate at all stages.
.As for the means by which workers deprived of the right to strike could obtain a settlement of their claims, the Committee noted - as is also the case in the present complaint - that the information supplied by the Government refers solely to sections  and  of Act No.  instituting conciliation procedures.
.In the circumstances the Committee can only reach the same conclusion as that which it reached following its examination of the previous case referred to above, by recommending the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that where strikes are forbidden in the civil service or in essential services such prohibition should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.",0,1972,Uruguay
164,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  August  addressed to the ILO by the Trade Unions International of Transport, Port and Fishery Workers (a Professional Department of the World Federation of Trade Unions), to which the complaining organisation appends a document emanating from the Single Sea Transport Workers' Union of Uruguay (Sindicato Unico del Transporte Martimo del Uruguay), an affiliate of the International. The text of this communication and its annex were transmitted to the Government for comment, and the latter forwarded its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee takes note of these observations.
.It emerges from a perusal of Decree No.  of  July  that its purpose was to approve regulations concerning the drawing up and keeping of registers of merchant marine personnel. Under these regulations the supervision of the registers for captains and officers on the one hand, and seamen on the other, is entrusted to two "" administrative committees "" composed of the Director of the Merchant Marine, as chairman, and representatives of the shipowners and personnel concerned (in the case of the latter, representatives of occupational organisations possessing legal personality). The essential purpose of the registers appears to be to act as a placement service. Any member of an "" administrative committee "" may challenge, giving his reasons, the inclusion of any person on the list of those available for work, and the challenge will be examined by a tripartite board whose ruling is final. If for any reason no more registered personnel should be available, the Director may authorise the engagement of personnel not on the register who fulfil the statutory requirements.
.In these circumstances the only allegation which could have any bearing on the exercise of trade union rights is that referring to the conditions of appointment of the trade union representatives on the "" administrative committees "". It is to be noted that in this case all workers' organisations possessing legal personality are entitled to appoint a representative. Consequently there is no question of one organisation being appointed to represent all the workers in the branch of employment in question, which would have made it necessary, from the standpoint of trade union rights, to assess, on the basis of objective and impartial criteria, the relative representativeness of the organisations concerned. The only requirement laid down in the regulations is that the organisations represented should possess legal personality. Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Uruguay, stipulates that the acquisition of legal personality by workers' and employers' organisations shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the rights and guarantees provided for in Articles ,  and  of the Convention. In the present instance, the national organisation directly concerned merely claims that such a requirement "" should not be laid down "" without supplying any evidence to prove that the acquisition of legal personality is made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the exercise of any of the rights and guarantees generally recognised in relation to freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, the Committee considers that the complainants have not furnished proof that the facts stated in their allegations constitute an infringement of freedom of association, and recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.Geneva,  November .(Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1969,Uruguay
165,".The Committee last examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body, which appeared in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).
.Certain questions, however, remain outstanding, notably those concerning the present position of the State Electricity and Telephone Service (UTE) and, in particular, the closing of its premises and the nature of the breaches of discipline which prompted the dismissal of members of the Management Committee of the UTE Employees' Union (AUTE). On these points the Government was requested to supply further information.
.The Government submitted its further observations on the case in a communication dated  August .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee submitted the following recommendations, which were approved by the Governing Body and transmitted to the Government
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the detention of various trade unionists, to note the information supplied by the Government in its communications of  March  and  March , according to which all those persons mentioned in the allegations as having been detained have either been released or else were not imprisoned in the first place, and also to note that at present no one is being held under the Emergency Security Measures Decree;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the closing of the premises of the National Labour Congress (CNT) to ask the Government to supply information concerning the present position regarding the CNT and, in particular, to state whether its premises still remain closed and, if so, for what reason;(c) as regards the allegations concerning the taking of anti-union measures against the AUTE:(i) to note the Government's statement contained in its communication of  March , according to which the state of normality in labour and trade union matters in the AUTE implies the right of the trade union(s) to carry out under normal conditions all lawful and legitimate activities, including that of negotiating with the management;(ii) to ask the Government, once again, to supply detailed information on the nature of the breaches of discipline which prompted the dismissal of members of the Management Committee of the AUTE;(d) to take note of this interim report on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the further information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (b) and (e) (ii) above.
.With regard to the Committee's first question, the Government, in its communication of  August , states that the premises of the CNT have not been closed, that this organisation is not the object of any police or other measures which would prevent it from functioning normally and that, in consequence, it is carrying on all its activities with complete freedom. With regard to the second question, the Government denies the allegations according to which officials of the UTE had been dismissed for exercising trade union activities or for belonging to the AUTE. According to the Government, the dismissals in question were decided on  July  by a resolution of the UTE administration and as a result of the fact that a number of officials had illegally abandoned their work.
.The Government encloses in its communication of  August  a copy of the above-mentioned resolution as well as the text of section  of the Staff Regulations of UTE Employees, drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of Uruguay.
.By this resolution some fifty-six officials were dismissed; their names and functions are specified in the text. The resolution also sets forth the considerations which prompted the decision in question. These considerations may be summarised as follows: the strike led to a sudden disruption of the electricity supply, with the result that the lives of the inmates of hospitals and similar establishments were endangered; a public summons was issued on  June , in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Staff Regulations, calling for a return to work within twenty-four hours; this summons was not followed by the employees in question; section , which forbids strikes of UTE employees, provides that those employees who disregard the above-mentioned summons shall be dismissed; moreover, since the strike was held in contravention of the provisions contained in sections  and  of Act No.  of  December , it was clearly illegal; this situation of illegality was rendered more serious by reason of the fact that there was a deliberate disregard of the provisions of the Decree respecting the mobilisation of the personnel of the Administration (No. /) and the Emergency Security Measures Decree (No. / of  June ); in all these circumstances and in view of the obvious and compelling needs of the essential, public service managed by the UTE, it was necessary to dismiss the employees concerned in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Staff Regulations.
.The Committee notes that the Government justifies the action taken by the authorities on the grounds that the strike in question was unlawful and that the summons calling for a return to work was disregarded by the employees concerned. The Government bases its position essentially on section  of the UTE Staff Regulations, which contains an absolute prohibition on recourse to strike action by UTE officials and on sections  and  of Act No.  of  December . Under section  of this Act, a Committee on Productivity, Prices and Incomes is to, inter alia, act as conciliator in labour disputes submitted to it; and no strike or lockout is to be considered lawful if the matter in dispute and the decision to take such action have not been put before it at least seven days before the date fixed for the strike or lockout. According to section  of the Act, if the dispute takes place in a public service, the Committee may decide within five days of receiving such notice what essential services have to be maintained; any interruption of the services will render the strike or lockout unlawful.
.The Committee has always been guided by the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are within its competence so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights) In a number of cases, the Committee has observed that, while strikes in essential services may be prohibited, such prohibition is only acceptable where accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.
.In the present case, there is an absolute prohibition on recourse to strike action by the employees of an essential service. However, as regards any alternative means that the employees in question might have at their disposal for the settlement of their claims, the information supplied by the Government merely refers to certain provisions of Act No. , which provides for conciliation procedures.
.In all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement that the premises of the CNT have not been closed, that this organisation is not the object of any police or other measures which would prevent it from functioning normally and that, in consequence, it is carrying on all its activities with complete freedom;(b) to note that the dismissal of officers of the AUTE resulted from their participation in a strike in an essential service, where such action is prohibited by law;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that, where strikes are prohibited in essential services, such prohibition must be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in March  when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body which appeared in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.Certain questions, however, remain outstanding, notably those concerning the alleged imprisonment of trade unionists, the closing of trade union premises and the taking of anti-union measures against the State Electricity and Telephone Service Employees' Union (AUTE). On these points the Government was requested to supply further information.
.The Government submitted its further observations on the case in two communications dated  March and  March .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In paragraph  of its th Report the Committee submitted the following recommendations which were approved by the Governing Body and transmitted to the Government:
.In these circumstances, with respect to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the",0,1969,Uruguay
166,"military call-up and imprisonment of workers and trade union leaders in :(i) to take note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the decree of  November  brought to an end the military call-up of officials of the State Electricity and Telephone Service (UTE);(ii) to take note of the information submitted by the Government to the effect that, of a group of five trade unionists alleged to have been imprisoned, four had been set at liberty, and that the Government will supply the information relating to Mr. Humberto Rodriguez when this has been obtained;(iii) to ask the Government to be good enough to supply such information as soon as possible, and also information on the alleged imprisonment of various teachers' trade union leaders and the alleged closing of the premises of the AUTE and of the National Labour Congress (CNT), indicating in each case the precise reason for the measures taken;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to anti-union measures taken against an organisation:(i) to decide for the reasons indicated in paragraph  that the allegation relating to the collection of union dues does not call for further examination;(ii) to ask the Government to be good enough to communicate whether the state of normality in labour and trade union matters in the UTE, to which its observations referred, implies that the trade union is in a position to carry on all its normal activities, including the discussion of problems with the management and whether the punishment of dismissal alleged to have been inflicted on the members of the Management Committee and other leaders of the AUTE has been annulled, and-if these sanctions are being maintained-to supply more precise information on the nature of the breaches of discipline which occasioned the dismissals;(iii) to invite the Government to be good enough to state whether there remains any restrictions on the liberty of any of the persons referred to, and if so, the precise reasons therefor;(c) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the further information asked for from the Government.
.As a preface to the observations contained in its communication of  March , the Government points out that no trade union body representing the teaching profession has been prevented from carrying on its lawful activities; that no trade union premises have been closed, that no measures have been taken which violate International Labour Conventions on freedom of association, and that the only measures initiated have been taken on the basis of the Emergency Security Measures Decree.
.The Government states that public servants employed in essential services do not enjoy the right to strike and that, consequently, members of the teaching profession are excluded from this right. The Government adds, however, that no sanctions have been taken against any member of the teaching profession for taking part in strikes and that the legal basis for any measures which have been taken is the Emergency Security Measures Decree.
.The Government further states that all those persons mentioned in the complaint as having been detained have either been released or else were not imprisoned in the first place; that no one was detained for trade union activities but solely for having infringed the provisions of the Emergency Security Measures Decree of  June . Moreover, the Government points out that no one is at present being held under this decree.
.The Government explains that all these measures, which are subject to the control of the General Legislative Assembly, or during the recess, of its standing Committee, and which may be revoked at any time, were designed, together with other similar measures, to combat subversion at a time of crisis which it was fortunately able to overcome, and in which it had to face an offensive aimed at making chaos and violence prevail against the Constitutional and democratic rgime.
.The Government further states that the detention of the persons referred to above had nothing to do with the particular problems of either education or freedom of association.
.Replying to other questions raised by the Committee in its th Report, the Government in its communication of  March  states the following:(a) Mr. Humberto Rodriguez was arrested on  June  and released on  July ; the reason for his detention was, as in the other cases mentioned, violation of the provisions of the Emergency Security Measures Decree;(b) the premises of the CNT were closed on  June  but the organisation in question, which enjoys the right of assembly within the limits set by the decree of  June , has since held many meetings quite normally and has carried on intense trade union activity without, however, officially communicating its new address;(c) the return to normal of the labour and trade union situation in the UTE means that the trade union(s) has (have) the right to carry on all lawful and legitimate trade union activities, including that of negotiating with the management;(d) the penalties inflicted on certain officials of the UTE were for acts qualified as breaches of discipline under the Personnel Regulations. No measures taken were prompted by trade union activities. Moreover, none of these measures has been rescinded by the Administrative Disputes Tribunal, the independent legal body responsible under the Constitution for supervising the legality of administrative acts.
.In regard to this last point the Government also states that it is prepared to supply a list of cases of administrative appeals for revocation of decisions made by the UTE management on this subject, and a list of the actions for revocation, if any, which, once administrative channels have been exhausted, officials or ex-officials who think their rights have been infringed by administrative acts, either illegal or involving abuse of powers, can bring before the Administrative Disputes Tribunal.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government in its communications of  March  and  March , according to which all those persons mentioned in the allegations as having been detained have either been released or else were not imprisoned in the first place; it also notes that at present no one is being held under the Emergency Security Measures Decree.
.The Committee further notes the Government's statement contained in its communication of  March , according to which no teachers' trade union has been prevented from functioning normally, nor have the premises of any such trade union been closed. By contrast, the Government, in its communication of  March , states-without giving any kind of explanation therefor-that the premises of the CNT were closed on  June  but that the union has subsequently carried on intense trade union activity without, however, officially communicating its new address to the authorities.
.In this connection the Committee recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government to supply information concerning the present position regarding the CNT and, in particular, to state whether its premises still remain closed and, if so, for what reason.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement according to which the state of normality in labour and trade union matters in the UTE implies the right of the trade union(s) to carry out under normal conditions all lawful and legitimate activities, including that of negotiating with the management. The Committee observes, however, that, while the Government states that the sanctions taken against certain officials of the UTE were for ""breaches of discipline"" under the terms of the Personnel Regulations, that there exists an appeals procedure which may be invoked by any official who considers that he has been unjustly treated and that, to date, none of the sanctions inflicted has been rescinded by the Administrative Disputes Tribunal, the Government has still not replied to the Committee's earlier request for more precise information on the nature of the breaches of discipline which prompted the imposition of these sanctions.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government, once again, to supply detailed information on the nature of the breaches of discipline which prompted the taking of the sanctions in question.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the detention of various trade unionists, to note the information supplied by the Government in its communications of  March  and  March , according to which all those persons mentioned in the allegations as having been detained have either been released or else were not imprisoned in the first place, and also to note that at present no one is being held under the Emergency Security Measures Decree;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the closing of the premises of the National Labour Congress, to ask the Government to supply information concerning the present position regarding the CNT and, in particular, to state whether its premises still remain closed and, if so, for what reason;(c) as regards the allegations concerning the taking of anti-union measures against the AUTE:(i) to note the Government's statement contained in its communication of  March , according",1,1969,Uruguay
167,"to which the state of normality in labour and trade union matters in the UTE implies the right of the trade union(s) to carry out under normal conditions all lawful and legitimate activities, including that of negotiating with the management;(ii) to ask the Government, once again, to supply detailed information on the nature of the breaches of discipline which prompted the dismissal of members of the Management Committee of the AUTE;(d) to take note of this interim report on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the further information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (b) and (c) (ii) above.Geneva,  May .

.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body, which appears in paragraphs - of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.Certain aspects of the case are outstanding, which relate to allegations on the mobilisation of workers, the imprisonment of trade unionists and the closing of trade union premises, on which points further information was requested from the Government. The Committee also adjourned to its present meeting the examination of certain allegations on anti-trade-union measures against the UTE Employees' Union (AUTE).

.The complaints and the additional information submitted by the complainants are contained in two communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated  July and  August ; two communications from the UTE Employees' Union, dated  July and  August ; a communication from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, dated  August , a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), dated  August , and a communication from the World Federation of Teachers' Unions, dated  October .
.The texts of the above-mentioned communications were forwarded to the Government of Uruguay, each as it was received, and the Government submitted its observations in four communications, dated  August,  September,  and  October .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the questions referred to by the complainants in the present case appear to constitute, in essentials, the continuation or repetition in  of certain occurrences which were examined by the Committee in Case No. , concerning Uruguay. This case, as the Committee observed, basically involved a series of measures taken by the Uruguayan Government (in )-emergency security measures similar to a state of siege, the freezing of salaries and prices, and the mobilisation of workers-which applied to workers in various state agencies. According to the allegations made on this occasion, the measures taken by the Government were aimed at imposing a wage freeze, suppressing the claims put forward by the workers and impeding the exercise of the right to strike by mobilising the workers, while other measures, such as the banning of meetings, the dismissal and imprisonment of trade union officials and workers, etc., had been adopted.
.In connection with these matters, the Committee recalled, at its session in February , that in other cases in which complaints had been made of alleged infringements of freedom of association under a state of siege or emergency or by virtue of national security legislation, the Committee had stated that it was not called upon to comment on the necessity for or desirability of such legislation, which is a purely political consideration, but must consider what repercussions the legislation might have on trade union rights.
.The Committee also recalled that, on other occasions when it has had to examine complaints involving the mobilisation of workers, it has taken the view that such a measure is of an exceptional nature in view of the gravity of its consequences with regard to personal freedoms and trade union rights, and could be justified only by the need to ensure the functioning of essential services or industries whose interruption would lead to a situation of acute crisis.
.In addition, on this occasion, in view of the statement by the Government that strikes in the civil service are not permitted, the Committee, considering that the allegations concerning the right to strike fall within its competence, although only to the extent to which they affect trade union rights, considered it necessary to recall that, while restrictions on strikes in the civil service or in essential services could be accepted, there should in such cases be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who were thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, which implied that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned could participate at all stages.
.Furthermore, the Committee observed that the wage freeze ordered by the Government did not affect the public sector alone but also curtailed collective bargaining in the private sector of the economy. In this connection, the Committee recalled I that it had pointed out in one of its earlier cases that the development of procedures for voluntary negotiation constituted an important aspect of freedom of association, but that it would be difficult to lay down an absolute rule in this matter since, under certain circumstances, governments might feel that the position of their countries called at certain times for stabilisation measures, during the application of which it would not be possible for wage rates to be fixed freely through the medium of collective bargaining.
.At its sessions in February and May , the Committee examined the information submitted by the Government concerning the measures adopted in  and the subsequent occurrences and, in particular, the information concerning the reasons for the introduction of the emergency measures, the subsequent repeal of such measures, and the release of the trade unionists who had been arrested on this occasion. The Committee also received a statement in which the Government declared that it was strictly applying, and would continue to apply, the principles laid down by the Committee concerning the guarantees to be accorded to workers deprived of the right to strike, a subject dealt with by an Act promulgated in December , which is concerned with the conciliation procedures applicable to such workers. After having emphasised the",1,1969,Uruguay
168,"importance of the principles given in the preceding paragraphs  to , and having taken note that the emergency measures, including those concerning the mobilisation of civil servants introduced in , had been repealed, the Committee, at its session in May , recommended the Governing Body to decide that Case No.  did not call for a more thorough examination on its part.
.The allegations made in the present case refer essentially to a new decree on emergency security measures promulgated by the Uruguayan Government on  June . It is stated in one of the complaints that the reason for the new security measures was the disquiet of the workers when faced by the wage freeze and the dismissal of its leaders, and it is alleged in another that, by the repeated application of such measures, the Government intends to make them the normal method of solving labour conflicts. The Government, for its part, categorically denies these allegations and submits the text of the provisions in question, according to which the security measures were introduced after the calling of a general strike intended to include the civil service and essential services provided by state agencies and aimed at interrupting various services and disrupting public order. The Government states that the system of security measures will remain in force for such a period as may be necessary for normality to be achieved, but that the measures for the mobilisation of workers have already been rescinded in respect of the workers employed by various state agencies; such measures appear to be still in force with respect to the workers in the State Telephone Service (UTE) where, to judge from the complaints, the conflict between the trade union organisation concerned and the authorities appears to have been particularly serious. In fact, so far as this conflict is concerned, the Committee observes that the complaints are not restricted to the mobilisation measures introduced on  June , but also contain allegations concerning the systematic refusal of the administrative authorities to meet the trade union representatives in order to discuss the problems affecting the workers, concerning the dismissal of numerous trade union officials, and concerning the prevention of the collection of union dues and the appropriation of the dues for a particular month. The Committee proposes to examine at its next session the reply of the Government to the allegation submitted in this connection by the UTE Employees' Union.
.Certain general measures provided for in the decree on emergency security measures appear, then, to be still in force, namely the prohibition of all propaganda in favour of stoppages and strikes, and of meetings connected therewith, the premises in which it is intended to hold such meetings being liable to closure; furthermore, it is still legally possible to arrest or detain any person, and consequently any trade unionist, without previous trial. The Government emphasises that its fundamental objective is to ensure liberty for all, including the trade unions, and states that all the measures were taken with this end in view, recalling also that the National Assembly, which continues to function normally, can order their rescission. Furthermore, the application of these measures within the legal framework is said to be ensured by the judiciary, whose independence is stressed by the Government.
.The Committee takes note of these observations of the Government, and takes note likewise, in particular, of its declaration that it is willing to agree to any procedure and any acceptable method of establishing proof in order to clarify the questions mentioned in the complaints concerning the reasons for the arrest of trade unionists under the system of emergency security measures and the treatment of those arrested and mobilised, and concerning the application of such measures as far as the trade union organisations are concerned.
.The Government states explicitly that it has neither dissolved nor taken over any trade union organisation. It follows from its observations that, as far as such organisations are concerned, it has applied to them only the prohibition of meetings connected with stoppages and strikes, this being provided for in the decree on security measures, which empowers the authorities to close the premises in which it is intended to hold such meetings. In this connection, certain allegations to which the Government has not specifically replied refer to the closing down of the headquarters of the CNT (whose officials are said to have been obliged to operate under conditions of clandestinity) and of the UTE Employees' Union; in addition, according to the complainants, the channels of communication of the unions have been blocked. In view of the importance which the Committee and the Governing Body have always given to the principle that the right of trade unions to meet freely in their own premises without the need for any prior authorisation and without any form of control by the authorities constitutes a fundamental element of freedom of association, and to the principle that the right to express opinions through the press or in any other way is certainly one of the essential elements of the rights of trade unions, the Committee considers that, in order to pursue the examination of such allegations with full knowledge of the case and to determine the scope of the security measures as far as the exercise of these rights is concerned, it would be useful to receive more precise information from the Government concerning the matter.
.With reference to the particular cases of arrest mentioned by the complainants, the Government has submitted information concerning six trade unionists who have been released, and two who are said not to have been arrested. On the other hand, the Government does not refer specifically to the alleged arrest of the trade unionists Ariel Mederos, Hugo Castro, Ricardo Mario Acosta, Humberto Rodriguez and Eduardo Platero, and has not yet submitted its observations concerning the complaint of the World Federation of Teachers' Unions.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note that, in their essentials, the questions of principle concerning the introduction by the Government of emergency security measures has already been examined by the Committee in its th and th Reports, approved by the Governing Body, in connection with an earlier case concerning Uruguay (Case No. );(b) with regard to the allegations made in the present case with respect to the security measures promulgated by the Decree of  June , to take note of the statements of the Government according to which no official, worker or employee has been arrested as such, the arrests-within the Constitutional system of the emergency security measures-having been made on the grounds of activities contrary to public order, subversive acts or contraventions of the above-mentioned decree; no industrial or trade union organisation has been taken over; no person has been maltreated or tortured, and no form of forced labour has been imposed, the Government being willing to agree to any procedure and any acceptable method of establishing proof in order to elucidate these matters;(c) to take note of the statement of the Government according to which the mobilisation of workers in various state agencies has already been rescinded, and that it is hoped that demobilisation will soon affect all those workers covered by the decrees which have been promulgated;(d) in view of the serious consequences that the mobilisation of workers may have from the point of view of the exercise of trade union rights, and the fact that such measures can be justified only by the need to ensure the functioning of essential services or industries the interruption of which would give rise to a situation of acute crisis, to express the hope that the measures of this type still remaining in force may be repealed as soon as possible and to request the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken for this purpose;(e) to request the Government to be good enough to submit its observations relating specifically to the allegations concerning the closure of the premises of the CNT and the UTE Employees' Union;(f) to take note of the information submitted by the Government according to which six"" of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints, who had been arrested, have been released, and that no record of the arrest of two others can be found, but to request the Government to be good enough to submit its observations with regard to the other trade unionists mentioned in paragraph ;(g) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will present a further report once it has received the additional information and observations requested from the Government in subparagraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this paragraph.Geneva,  November .(Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1969,Uruguay
169,".This case has already been examined by the Committee at its session in February , at which an interim report was presented containing a detailed analysis of the allegations formulated, together with observations by the Government relating to these allegations. The recommendations submitted to the Governing Body by the Committee after consideration of this case at its session in February  are contained in paragraph  of its th Report, which reads as follows:Accordingly, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the fact that the mobilisation of employees of the National Fuel, Alcohol and Portland Cement Administration, the State Sanitation Service and the Telecommunications Administration has been terminated;(b) to take note of the Government's statement that the individuals arrested under the prompt measures of security were immediately released, that the occupation of various trade union premises was purely temporary and that the freedom of trade union organisations to conduct their own affairs is recognised;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to inform it more specifically of the present position of the union leaders Ramn Freire Pizzano and Otilio Barragn;(d) to draw the Government's attention to the principle set forth in paragraph  above concerning the mobilisation of workers and to request the Government to inform it of the present position in this respect of the employees of the State Telephone Services and the state-owned banks;(e) to draw the Government's attention similarly to the provision of safeguards for civil servants and employees of essential services who are deprived of the right to strike and the development of voluntary bargaining procedures, and to request it to be good enough to supply details of any developments which may have occurred in this respect;(f) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will present a further report to the Governing Body once it has received the additional information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) above..A communication was received from the Government dated  April  following the request for additional information formulated in the above-quoted paragraph.
.A communication was received from the Government dated  April  following the request for additional information formulated in the above-quoted paragraph.
.The Government, in its reply, indicates that Mr. Freire Pizzano, who was arrested under the prompt measures of security on  June , was released on  July of the same year. As regards Mr. Barragn, arrested in the same circumstances on  July , he was released on  August.
.The measures of security applied at that time, says the Government, were cancelled by virtue of a decree, dated  March , issued by the Executive Power, and at present mobilisation measures do not apply to civil servants.
.The Government concludes that it applies and will continue to apply the principles laid down in paragraph  of the th Report relating to safeguards to be presented to workers deprived of the right to strike, and in support of this statement it submits the text of an Act dated  December  relating to conciliation procedures applicable to the given categories of workers.
.In view of the above, having noted in the information supplied by the Government, on the one hand, that the union leaders, Mr. Freire Pizzano and Mr. Barragn have been released and, on the other, that all measures for the mobilisation of civil servants have been cancelled, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, dated  July , the World Confederation of Labour, dated  July , the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees, dated  August , and the World Federation of Trade Unions, dated  October . These communications were forwarded to the Uruguayan Government, which sent its observations on  November .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that this case involves basically a series of measures taken by the Uruguayan Government-prompt measures of security similar to a state of emergency, the freezing of wages and prices, and the mobilisation of workers-which particularly affected the public sector of the economy, since the workers who were called up were employed by various state agencies. These security measures, according to the complainants, were not justified and were designed solely to facilitate the imposition of a wage freeze. Using these powers, the Government had repressed the series of claims formulated by the workers who were striving to protect their wages at a time of acute inflation. This repression had, allegedly, led to serious infringements of trade union rights in that the exercise of the right to strike had been impeded by the mobilisation of the workers concerned, meetings had been forbidden, trade union officials had been dismissed and imprisoned, etc.
.In other cases dealt with by the Committee in which complaints had been made of alleged infringements of freedom of association under a state of siege or emergency or by virtue of national security legislation, the Committee, while indicating that it is not called upon to comment on the necessity for or desirability of such legislation, which is a purely political consideration, has always taken the view that it must consider what repercussions the legislation might have on trade union rights.
.In the present case, the legislation in question led firstly to the mobilisation of employees of banks and other state agencies such as the Telecommunications, Sanitation and Fuel Administrations. On other occasions when the Committee has had to examine cases involving the mobilisation of workers, it has taken the view that such a measure is of an exceptional nature in a labour dispute in view of the gravity of its consequences with regard to personal freedoms and trade union rights and could only be justified by the need to ensure the working of essential services or industries whose suspension would lead to ail acute crisis. This is what appears to be the case from the text of the decree concerning the prompt measures of security, according to which not only had work been paralysed in the state banking system and in public administration in general, thereby preventing the normal working of various services which were essential to the administration of the country and the community, but there had also been a climate of violence and breaches of law and order.
.As regards the other measures by the Government to which the complainants refer-the arrest and dismissal of trade unionists and workers and the occupation of union premises-they appear to have been a direct result of the strikes which occurred after the emergency decree had been issued and the state employees mobilised. With regard more particularly to the arrest of trade unionists, the Committee takes note of the Government's general statement to the effect that all the individuals arrested under the emergency decree were immediately released. The Government specifically refers to Mr. Miguel Angel Olascoaga and Mr. Luis Alberto Iguini, leaders of the Confederation of Civil Servants' Organisations, both of whom were set free on  July . The Government makes no mention of Mr. Ramn Freire Pizzano or Mr. Otilio Barragn, both leaders of the CNT, who, according to the communication dated  October  from the World Federation of Trade Unions, were also arrested.
.With regard to the occupation of trade union premises by the police and the army-according to the complainants, the headquarters of the Uruguayan Federation of Commercial and Industrial Employees, the CNT and the Association of Bank Employees-the Committee notes the Government's statement that this occupation was only temporary and took place in accordance with the emergency decree. The Committee accordingly presumes that the premises were duly handed back to the respective trade union organisations.
.The Committee likewise notes that at the end of August  the mobilisation of employees of the ANCAP, the OSE and the Telecommunications Administration was terminated. It would appear, therefore, that this measure is still in force in the case of the UTE and the state-owned banks.
.As regards the suspension of the activities of the tripartite group set up to examine the question of wages and the anti-inflationary measures that should be taken-a step which occurred before the issue of the emergency decree, the mobilisation of the workers and the freezing of wages-the Committee notes that the Government makes no specific reference to this point in its reply. The Government merely states that inflation was nullifying the effect of the apparent advantages of higher wages, and that it therefore decided to impose a freeze on both wages and prices. However, the Government explains that this was a temporary measure and that subsequently increases were granted in both the public and the private sectors.
.The Committee considers that the establishment of the tripartite group was in accordance with the provision in",1,1968,Uruguay
170,"the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), to the effect that consultation and co-operation should be promoted between public authorities and employers' and workers' organisations with the general objective of achieving mutual understanding and good relations between them with a view to developing the economy as a whole or individual branches thereof, improving conditions of work and raising standards of living and, in particular, that the authorities should seek the views, advice and assistance of employers' and workers' organisations in an appropriate manner in respect of such matters as the preparation and implementation of laws and regulations affecting their interests. Furthermore, in view of the Government's statement that strikes are illegal in the civil service, the Committee, recalling that allegations concerning the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect trade union rights, considers it necessary to refer to another of its conclusions. The Committee has held that while restrictions on the right to strike in the public service or in essential services could be accepted, there should in such cases be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who are thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, which implies that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.
.The Committee observes that the wage freeze ordered by the Government did not only affect the public sector but also curtailed collective bargaining in the private sector of the economy. In this connection the Committee pointed out in one of its earlier cases that the development of procedures for the voluntary negotiation of agreements constituted an important aspect of freedom of association, but that it would be difficult to lay down an absolute rule concerning this matter because, under certain circumstances, governments might feel that the economic position of their countries called at certain times for stabilisation measures during the application of which it would not be possible for wage rates to be fixed freely through the medium of collective bargaining.
.In their allegations the complainants also refer to a Bill designed to abolish certain trade union rights and, more particularly, the right to bargain collectively. The Government states in its reply that legislation is due to enter into force to reorganise the system of fixing wages in the private sector and to replace the existing emergency methods by a permanent system, which would take account of the experience of Uruguay and other countries and also of the principles and standards of the ILO.
.Finally, the Committee takes note of the request by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labour in their communications dated  and  July  for the appointment of an ILO committee of inquiry to make an on-the-spot investigation of the allegations made in the complaints. In the light of the foregoing analysis of the allegations and of the Government's reply, and of the principles set forth, and bearing in mind that the measures taken by the authorities appear to have been temporary and to have already been rescinded as regards certain of the allegations, the Committee does not think it advisable at the present time to give further consideration to this request.
.Accordingly, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the fact that the mobilisation of employees of the National Fuel, Alcohol and Portland Cement Administration, the State Sanitation Service and the Telecommunications Administration has been terminated;(b) to take note of the Government's statement that the individuals arrested under the prompt measures of security were immediately released and that the occupation of various trade union premises was purely temporary and that the freedom of trade union organisations to conduct their own affairs is recognised;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to inform it more specifically of the present position of the union leaders Ramn Freire Pizzano and Otilio Barragn;(d) to reiterate to the Government the views set forth in paragraph  above concerning the mobilisation of workers and to request the Government to inform it of the present position in this respect of the employees of the State Telephone Service and the state-owned banks;(e) to draw the Government's attention similarly to the safeguards which should be laid down for civil servants and employees of essential services who are deprived of the right to strike and the development of voluntary bargaining procedures, and to request it to be good enough to supply details of any developments which may have occurred in this respect;(f) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will present a further report to the Governing Body once it has received the additional information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) above.Geneva,  February .

171,".The Committee previously examined this case at its meeting in May , when it reached certain final conclusions on the case as a whole, which are contained in its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ).
.On  June  the National Labour Congress of Uruguay submitted a communication in which it presented a series of observations on the basis of which it requested that the case be reconsidered. This communication having been transmitted to the Government of Uruguay, the latter replied by a letter dated  August .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.On other occasions, the Committee has considered that it could not reopen a case which it had already examined in substance and on which it had submitted final recommendations to the Governing Body, except where new evidence was adduced and brought to its notice.
.The Committee recalls that, according to the allegations contained in the original complaints, the General Council of the Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (C.P.U.S.T.A.L.) was due to be held in Montevideo from  August to  September  on the invitation of the National Labour Congress of Uruguay (C.N.T.), to discuss problems of trade union unity in Latin America and to start a study of social security in the region. According to the same allegations, the C.N.T had obtained permission from the Government to hold this meeting and visas had been granted to the national delegations which were due to attend. Nevertheless, on  August , the Government issued a decree forbidding the meeting. Some participants who had arrived in the country to attend the meeting were detained and expelled from Uruguay. With regard to the specific purpose of the meeting, it had also been alleged that its main aim was to analyse the possibility of forming a continent-wide trade union organisation, thus furthering the work begun in Brasilia in , when the Congress for Trade Union Unity was formed. The agenda comprised a review of the work accomplished by the Secretariat and of the state of organisation of the trade union movement in Latin America. The complainants maintained that the Government had violated Convention No. , which refers to the right to establish federations, as well as the legislation of Uruguay, which guarantees freedom of association and the right of assembly.
.In its reply, the Government had stated that in banning the above-mentioned meeting it acted in accordance with the relevant Constitutional and statutory standards. It referred to the fact that the Government was empowered to grant or refuse the necessary permission for the holding of any meeting aimed at making demonstrations or criticisms in favour of or against the policy of a foreign State or its international position or its actions as an entity under international Law (section , Act. No.  of  July ). The Government maintained that it had respected the Constitutional provision which guarantees the right of assembly but which, at the same time, authorises the Government, in accordance with the law, to restrict this right in order to guarantee safety and public order. In deciding to impose the ban, the Government took into account the background and circumstances of the case; viz. the political aim of the meeting, the affiliations of the delegates, the links between this meeting and the decisions concerning internal subversion and the violent overthrow of governments, embodied in the resolutions of the Havana Tri-Continental Conference, and the need for strict compliance with the State's international obligations. The Government had also explained in its reply that permission to hold the meeting had never been applied for or obtained and that no entry visas into the country had been granted, since in any case such visas were not necessary for Latin American citizens. None of the foreign delegates had been detained but as the meeting could not be held they were informed that they should leave the country. The Government stated that no Uruguayan trade union organisation had requested the repeal of the measure and maintained that Convention No.  did not apply to this case, which involved the prohibition of a meeting of foreign representatives on national territory.
.In examining the information submitted by the complainants and by the Government, the Committee noted the contradiction between the information supplied by the two parties. It also recalled the importance it had always attached to the fact that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right to hold trade union meetings or impede the lawful exercise thereof, but considered that in the present case the actual point at issue appeared to be the sovereign right of a country to grant or refuse entry to foreigners wishing to come into it. In this connection it pointed out that it was not called upon to deal with the general question of the status of aliens, which was not covered by international Conventions, and it referred to another case in which it had decided not to examine certain allegations that the authorities of a country had refused visas to the workers' delegates of a foreign trade union organisation, thus preventing them from taking part in a trade union congress held on territory which was then under the jurisdiction of these authorities. The Committee consequently recommended the Governing Body to decide that this case called for no further examination.
.In its latest communication, the National Labour Congress of Uruguay maintains that the real point at issue was not that stated by the Committee but recognition by the Government of the right of assembly since, according to the Government, it was indispensable to obtain official authorisation in order to exercise this right. According to the complainants this criterion is a contradiction of article  of the Constitution, which guarantees the right of peaceful assembly without arms, which shall not be denied by any authority in the Republic except by virtue of a law and only when public health, safety and order are threatened "". Act No.  of  June  regulates this Constitutional provision and does not stipulate that prior authorisation must be obtained in order to exercise the right of assembly. On the other hand, the complainants maintain that Act. No.  of  July , to which the Government referred, is unconstitutional according to national legal theory and case law.
.Repeating what it had already stated with regard to the aim of the meeting which was to be held, the complainants reject the Government's argument that the measure was adopted to meet the need of guaranteeing public order, being confined to banning a subversive meeting. They maintain in this respect that neither the intentions of the organisers nor the items on the agenda of the meeting gave the Government any justification for considering, as stated in the preamble to the decree banning the meeting, that "" it is undesirable in the present circumstances to allow the said meeting to take place in the light of the proclamation of insurrection issued by the recent Havana Congress and the repercussions which such a meeting might have on the relations maintained by the Republic with other countries of the continent "".
.The complainants refer in this respect to the opinion expressed by the I.L.O. working party set up in Uruguay (with tripartite membership and advisory informative functions). On  December  this working party sent a memorandum to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, in response to the Government's request for a report. It was stated in this memorandum that "" only in the event of a breach of the law, that is to say when legal grounds can be invoked, is there any justification for the restriction of a right as widely recognised as the right of assembly of trade union organisations and Confederations. The members of the working party consider that the text of the resolution of  August, as published in the official gazette, invokes no legal grounds which might justify the curtailment of freedom of association, as constituted by the banning of a meeting of the type planned "".
.In its reply, the Government states that it wishes to raise no objection to further discussion of this case or to its being studied in all its aspects. It repeats its respect for trade union rights, in accordance with the national and international provisions which govern them with a view to ensuring their effectiveness within the public order upheld by the law. The Government points out that although the complainants have put forward no new facts in their communication, it wishes to make a number of observations on certain statements contained therein.
.With regard to the resolution of  August , the Government states that Act No. , under which the resolution was issued, is a provision currently in force in the country which the Government is obliged to apply. This Act",0,1967,Uruguay
172,"has never been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Justice nor, in the  years during which it has been in force, has its Constitutionality ever been questioned before this body. The Act was applied in  on the same grounds in accordance with the Constitution, which establishes the possibility of restricting the right of assembly by means of a law whenever public safety and order may be endangered. In this respect, the Uruguayan Constitution corresponds to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in providing that: "" No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those which are prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""
.The Government points out that in its reply to the original complaints it has already given the reasons for which it considered that the proposed meeting might affect safety and public order, thus coming within the provisions of Act No. . It adds to these reasons the fact that the resolutions adopted by the C.P.U.S.T.A.L at its meeting in Montevideo in  were of a purely political nature and were directed against the Organisation of American States (O.A.S.), of which Uruguay is a member, and against the governments of various American States with which the country maintains diplomatic relations. In these circumstances, it was clear that the new meeting would take the same attitude as that adopted in , the situation being further aggravated by the fact that the meeting would have to express its solidarity with the subversive policy recommended by the Havana Tri-Continental Conference of  and by the Conference of the Latin American Solidarity Organisation (), which Uruguay had denounced as violating international law and the principle of non-intervention. The Government repeats that it was on the grounds of all these considerations that it decided to ban the meeting in question with a view to ensuring public order.
.The Committee notes that the complainants request a re-examination of the case with regard to the right of assembly, which is alleged to have been infringed by the Government. In this respect, the complainants submit further evidence in stating that the Act on which the decision to ban the proposed meeting was based was considered unconstitutional under Uruguayan legal theory and case law, and refer to the opinion expressed by the I.L.O. working party, according to which this decision was unjustified. For its part, the Government maintains that the allegations submitted by the complainants do not, in fact, contain new evidence, but it states that although the Committee has already given a ruling on this case, it has no objection to all its aspects and possible repercussions being considered. With regard to the alleged unconstitutionality of the Act referred to, the Government points out that no ruling to this effect has ever been given by the Supreme Court.
.The Committee considers that basically both the complainants and the Government have repeated the facts originally stated, although certain additional information has been provided in connection with national legislation on the right of assembly. On the basis of these facts, the Committee considered that it should formulate its conclusions on the measures adopted by the Government against the foreign delegates who were to take part in the meeting; these conclusions were not contested by the complainants.
.In their latest communication the complainants have submitted a series of considerations in order for the Committee to re-examine the question from the point of view of the exercise of the right of assembly of trade union organisations and, in view of the position adopted by the Government with regard to this request, the Committee considers it appropriate to formulate its observations on this aspect of the case.
.In this respect, the Committee has stated on many occasions) that the right of trade unions to meet freely in their own premises, without need for prior authorisation and without control by the public authorities, constitutes a fundamental element of freedom of association. The Committee has also considered that the organisations concerned must observe the general provisions applicable in a country with regard to public meetings. In these cases, it rests with the government, which is responsible for the maintenance of public order and the exercise of police authority, to decide whether meetings, including trade union meetings, may in certain special circumstances endanger public order and security and to take adequate preventive measures
.In the present case, the Government adopted the measure without considering whether the meeting would be of a private or public nature. The Government had based its decision on the political nature which the meeting might have had, as could be supposed from the previous meetings of the C.P.U.S.T.A.L, at which statements had been made against the O.A.S and against other American countries with which Uruguay maintains diplomatic relations. They also referred to the connection which the meeting might have with certain resolutions concerning internal subversion adopted, for example, by the Havana Tri-Continental Conference. This suggestion has been rejected by the complainants, who repeat that the objectives and agenda of the meeting related strictly to trade union matters. The government measure is legally based on Act No. , which empowers the Government to grant or refuse permission to hold meetings aimed at making demonstrations against the policy of a foreign State, its international position or its actions as an entity in international law. In view of the above considerations, the Government maintains that the purpose of the measure was to ensure public order.
.The Committee notes that the complainants and the Government disagree with regard to the Constitutionality of the above-mentioned Act, and that whilst the Government provides certain specific information on its application in the past, the complainants have supplied no evidence to support their statement that this Act is considered contrary to the Constitution of Uruguay by national legal theory and case law.
.On the basis of the above considerations, the Committee confirms that this case involves a problem relating to the right of assembly of trade union organisations in a situation where, according to the Government, the exercise of this right could have repercussions of a political nature which would affect the international position of the Government of Uruguay as well as safety or public order.
.In a previous case, the Committee had to examine allegations concerning a national trade union congress which was banned by the authorities on the grounds of certain specific facts which gave reason to believe that the meeting was in danger of losing its trade union objectives and of being used for political ends. On that occasion, the Committee decided to call the attention of the Government to the desirability of giving the trade union movement the greatest possible measure of freedom of action in the occupational sphere which was compatible with the maintenance of public order. At the same time, the Committee pointed out that it would be desirable for the parties concerned to have regard, in the interests of the normal development of the trade union movement, to the principles enunciated in the resolution adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th () Session. This resolution declares in particular that the fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement is the economic and social advancement of the workers and that when trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of the trade union movement or its social or economic functions, irrespective of political changes in the country.
.With regard particularly to the political activities of trade unions, the Committee also recalls the conclusions of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, to the effect that the general a priori prohibition of the political activities of trade unions may raise difficulties by reason of the fact that the interpretation given in practice to the relevant provisions may change at any moment and restrict considerably the possibility of action of the organisations. For this reason the authorities should only repress abuses which might be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be the economic and social advancement of the workers.
.The Committee takes account of the fact that the present case relates not to the congress of a national organisation but to a trade union meeting of an international nature. This type of meeting may give rise to special problems, not only because of the nationality of the participants but also in connection with the international policy and commitments of the",0,1967,Uruguay
173,"country in which the meeting is to take place. In this connection the government of a particular country may consider it necessary to adopt restrictive measures on the grounds of certain special circumstances prevailing at a particular time.
.The Committee considers that such measures might be justified in exceptional cases, having regard to specific situations, and provided they conform to the laws of the country. However, it should never be possible to apply measures of a general nature against particular trade union organisations unless in each case sufficient grounds exist to justify the government decision-such as genuine dangers which may arise for the international relations of a State or for safety and public order. Otherwise the right of assembly, the exercise of which by international organisations should also be recognised, would be seriously restricted.
.In the case under examination there is disagreement between the complainants and the Government with regard to the aims of the meeting which motivated the decision adopted by the Government. There is also disagreement as to the legality of this decision, mainly in the light of the Constitutional provisions. On the one hand questions of fact are involved on which the Committee lacks sufficient evidence to judge the full implications of the case, and, on the other hand, questions of national law, on which the Committee is not competent to express an opinion. As far as possible, such questions should be raised before the appropriate judicial authorities of the country, which in the present case the complainants have apparently not done.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to the observations contained principally in paragraphs , , ,  and , that the allegations in the case do not call for further examination.
.In a communication dated  August  to the I.L.O the Secretariat of the Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (C.P.U.S.T.A.L.), which has its headquarters in Santiago, Chile, lodged a complaint against the Government of Uruguay alleging that it had banned a meeting of its General Council in Montevideo and had arrested some of the delegates. In two further communications dated  and  September  the authors of the complaint supplied additional information and also indicated that the National Labour Congress of Uruguay (C.N.T.) was affiliated to their organisation.
.The three communications mentioned in the previous paragraph were transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  October . The Government replied in a letter dated  February . At its sessions on  and  February  the Committee decided to postpone its examination of the case since the Government's observations had arrived too late to be examined on that occasion.
.On  February  the I.L.O received an undated communication from the C.N.T containing allegations to the effect that by forbidding the meeting in question, the Government had violated the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). A copy of this communication was forwarded to the Government.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Secretariat of the C.P.U.S.T.A.L states that the General Council of this Organisation was due to be held in Montevideo from  August to  September  on the invitation of the C.N.T. The purpose of this meeting was "" the discussion of problems of trade union unity concerning Latin American workers, and also starting a study of social security in the region "". According to the complaint the C.N.T obtained permission from the Government beforehand and visas were granted to the delegations from the national trade union organisations which were due to attend. On  August  the Government issued a decree forbidding the meeting.
.The complainants state that on  August two delegates from a Chilean trade union organisation and a delegate from a Venezuelan trade union organisation, all of them members of the General Secretariat of the C.P.U.S.T.A.L, together with the Technical Secretary, arrived in Montevideo. These persons were, according to the complainants, detained for a number of hours, taken to the airport and expelled from the country.
.In the complainants' view these events constitute a flagrant breach of international Conventions. They state that the decree forbidding the meeting was "" based on false assertions and imputations that had nothing to do with the trade union movement "".
.The C.N.T claims in the communication mentioned in paragraph  above that, in issuing its decree banning the meeting of the General Council of the C.P.U.S.T.A.L, the Government violated the obligations it had assumed by ratifying Convention No.  with respect to the right to establish federations, as well as the domestic legislation of Uruguay itself, which protects freedom of association and the right of assembly. The C.N.T states that the proposed meeting intended to concentrate on a discussion of the possibility of forming a continent-wide trade union organisation and was intended to continue on a wider scale the work begun in Brasilia in , when the C.P.U.S.T.A.L was formed. The agenda, according to the C.N.T, comprised a review of the work accomplished by the Permanent Secretariat and of the state of organisation of the trade union movement in Latin America.
.Replying to the allegations of the Permanent Secretariat of the C.P.U.S.T.A.L, the Government states that the decree of  August  was entirely in accordance with the relevant Constitutional and statutory standards. It adds that in Uruguay "" the Government is empowered to grant or refuse the necessary permission for the holding of any meeting aimed at making demonstrations or criticisms in favour of or against the policy of a foreign State or its international position or its actions as a body corporate under international law "" (section  of Act No.  of  July ). The Government banned the meeting in accordance with the Constitutional provisions which make it responsible for maintaining domestic law and order and also observed the provision of the Constitution which guarantees the right of assembly but authorises the Government, in accordance with the law, to restrict this right in order to guarantee safety and public order.
.The Government states that, in deciding to impose the ban, account was taken of the background and circumstances of the case, viz. the political aim of the meeting, the affiliations of the delegates, the links between this meeting and the decisions concerning internal subversion and the violent overthrow of governments embodied in the resolutions of the Havana Tri-Continental Conference, the need for strict compliance with Uruguay's international obligations, etc.
.It adds that, contrary to the assertions of the complainants, permission from the Government to hold the meeting was never applied for or obtained and that no Uruguayan authority granted any visas or authorisations of any kind for the participation of foreign delegates. The delegates did not seek authorisation to enter the country, as most of them were citizens of Latin American countries who would not need to obtain tourist visas.
.It goes on to state that neither the C.N.T nor any other Uruguayan trade union organisation had asked the Government to revoke the decree and it rejects the charge that it has in any way violated International Labour Conventions. In particular it considers that Convention No.  has no connection with the case, which involves the prohibition of a meeting of foreign representatives on national territory.
.Lastly, the Government declares that none of the representatives who arrived in Montevideo was detained or arrested. As the meeting could not be held, they were told that they should leave Uruguayan territory.
.The Committee notes in the first place that there is a contradiction between the information supplied by the complainants and the Government not only as regards the purpose of the meeting but also concerning the actual events giving rise to the complaint. The Government confirms that it took the measure in question but categorically denies that the authorities had given permission for this meeting to be held in Uruguay or for the foreign delegates to enter the country.
.While the Committee has consistently emphasised the importance it has always attached to the fact that freedom from government interference in the holding or proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights, as well as to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, the actual point at issue appears, in the present case, to be the sovereign right of a country to grant or deny entry to foreigners wishing to enter it. In this respect the Committee has taken the view ever since its earliest reports that it is not called upon to deal with the general question of the status of aliens, which is not covered by International Labour Conventions. In one case the Committee, in accordance with this principle, had to decide not to examine allegations that the diplomatic authorities of one country, by refusing the necessary visas, had",-1,1967,Uruguay
174,"prevented the representatives of a trade union Confederation in another country from attending a trade union congress held within territory which was at that time under the jurisdiction of the first country.
.In these circumstances, and in view of the Government's statement to the effect that the foreign delegates arriving in the country to attend the meeting in question were neither detained nor arrested, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,1967,Uruguay
175,".The present case has already been examined by the Committee at its nd Session (October ), when it was decided to ask the Government for additional information on several aspects of the complaint. This was presented by the Uruguayan Federation of Salaried Employees in Commerce and Industry and set forth in a communication from that organisation dated  April , supplemented by another of  May . The Government of Uruguay sent its observations by letter dated  May  and gave the requested additional information in a letter of  May .
.At its th Session (May ) the Committee decided to defer consideration of the case until the autumn session because the additional information sent by the Government had arrived too late to be able to be examined in May.
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint presented by the Uruguayan Federation of Salaried Employees in Commerce and Industry comprises five sets of allegations : the first concerns government interference in the appointment of members of wages councils; the second refers to government interference in the holding of a ballot to determine whether a strike should be continued or called off; the third to collective bargaining without consultation of the most representative trade unions and in spite of their categorical opposition; the fourth to the absence of measures to protect the workers against dismissal for anti-union reasons; and the fifth to a Bill to introduce regulations governing trade unions. Each set of allegations is discussed separately below.Allegations relating to Government Interference in the Appointment of Workers' Representatives on Wages Councils
.The complainants alleged that under the Decision of  September  the representatives of the textile workers on the Wages Council for that industry, who had been appointed in accordance with the relevant national legislation and enjoyed the support of the organisation representing the workers concerned, were replaced by persons who enjoyed the trust of the public authorities but were not members of the industry in question and were consequently repudiated by the union directly concerned and all the other workers' organisations.
.In its reply dated  May  the Government stated that the workers' representatives were replaced because the situation had arisen for which provision is made in section  of the Act of  November , namely:The decisions of the wages councils shall be adopted by a simple majority, but no vote in respect of wages may be taken without such vote being placed on the agenda and without notice thereof being given at least  hours beforehand Provided that a vote may be taken without the foregoing conditions being complied with if it is unanimously so decided. For a vote to be valid all three sectors must be represented by delegates.In cases where the absence from three sittings of one or more delegates renders it impossible for valid decisions to be taken, any member shall be empowered to request the Ministry of Industries and Labour that substitutes be co-opted to the Council, in accordance with the established procedure.The Government added that the replacement was consequently effected in accordance with the procedure laid down by law, and that though there exists a right to appeal against administrative decisions (article  of the Constitution) to a body completely independent from the political authorities (the Administrative Disputes Tribunal), which has jurisdictional powers and enjoys the utmost confidence of all sectors of public opinion, no appeal had been made to the aforementioned body against the administrative act in question. The Government further stated that national practice had always held that in cases where delegates had to be appointed by the authorities the persons chosen should not be members of the industry involved; that this was how the Executive Power had always understood it; and that the signatory to the complaint himself, Mr. Jos d'Elia, had also shared this view, even though he now took the opposite stand. As proof it attached a copy of the Official Gazette dated  February , in which it is stated that Mr. Jos d'Elia was appointed by the authorities to be workers' representative in the plastics industry, in which he had never worked.
.The Committee observed that, while the complainants contended that the person appointed as workers' representative on the Wages Council came from outside the industry in question-the textile industry in this instance-the Government declared that it had followed the procedure laid down by law for cases of repeated absence of titular members, and that according to national practice representatives appointed by the authorities should not be members of the industry involved, this view having been shared by the signatory to the complaint himself when he agreed on an earlier occasion to his appointment by the authorities as workers' representative on the wages council of an industry in which he had never worked.
.The Committee observed that section  of Act No.  of  November  establishing the wages councils stipulates that candidates for election as representatives must be drawn from a list of "" salaried and wage-earning employees in the industry or trade or belonging to trade union bodies."".
.The Committee considered, moreover, that the fact that one of the complainants had at one time shared the Government's viewpoint and accepted appointment as workers' representative on a wages council for an industry in which he had never worked, did not preclude him from adopting a condemnatory attitude now, in a similar case.
.The Committee felt that the appointment by the authorities, to replace the workers' delegate, of a person from outside the industry concerned appeared to run counter to section , quoted above, in which it is stated that the representation of the workers in a given industry on the wages council for that industry should be entrusted to workers in that industry and no other.
.Before going further into this aspect of the case the Committee decided to ask the Government to give the reasons why members of wages councils appointed by the authorities should be persons from outside the industry concerned and not members of it as stipulated by section  of the above-mentioned Act when referring to the election of workers' representatives on wages councils.
.In its reply of  May  the Government states that opinions are divided as regards the conditions which members of wages councils appointed by the authorities are required to fulfil; whereas the chair of labour law in the Faculty of Law, the Executive Power and trade union leaders consider that such members do not have to fulfil the conditions required by law in respect of members nominated by the occupational associations (inter alia, the requirement of belonging to the industry or occupation concerned), a second school of thought-including the Office of the Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Industries and Labour-considers that members appointed by the authorities should fulfil all the said conditions; but neither statute nor doctrine justifies the statement that persons outside the industry or occupation necessarily must be appointed.
.The Committee observes that there does not appear to be a clear doctrine as to the conditions which must be fulfilled by persons appointed by the authorities to complete the membership of the wages councils and notes the Government's view that neither statute nor doctrine justifies the statement that persons outside the industry or occupation must be appointed. The Committee observes that in Uruguay wages are determined in general by a network of wages councils, the function of which is to fix minimum wages.
.Uruguay has ratified the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ). Under Article , paragraph , of that Convention "" the employers and workers concerned shall be associated in the operation of the machinery, in such manner and to such extent, but in any case in equal numbers and on equal terms, as may be determined by national laws or regulations "". The principle that it should be "" the employers and workers concerned "" who should take part in the deliberations and decisions of the wage-fixing body is also set forth in the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Recommendation,  (No. ).
.The above principle is embodied in Uruguayan legislation by Act No.  of . However, as regards the appointment of members of wages councils by the authorities, the legal position seems to be doubtful. In these circumstances and having regard to the fact that Convention No.  provides for the association of employers and workers ""in such manner and to such extent, but in any case in equal numbers and on equal terms, as may be determined by national laws and regulations "", the Committee recommends the Governing Body to suggest to the Government that it, might care to consider providing that, in the exceptional event of neither the titular t nor the deputy workers' or employers' representative on a wages council discharging his functions, the member appointed by the authorities shall normally be a person belonging to the industry or occupation",0,1961,Uruguay
176,"concerned.Allegations relating to Government Interference in the Holding of a Ballot to Determine whether a Strike Should Be Continued or Called Off
.The complainants alleged that a Decision of  March  gave effect to a proposal, originating with an unidentified group of workers in the undertaking concerned and supported by the management, that a ballot be held to determine the desires of the workers with regard to the continuance or calling off of a strike. They added that steps of this kind had been taken without consultation of the most representative organisation and notwithstanding its clear opposition.
.The Government stated in its first reply that there is no statutory provision forbidding the holding of a ballot-at the request of the workers concerned-to decide whether to end or continue a strike, subject to the guarantees that the ballot be secret and that only workers take part to the exclusion of all outside parties whose interest in the continuance or ending of the strike might be motivated by other than plainly occupational reasons. The Government found it remarkable that an organisation of workers should consider it an act of interference "" for the Executive Power to collaborate with a view to the settlement of occupational problems free from coercion "" through the guarantee of a secret ballot among those concerned alone with no interference from outside parties who might have ulterior motives. The Government added in conclusion that in this case also no appeal had been made to the Administrative Disputes Tribunal.
.The Committee observed that, while the complainants alleged interference by the Government in the holding of a ballot to determine whether a strike should be continued or called off, the Government, on its side, found it remarkable than an organisation of workers should consider it an act of interference for the Executive Power to collaborate with a view to the settlement of occupational problems, and felt that before proceeding further with its examination of this aspect of the case it would wish the Government to specify the circumstances which led to the collaboration of the Executive Power and the exact form which this collaboration took.
.In its letter of  May  the Government transmits the text of the decision ordering a ballot to be held among the personnel of the undertaking affected by the strike. This states that the ballot was requested by a group of employees of the company concerned and that, provided exercise of the Constitutional right to strike is not thereby restricted, there is no reason why the Government should not accede to their request. Accordingly the Wages Councils Elections Tribunal was entrusted with organisation of the ballot.
.The Committee has dealt on many occasions with cases in which denial of the right to strike was alleged, and has followed the principle that it is competent in such matters in so far, but only in so far, as the prohibition affects the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee observes that in the present case there has been no prohibition of a strike. The Government expressly states that, in consequence of the Constitutional provisions which are in force, it is itself unable to adopt measures which would restrict the right to strike, from which it would seem to appear also that the exercise of this right cannot be prohibited by the Government when the results of the ballot are known. The Committee also observed that the organisation of the ballot was entrusted to a permanent, independent body and that the workers enjoyed the safeguard of a secret ballot.
.The Committee recommends the Governing Body to note the Government's statement that the Constitution does not empower it to restrict the exercise of the right to strike, but to emphasise the desirability, in situations such as that which arose in the present case, of consulting representative organisations with a view to ensuring freedom from any influence or pressure by the authorities which might affect the exercise of this right in practice.Allegations relating to Collective Bargaining Without Consultation of the Most Representative Trade Unions and in Spite of Their Categorical Opposition
.The complainants alleged that under a Decree dated  January  it is permitted to register multilateral agreements between undertakings and sections of their employees without consultation of the most representative trade unions and in spite of their categorical opposition.
.The Government first replied that in Uruguay it has always been understood that collective agreements may be concluded not only between members of organisations but also between undertakings and their employees, and that this is the understanding in national legislation, in Bills now under discussion and in the draft Labour Code, which has been signed without dissent by the legal adviser to the Uruguayan Federation of Salaried Employees in Commerce and Industry.
.The Committee observed that section  of the Decree of  January  stipulates that "" where no collective agreement has been registered by the most representative trade unions, the National Labour Institute is empowered to register agreements between undertakings and their personnel provided they are concluded by the management of the undertaking concerned and at least  per cent of its employees "". The Committee decided to ask the Government for additional information on this aspect of the case.
.In its reply of  May  the Government states that a collective agreement may be concluded between an undertaking and  per cent of its personnel even though an agreement between organisations is being negotiated at the time or it is intended to negotiate one; the personnel of an undertaking cannot be expected, the Government argues, to abstain from reaching an agreement on the leave system which suits it best merely because of a negotiation or intention which is by no means certain to bear fruit.
.The Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which Uruguay has ratified, calls (in Article ) for measures ""to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment..."". The Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ), Paragraph  (), defines a collective agreement as an agreement concluded between "" an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers' organisations "" and "" one or more representative workers' organisations or, in the absence of such organisations, the representatives of the workers."".
.The Committee observes that the above-mentioned international instruments stress the role of workers' organisations as one of the parties in collective bargaining; they refer to representatives of unorganised workers only when there is no organisation. In these circumstances the Committee considers that direct negotiation between the undertaking and its employees, by-passing representative organisations where these exist, may be detrimental to the principle that negotiation between employers and organisations of workers should be encouraged and promoted.
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the desirability of considering the possibility of taking steps to give full effect in the legislation to the aforesaid principle of collective bargaining with workers' representative organisations which is enunciated in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ).Allegations relating to the Absence of Measures to Protect the Workers against Dismissal for Anti-Union Reasons
.The complainants alleged that the Government had consistently failed to take adequate steps to protect the workers against dismissal from undertakings in an obviously discriminatory manner intended to encroach on freedom of association. They added that the victims of such measures had included officials of the complaining organisation, and that each such matter was brought to the notice of the authorities in due time.
.The Government stated in its first reply that obviously the Executive Power should confine its activities to ensuring compliance with the law, that any disputes which occur should be settled in accordance with legal procedure, and that only a person unacquainted with the principles governing a law-abiding State could claim that the Executive Power is invading the field of competence of the Judicial Power.
.The Committee recalled that under Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Uruguay, workers must enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. The same Article further specifies that such protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities. The Committee noted that some of the alleged acts are of the very type that Convention No.  seeks to prevent. In view of the importance which the Committee has always attached to faithful observance of the principles embodied in this Convention, and bearing in mind that Article  of the Convention provides that machinery appropriate to national conditions shall be established where necessary for the purpose of ensuring respect for the right to organise, the Committee felt that in order to be able",0,1961,Uruguay
177,"to reach a final decision on this particular allegation in full awareness of the facts it should be informed as to what statutory or other provisions exist for the protection of the workers of Uruguay against any act calculated to cause their dismissal or otherwise prejudice them by reason of union membership, and also as to whether there is machinery to ensure respect for the right to organise.
.In its reply of  May  the Government states that as regards the protection of trade union officers against dismissal, although there is no statute ensuring the employment security of such persons, the rules laid down in Convention No.  are applied and Act No.  provides for sanctions in case of infringement.
.Article  of Convention No.  provides that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment "". In this connection the Government points out that any infringement of the provisions of the Convention is punishable under domestic law and that any disputes which occur should be handled in accordance with legal procedure. But Article  of the Convention provides further that "" machinery appropriate to national conditions shall be established, where necessary "" to ensure respect for the right to organise. As the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations pointed out in its conclusions in  "" it may be difficult, if not impossible, for a worker to furnish proof "" regarding an act of anti-union discrimination against himself, for which reason, the experts stated, in certain countries, "" legislation affords special and more extensive protection to leaders of trade unions "". It is in such a contingency that the implementation of Article  of the Convention is of special importance.
.In these circumstances, since acts of discrimination against workers, including trade union officers, appear to have been committed-a fact which the Government does not deny-and having regard to the consideration set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to suggest to the Government that it may care to examine the problem of anti-union discrimination in Uruguay and to take special concrete action which will afford adequate protection to workers, as appropriate to national conditions, in accordance with the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).Allegations relating to a Bill to Introduce Regulations Governing Trade Unions
.The complainants alleged that the Government intends to approve a Bill dated  February  under which-(a) trade unions would be required to obtain previous authorisation to carry on activity; (b) restrictions would be imposed on trade unions with regard to the right to draw up their statutes; (c) the public authorities would be empowered to make the granting of legal personality to occupational organisations subject to certain conditions; and (d) restrictions would be placed on the right to form federations and Confederations. In addition, the complainants argued that the Bill fails to give the workers and their organisations any safeguard against what are described in Convention No.  as "" acts of interference ""; that it allows-and even authorises-organisations under the domination of employers to enter into collective agreements; and that it makes the exercise of fundamental trade union rights, such as the right to strike, subject to the completion of formalities in which the representative trade union organisations have no part and over which they have no control. By their communication of  May  the complainants sent a copy of the Bill and additional information concerning it.
.In its first reply the Government said it was remarkable that the complaining organisation should raise this question when it was common knowledge that the Bill had not yet come before Parliament; notwithstanding this, the Ministry of Industries and Labour held the view that the framing of regulations governing trade union activities is a task which irrevocably falls upon the government in a law-abiding State.
.In a number of cases the Committee has had to decide how far it should go in expressing an opinion on proposed legislation. While in some cases the Committee has recommended the dismissal of allegations in this regard on the grounds either that the allegations were too vague or that the Bill in question had not been sponsored by the government, it has nevertheless remarked that in the face of precise and detailed allegations concerning a proposed enactment the fact that the allegations relate to a text which does not have the force of law should not of itself prevent the Committee from expressing its opinion on the merits of the allegations made. It has expressed the opinion that in such circumstances it is desirable that the government and the complainants should be made aware of the Committee's point of view with regard to a proposed Bill before this is enacted, in view of the fact that it is open to the government, on whose initiative such a matter depends, to make any amendments which may seem desirable.
.Although in the present case the Government stated that the Bill has not yet come before Parliament, the Committee was not absolutely clear as to whether it had been completely dropped. In these circumstances the Committee felt that before going; further into this aspect of the case it should ask the Government whether there is any likelihood that the Bill in question will come before Parliament at a later stage.
.In its reply of  May  the Government states that the draft trade union regulations of  February  were removed from the Bill in which they had been included and that, owing to its defects, the Bill was never considered by Parliament. The Government also states that removal of the draft from the Bill makes it impossible for Parliament to give it formal consideration.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the above statement by the Government, but expresses the hope that, if any Bill to regulate trade unions should be contemplated in the future, full regard will be had to the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Uruguay.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to suggest to the Government that it might care to consider providing that, in the exceptional event of neither the titular nor the deputy workers' (or employers') representative on a wages council discharging his functions, the member appointed by the authorities shall normally be a person belonging to the industry or occupation concerned;(b) to take note, as regards the allegation relating to governmental interference in a strike, of the Government's statement that the Constitution does not empower it to restrict the exercise of the right to strike, but to emphasise the desirability, in situations such as that which arose in the present case, of consulting representative organisations with a view to ensuring freedom from any influence or pressure by the authorities which might affect the exercise of this right in practice;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the desirability of considering the possibility of taking steps to give full effect in the legislation of the principle of collective bargaining with workers' representative organisations, which is enunciated in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. );(d) to suggest to the Government that it may care to examine the problem of antiunion discrimination in Uruguay, having regard to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above, and to take special concrete action which will afford adequate protection to workers as appropriate to national conditions, in accordance with the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. );(e) to take note, as regards the allegations relating to a Bill to introduce regulations governing trade unions, of the Government's statement that consideration of the draft by Parliament has become impossible, but to express the hope that, if any Bill to regulate trade unions should be contemplated in the future, full regard will be had to the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Uruguay.",0,1961,Uruguay
178,".It would appear from the analysis of the case as a whole that the emergency measures taken by the Government, pursuant to article  of the Constitution, were submitted without delay for approval by Parliament and were revoked as soon as the situation returned to normal. It would also appear that certain fundamental rights of the workers, for example the right of free trade union meeting and the right of habeas corpus, had also been temporarily restricted in consequence. While expressing the hope that governments, desiring to see labour relations develop in an atmosphere of mutual confidence, will have recourse, when dealing with situations resulting from strikes and lockouts, to measures provided for under common law rather than to emergency measures, which, even though taken in accordance with the national Constitution and applied subject to Parliamentary control, involve a danger, by reason of their very nature, of certain restrictions being placed on fundamental rights, the Committee observes that freedom of association, traditionally guaranteed in Uruguay, appears now to be re-established.
.In these circumstances, the Committee, subject to the observations made in paragraph  above, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case as a whole does not call for further examination.",0,1952,Uruguay
