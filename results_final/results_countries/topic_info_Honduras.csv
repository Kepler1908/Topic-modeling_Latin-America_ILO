I was hoping for a', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","['.The Committee on Freedom of Association at its meeting in May , in considering the cases concerning Honduras (Nos.  and ) requested the Government to accept a direct contacts mission, given the gravity of the allegations and the lack of information available concerning Case No.  (see th Report of the Committee, para. ), and in order that the various aspects of Case No.  might be fully examined (see th Report, para. ) . Moreover, at its November  meeting, the Committee expressed the hope that the direct contacts mission would be able to obtain information on the allegation pending in connection with Case No.  (see st Report, para. ). Finally, an allegation made in the context of Case No.  was still pending before the Committee (see th Report, para. ).\n.At the st Session of the International Labour Conference (Geneva, ) the Government representative of Honduras formally requested that the direct contacts be carried out in order to elucidate the situation and to bring the country\'s legislation into conformity with Conventions Nos.  and .\n.Subsequently, the Government of Honduras, in a communication dated  November , agreed that the mission should take place from  to  January .\n.The Director-General of the ILO appointed as his representative to carry out this mission Mr. Andrs Aguilar, ex-president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and a member of that Commission and the Committee on Human Rights. The mission took place in Tegucigalpa on the dates mentioned above. Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards, accompanied the representative of the Director-General during the mission.\n.The mission held talks with His Excellency Mr. Amado H. Nez, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and with senior officials of the Ministry, as well as representatives of the employers\' and workers\' organisations.\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee wishes first of all to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission and for his detailed report on the pending cases, which made it possible for the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General shows how useful missions of this kind are in elucidating the matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.\n.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee may proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.\n.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission to Honduras from  to  January . The Committee notes with interest the fact that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission. In this connection the Committee notes that the information obtained during the mission on the disappearance of two trade union leaders referred to in the complaints does not contain any new elements.\n.When the Committee considered this case at its May  meeting (see th Report, paras. -) two matters were still pending. First, the Committee had requested the Government to supply information on the alleged murder of Jacobo Hernndez, a trade union leader of the Honduran National Peasants\' Association (ANACH), and had called attention to the need to carry out judicial inquiries in that regard. The Committee had also requested the Government to supply information on the latest developments in the proceedings concerning the murder of Dagoberto Padilla, Ismael Ulloa, Angel Alvarado and Carlos Alcides Meja, and on the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figueroa, all leaders or members of the Workers\' Union of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (SITRACOAGS). The Committee had stressed the seriousness of the allegation that the manager and owners of SITRACOAGS were involved in the murder and attempted murders and considered that since it was a penal matter it should be subject to a criminal investigation. It therefore urged the Government to provide information on this investigation. Finally, subsequent to the latest examination of the case by the Committee, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a communication dated  October , presented new allegations concerning the disappearance of Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" Mineworkers\' Union, who was reported by the ICFTU to have been detained by soldiers of the th Infantry Brigade.\n.Concerning the death of Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, the ANACH union leader, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, proceedings commenced on  March  against Mr. Marco Tulio Pineda Torres (at present detained in the central penitentiary of Tegucigalpa) for the crime of homicide.\n.Regarding the murder of four SITRACOAGS leaders and the attempted murder of three other leaders of that organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the relevant trial for murder or attempted murder is still at the indictment stage. The Committee also takes note of the various developments that have taken place in that trial: () of those who were earlier detained on charges of murder, Mr. Alfredo Villeda Henrquez and Mr. Moiss Orellana have been found not guilty of criminal liability; () those charged with the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figuera are the subject of warrants of arrest; () Mr. Marco Antonio Molina and Mr. Fausto Isal Garca are still fugitives from justice and before escaping from prison they confessed to the judicial authorities that they had committed the murders, as may be seen from the court documents given to the mission.\n.As to the involvement of the manager (Mr. Carlos Gonzlez) and the owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (particularly, Mr. Jaime Echeverra) in the murders, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities have released these persons since there were no grounds for their continued detention.\n.Whenever allegations concerning the death or serious injury of trade union leaders or unionists have been submitted to it, the Committee has always insisted that a judicial inquiry be carried out with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties. In the present case, the Committee notes that trials are under way, and that it has been possible to identify the two alleged perpetrators of the murders or attempted murders, even though they are fugitives from justice. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the proceedings in question will be concluded as soon as possible and will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.\n.With respect to the disappearance of the trade union leader Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, the Committee takes note of the written communication given to the mission by the Minister of Labour, indicating that absolutely reliable sources have informed the security authorities that Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" workers\' union, was trafficking in explosives and was involved in other activities tending to undermine the tranquillity of the nation, peace and democracy, and that he was therefore arrested on  October . However, given that the necessary investigations proved his innocence, he was released immediately and continues to exercise his trade union functions; Mr. Guerrero is now engaged in politics and was elected a deputy to the Congress by the National Party.\n.In these conditions, in view of the fact that Mr. Guerrero was imprisoned because he was falsely accused of trafficking in explosives, and that he was freed once his innocence was proved, the Committee draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists in conditions such as those presently alleged may not only constitute a serious interference in union activities, but also may create a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of trade union activities. When taken on trade union grounds, they are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .\n.When the Committee examined this case at its May  meeting (th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )), two questions were pending. The first concerned the alleged interference by the Government in the constitution of an organisation and in the election of trade union leaders through the adoption, in , of an Act governing the constitution of the teachers\' organisation COLPROSUMAH. The Committee recalled with firmness that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to grant workers\' organisations the right to draw up their constitutions and rules and elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee therefore requested the Government to indicate what measures it envisaged taking to', ""organizations and the Government, which gave rise to protest movements and strikes, during the period from  to , caused by the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the delays in the payment of salaries in arrears, among other things.\n.Similarly, the Committee observes that the allegations refer to: () the death of a trade union activist on  March , while she was participating in a peaceful demonstration; () the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers, for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration; () the exclusion of teachers' organizations from the higher authority of the administration of INPREMA; () the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, and its de-indexation from the minimum salary (preventing the continuing use of the minimum salary as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries); () the failure to pay salary increases from  to  and the suppression of the protests to which this gave rise; () the declaration of the protest movements as illegal by the administrative authority and the resulting sanctions imposed on more than  teachers; () the suspension of the deductions in union fees for teachers' organizations; () the adoption of Decision No. -SE-, of  July , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspensions of classes; () the refusal of requests for renewal of union leave; () the unilateral suspension of Teacher Selection and Competitive Recruitment Boards; () the request for a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds obtained as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations; () the civil liability claims brought against four SINPRODOH officials, for an amount of HNL,,.; and () the professional persecution of two members of the COPEMH.\n.The Committee notes that the Government states that its actions are not directed against the SINPRODOH. It also notes the following statements by the Government: () the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez was caused by a young, reckless driver, who hit her while driving against the flow of traffic. The forensic report of the Public Prosecutor s office excludes the possibility that, prior to her fall, she had been hit by an object designed for use by the military or police; () the teachers were arrested for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association for assaulting several police officers with mortar rockets. Due process was respected at all times and, to date, no teacher has been convicted for the aforementioned facts; () the reforms outlined in Decree No.  , of  December , containing the National Social Welfare Institute for Teachers Act were based on actuarial studies carried out by the CNBS, and were disseminated among the teachers' unions in ; () Decree-Law No. -, of  October , suspended the economic regimes established in the different professional statutes, as they are fiscal measures which served as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries, to the detriment of the budgets of centralized and decentralized state institutions; in this respect, the administrative appeal lodged by the SINPRODOH was not successful, since the country s financial situation did not allow for further and greater commitments beyond those contained in the National General Income and Expenditure Budget; () the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department, and this delay (that is the failure to pay on the th day of each month) affected teachers at the national level and their unrest was understandable, which was why the Secretariat issued Decision No. -SE-, of  December , temporarily suspending the voluntary deductions for teachers to Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as union contributions and other legal and court fees. The State Secretariat of the Education Department has acted for many years as a management body to channel the deductions for teachers' unions, in line with requests made by teachers. It sent the circular letter to the six presidents of teachers' organizations belonging to the FOMH, requesting them to report on the amounts, use and handling of funds received. Voluntary deductions were resumed for the teachers' unions that had submitted the reports requested, namely the COPRUMH and the COLPEDAGOGOSH; () the adoption of Decision No. -SE-, of  June , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspension of classes, was motivated by the desire to fulfil the right to education and the minimum number of class days; () the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments has declared illegal the strikes and protests launched by teachers' representatives in the past two years; consequently, pursuant to national legislation on the disciplinary regime, Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  October , was issued, imposing sanctions involving salary deductions, temporary suspension or dismissal, as the case may be; () the refusal of the requests for renewal of paid union leave made by certain teachers is based on national legislation, which should be applied within the framework of the basic law of each teaching organization determining post duration. In this respect, there was a case in which the request for leave was indeed granted (Mr Grebil Escobar del Cid, Secretary for Finance of PRICPHMA), and another case in which the request for leave was refused because it was requested in order to take up a position that was not part of the executive board (Mr Rufino Murillo, Secretary for Internal Affairs of PRICPHMA). In most cases, the requests for renewal of paid union leave were refused because the time limit set under the regulations of the teacher s organization concerned had been exceeded; () the State Secretariat of the Education Department began a  teacher reorganization' process, which aimed to return teachers assigned to other education establishments to the schools where they had been originally appointed. As a result, needs and vacancies were identified, which led to the redistribution of posts based on the information gathered. The reorganization process was concluded in , the teacher selection boards have now been set up, and representatives from teachers' unions have been included.\n.The Committee notes with profound concern the seriousness of the allegations which include the death of a union activist, criminal proceedings and mass sanctions relating to union activities, and also significant restrictions on the union rights of officials.\n.Regarding the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez, the Committee observes that, while this highly regrettable event occurred during a demonstration organized by the teachers' organizations of Honduras, it does not seem, according to government statements, to be the result of a violation of the principles of freedom of association. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide information in their possession on this allegation and in particular whether her death was, as the Government states, due to a car accident and to indicate whether anyone has been charged or detained in this regard.\n.As regards the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their subsequent arrest, while participating in a peaceful demonstration, the Committee takes note of the statements made by the Government that they assaulted several police officers by throwing mortar rockets at them. The Committee emphasizes that the principles of freedom of association do not protect abuses consisting of criminal acts while exercising the right to strike [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee regrets the acts of violence that occurred during the demonstration and urges the Government to provide information without delay on the specific acts for which they are being prosecuted, on the status of the legal proceedings instituted and, where applicable, the outcome.\n.Concerning the dispute which is the subject of this complaint, the Committee notes the allegations relating to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, under section  of Decree-Law No. -, of  October , and also notes the economic arguments put forward by the Government. The Committee also notes that section  of the above Decree-Law states that:  within a period of  days and subject to negotiation with union organizations, the executive authority shall fix the adjustment to the base salary of public servants governed by special laws or professional statutes, in accordance with the state salary policy, without this increasing the collateral benefits'  As regards the alleged failure to pay the salary increases, the Committee observes that the Government acknowledges that the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department and that, in view of the situation, the Secretariat issued Decision No. -SE-, of  December , temporarily suspending the voluntary deductions from teachers for Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as those"", 'Adviser on Standards, accompanied the representative of the Director-General during the mission.\n.The mission held talks with His Excellency Mr. Amado H.

The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General shows how useful missions of this kind are in elucidating the matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.\n.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee may proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.\n.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission to Honduras from  to  January .

The Committee had stressed the seriousness of the allegation that the manager and owners of SITRACOAGS were involved in the murder and attempted murders and considered that since it was a penal matter it should be subject to a criminal investigation. It therefore urged the Government to provide information on this investigation. Finally, subsequent to the latest examination of the case by the Committee, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a communication dated  October , presented new allegations concerning the disappearance of Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" Mineworkers\' Union, who was reported by the ICFTU to have been detained by soldiers of the th Infantry Brigade.\n.Concerning the death of Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, the ANACH union leader, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, proceedings commenced on  March  against Mr. Marco Tulio Pineda Torres (at present detained in the central penitentiary of Tegucigalpa) for the crime of homicide.\n.Regarding the murder of four SITRACOAGS leaders and the attempted murder of three other leaders of that organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the relevant trial for murder or attempted murder is still at the indictment stage. The Committee also takes note of the various developments that have taken place in that trial: () of those who were earlier detained on charges of murder, Mr. Alfredo Villeda Henrquez and Mr. Moiss Orellana have been found not guilty of criminal liability; () those charged with the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figuera are the subject of warrants of arrest; () Mr. Marco Antonio Molina and Mr. Fausto Isal Garca are still fugitives from justice and before escaping from prison they confessed to the judicial authorities that they had committed the murders, as may be seen from the court documents given to the mission.\n.As to the involvement of the manager (Mr. Carlos Gonzlez) and the owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (particularly, Mr. Jaime Echeverra) in the murders, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities have released these persons since there were no grounds for their continued detention.\n.Whenever allegations concerning the death or serious injury of trade union leaders or unionists have been submitted to it, the Committee has always insisted that a judicial inquiry be carried out with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties.

In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the proceedings in question will be concluded as soon as possible and will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.\n.With respect to the disappearance of the trade union leader Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, the Committee takes note of the written communication given to the mission by the Minister of Labour, indicating that absolutely reliable sources have informed the security authorities that Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" workers\' union, was trafficking in explosives and was involved in other activities tending to undermine the tranquillity of the nation, peace and democracy, and that he was therefore arrested on  October .

The Committee recalled with firmness that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to grant workers\' organisations the right to draw up their constitutions and rules and elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee therefore requested the Government to indicate what measures it envisaged taking to repeal the provisions of the national legislation which are incompatible with the Convention and to enable the organisation in question to adopt its own rules in conformity with Article  of Convention No. . The second pending question referred to the non-reinstatement of  teachers, mentioned by name, who were dismissed on account of a strike in . The Committee considered that dismissal on account of a strike constituted serious discrimination in employment for the exercise of a lawful trade union activity, and was contrary to Convention No. , ratified by Honduras; it insisted that the Government state what measures it envisaged taking to secure the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers.\n.Moreover, the complainant organisation in a communication of  December  presented new allegations in which it stated that on  December Mr. Ambrosio Sabio, former President of COLPROSUMAH, had been arrested. The complainant added that it appeared that the arrest had been made at the request of the rival group formed by the Government within this organisation.\n.The Committee notes that the Minister of Labour told the mission that it would be very difficult to take steps to repeal the  Act which governs the constitution of the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH). The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the  Act was adopted by the National Congress at the request of the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH that is recognised by the authorities. The Committee observes in this connection that, according to the Government, COLPROSUMAH is not a trade union organisation but a professional college of teachers.

The Government also underlines that it is not, or has never been, its intention to violate any of the clauses, but rather to fulfil its responsibility of bailing out the Institute in order to consolidate and guarantee not only existing rights and benefits, but also to ensure the capacity to provide social security coverage, and on a sustainable basis.\n.The Government states that the oversight committee prioritized compliance with all of the priority obligations of the Labour Code and the collective agreement in  per cent of cases, and emphasizes that there has been no failure to comply with the collective agreement, but rather that circumstances and conditions arose making it impossible to meet some of the non-priority obligations of the collective agreement because of the financial crisis faced by the institution. The Government also emphasizes that it has always complied with the following clauses of the collective agreement to ensure that all workers in the Institute enjoy benefits: clause  (voluntary redundancy bonus), clause  (assistance with the cost of spectacles), clause  (assistance with funeral costs), clause  (holiday pay), clause  (special leave (prophylactic)), clause  (adjustment for seniority (five-year period)), clause  (overtime premium), clause  (group life insurance), clause  (transport for night-shift workers), clause  (paid leave), clause  (study leave), clause  (shift changes), clause  (seniority bonus) and clause  (reimbursement of medical expenses).\n.With regard to compliance with clause (h) of the collective agreement (union leave), the Government states that, on  November , the oversight committee presented evidence to counter the General Labour Inspectorate s notification informing the Institute of the imposition of penalties. The Government also emphasizes that, in accordance with the law, the oversight committee authorized unpaid union leave for the persons elected as members of the executive committee and who sought ongoing periods of leave in order to carry out trade union activities. According to the Government, this decision is based on the final subparagraph of section () of the Labour Code, which states that:  ...employers are required to ' grant union leave to the worker ' .Where a worker holds union management positions, the leave shall last for as long as the worker remains in his/her post. The employer is prohibited from paying wages for this purpose. The leave in question shall be requested by the individual trade union organization' \n.As for the alleged non-compliance with clause  of the collective agreement (public holidays), the Government states that the Institute, in order to ensure that union members benefited from prompt care in the health system, decided to allow employees compensatory time off for the days when they are required to undertake activities as part as their duties. It also states that this measure was taken to ensure the well-being of members and that they receive prompt health care. Furthermore, with respect to clause , the Government states that the Institute has been paying the minimum wage agreed in the collective agreement since October  and that the Institute has always ensured that members receive the benefits provided for in the Labour Code such as the th-month and th-month salary bonuses (clauses  and  of the collective agreement).\n.Concerning clauses  and  of the collective agreement (food and water coolers for employees), the Government states that the Institute s budgetary capacity is only sufficient to provide food for patients admitted to the country s different hospital units. The Government points out, however, that all priority and substantive obligations, arising both from the Labour Code and the collective agreement, have been paid punctually every month to all employees. The Government emphasizes that the financial crisis faced by the Institute has resulted in it taking measures to control spending, earmarking available financial resources for priority expenditure. The Government also emphasizes that, from the date its intervention began, it has been paying the monthly deductions due from permanent employees, amounting to  per cent, punctually to the trade union organization. With regard to clause  (meetings between the trade union and the Institute authorities), the Government points out that the oversight committee has engaged in communication and ongoing dialogue whenever the trade union organization has requested it to do so and, as proof of this, they attach the attendance lists of the meetings between the oversight committee and the SITRAIHSS.\n.In its communication dated  April , the Government reports that, on  December , the oversight committee signed an agreement with the Medical Association of the Honduran Social Security Institute (AMIHSS) and the Honduran Medical School (CMH) (organizations distinct from the complainant organization), which ended a strike called by the Institute s doctors to seek a salary increase. The Government reports that the oversight committee undertook in this agreement to: (i) grant medical staff a salary adjustment equivalent to  per cent, starting in January ; and (ii) grant a one-off sum equivalent to a normal salary earned from December  to those who worked throughout December without a break. The doctors, for their part, promised to return to work immediately. The oversight committee also undertook in this agreement to review two clauses of the collective agreement in the second quarter of  relating to contests for the appointment of doctors and voluntary redundancies (clauses that are not subject to the complainant s allegations of non-compliance in the present complaint).\n.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant alleges non-compliance since  with various clauses of the collective agreement concluded in  between the SITRAIHSS and the Institute (a public body responsible for providing social security and health coverage and protection from occupational risks). The Committee notes that the complainant and the Government state that, in , the Government decided to intervene in the affairs of the Institute in order to safeguard public interests, appointing for that purpose an oversight committee, which has been in charge of the Institute s administration ever since. According to the Government: (i) the intervention in the affairs of the Institute was necessary because of corruption and managerial and administrative failings, which had led to a serious crisis situation within the Institute and to its financial collapse; and (ii) the main objective of the oversight committee is to restructure personnel administration and management, enhance service quality and ensure drug supplies.\n.The Committee notes the complainant s specific allegation that, since , the oversight committee has failed to comply with nine clauses out of a total of  in the collective agreement in question. It also notes that, according to the documents attached by the complainant, in  and  the SITRAIHSS sent several letters to the oversight committee requesting it to comply fully with the collective agreement and that, in response, the oversight committee had emphasized that the intention had never been to affect employees but that, given the financial situation faced by the institution and the resultant recovery process, the main objective was to maintain sources of employment and to progressively ensure compliance with all obligations to ensure enjoyment of benefits.\n.The Committee further notes that the complainant and the Government indicate that in  and  the SITRAIHSS filed four complaints with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, alleging non-compliance with the nine clauses that are the subject of this complaint. Regarding the status of these complaints, the information provided by the complainant shows that: (i) although the Ministry of Labour imposed a penalty on the Institute for non-compliance with clause (h) (union leave was reportedly granted but only on an unpaid basis), following counter evidence presented by the oversight committee, the Ministry of Labour revoked its decision (on the basis that section () of the Labour Code prohibits employers from remunerating union leave), thereby rendering null and void the penalty imposed; and (ii) the Ministry of Labour also imposed a penalty on the Institute with respect to non-compliance with clauses  and  (food and water coolers for workers), despite which the situation has not been resolved in practice, according to the complainant. On this point, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: (i) the Institute s financial situation prevents it from covering this type of expense; (ii) budgetary capacity is only sufficient to provide food for patients admitted to the country s different hospital units; and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, the oversight committee, despite the current financial crisis situation, is complying with the priority obligations of the Labour Code and over  per cent of those arising from the collective agreement.\n.Moreover, the Committee observes that the Ministry of Labour has yet to express its position on the complaints relating to clause  (monthly meetings between the trade union and the Institute), clause  (public holidays), clause  (Christmas and New Year bonus), clause  (sum of money for the  May celebrations) and clause  (study grants). With regard to"", 'request that they be forbidden to operate and that the Labour Code expressly forbid solidarist associations from engaging in union activities such as collective bargaining.\n.More specifically, the complainant organisations allege that there have been the following violations related to solidarism:- CERVECERIA HONDUREA S.A.: At a seminar, the enterprise made moves to establish a solidarist association, offering workers an organisation running parallel to the union, with interference on the part of the employers. According to the statutes of the association, workers may participate only if they do not belong to a union (article  states that the Solidarist Association of the Employees of Cervecera Hondurea S.A. is duly established and consists of permanent employees of the enterprise who are non-union members). The statutes also indicate the duties and powers of the executive committee, which include concluding agreements and collective agreements with the enterprise, which in the opinion of the complainants is a violation of Convention No.  (section  states that the duties and powers of the executive committee are to conclude agreements and collective agreements with the enterprise on behalf of the Association). Similarly, anti-union discrimination takes place in the enterprise against workers who join the union. An example of this discrimination is the dismissal of Mrs. Yelvania del Carmen Girn.- AMERICAN PACIFIC OF HONDURAS S.A.: Organisations that are parallel to the union have been established at the enterprise, including the ""Junta de fomento"" (solidarist association) and a collective agreement committee (an agreement aimed at regulating working conditions with non-unionised workers on a collective basis), which has led to direct confrontation with the union organisation. The Junta de fomento (solidarist association) includes a financial adviser and a commissary appointed by the enterprise, which shows the level of managerial support for the solidarist organisation, as does the granting by the enterprise to the organisation of company shops, electric, water and security services, as well as an administrator and a secretary. The enterprise also finances travel, per diem and training for personnel in Costa Rica. The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has registered the collective agreement made at the enterprise with a group of non-unionised workers.- TEXTILES SAN PEDRO: The Solidarist Association of Employees of the Managerial Group of Handall Industries is in operation at this enterprise and situations similar to those described above have arisen.- POLYMER INDUSTRIAL: The constituent documents of the Solidarist Association (text provided by the complainants) at the enterprise state the aims of the Association to maintain harmonious industrial relations within the enterprise, promote the development of salaried employees and wage-earners, promote and maintain good working conditions, and encourage saving and credit among its members. The statutes of the Association authorise it to negotiate and sign collective agreements (a means by which working conditions are regulated outside the union) and provide for the posts of commissary and administrative adviser, appointed and removed from office by the enterprise. According to the statutes of the Solidarist Association, the permanent posts of commissary and administrative adviser should ensure the smooth operation of the Association. The General Assembly resolves that both positions should be occupied by members of the Association but freely appointed and removed by the Polymer general management. In addition, the Industrial Polymer enterprise, which had initially offered a collective agreement, subsequently recommended, through its most senior solidarist activist, that collective agreements not be negotiated but replaced by individual contracts. Similarly, workers belonging to the enterprise\'s trade union are suffering anti-union discrimination. Specific reference is made to Messrs. Leonel Perdomo, Miguel Angel Rivera and Santiago Mateo whose usual jobs have been changed, along with Messrs. Roney Moreira and Vitalicio Rodrguez whose contracts of employment have been terminated. Sixty-three workers have also been suspended.- ENTERPRISES IN THE POLYMER GROUP (HONDUFIBRAS AND POLITUBO): A number of workers have been dismissed for attempting to set up a union, and solidarism is gaining ground quite easily since there are no union organisations at these enterprises.- TERMOPLAST S.A.: The Solidarist Association of Termoplast Employees (ASODET) has advised its members that any attempt to join an organisation other than ASODET is a violation of its statutes (to support this, the text of a communiqu sent by ASODET is provided). Similarly, the complainants report that the Collective Agreement of Termoplast Solidarist Association (text enclosed) includes clauses which establish the sole right of the Association to represent workers\' interests and to use termination funds. The relevant clauses of the Collective Agreement state that: ""Clause  - the enterprise recognises the Association as the sole representative of the labour interests of its members and undertakes to negotiate with its executive committee in all individual or collective labour disputes which may arise ... Clause  - the enterprise agrees to transfer to the Association up to  per cent per month of the basic wage of the worker members provided that they contribute to the Association an equivalent percentage of savings, as laid down in its statutes. This transfer will be by way of trust funds and will be taken from the assets held in reserve by the enterprise for the payment of benefits to the workers.""- TELA RAIL ROAD COMPANY: The complainants state that the enterprise refuses to sign a new collective contract, offering instead to extend the current contract and to pay a lump sum. According to the complainants, the ulterior motive behind this action is the intention to introduce solidarism into the enterprise.\n.The complainant organisations state that solidarist organisations exist in other enterprises, thus restricting the freedom of association of the workers and precluding any possibility of negotiating collective agreements. (These enterprises include: Kativo de Honduras S.A., Pinturas Surekota S.A., el Banco del Ahorro, el Banco del Futuro and Empresas Camaroneras del Sur del Pas, etc.)\n.According to the complainants, the Ministry of the Interior has granted or is considering granting legal personality to various solidarist associations: the Association of Salaried Employees and Wage Earners of Polymer Industrial S.A., the Savings Association of Staff of the Kativo Company and Industrias Surekota S.A., the Solidarist Association of the Grupo Accesorios Elctricos y Controles S.A. de C.V. (ACEYCO) and various solidarist associations in enterprises dealing in hardware. Similarly, the complainants report the existence of a National Committee of Honduran Solidarist Associations, established with the aim of formulating and carrying out a plan of action which would help strengthen solidarism in Honduras.\n.The ICFTU, in a communication of  November , alleges that at the beginning of October , the management of the American Pacific Mining Company (AMPAC) of Canada dismissed  workers, including representatives of the union protected by the Labour Code, from the ""El Mochito"" mine, accusing them of spreading union propaganda at the mine. On  October , a group of workers from the enterprise protested against these dismissals by blocking the entrance to the mine. The complainant reports that the managers of the mine requested the army to intervene and there was violent repression of the workers in an effort to remove them. It is reported that the alleged army suppression resulted in the death of Mr. Daniel Carrasco and left more than  workers injured. Furthermore, the complainant organisation regards the large-scale dismissal of workers as an indication that the American Pacific enterprise seeks to replace the existing union by a solidarist association, known as the Junta de fomento.\n.The Government, in its communication of  June , states that it respects Conventions Nos.  and  and that the Secretariat of State and the Labour Inspectorate monitor their implementation. The Government reports that faced with the allegations presented, the General Directorate of the Regional Office of San Pedro Sula (a region where solidarism has a stronghold and the location of enterprises in which the alleged violation of trade union rights have taken place) carried out the appropriate investigation.\n.The Government adds that the General Directorate of the aforementioned Office reported that legally established unions were in existence in the Cervecera Hondurea S.A., American Pacific S.A., Polymer Industrial S.A. and Tela Rail Road Company, with a collective labour contract governing relations between employers and workers. Furthermore, it states that in the other enterprises (Kativo de Honduras, Pinturas Surekota S.A., Textiles San Pedro, Polytubo, Hondufibras, Polyproductos S.A., Termoplast, Banco del Ahorro Hondureo, Banco Futuro and the Grupo de Empresas Camaroneras del Sur del Pas) trade unions did not exist, since these enterprises have used various methods to avoid being notified by trade union branches of their constituent resolutions and regard all contracts of employment with employees who participate in setting up such branches as terminated.\n.As regards the solidarist associations, the Government points out that according to the General Directorate such organisations do exist in some of the aforementioned enterprises, and it indicates that these movements have not gathered enough strength to undermine the existing union organisations. Similarly, it states that investigations at various enterprises (not named) show that violations of freedom of association have not been proven.\n.The Committee notes that the complainant organisations allege:- discrimination on the part of some employers against workers who are members of unions, in', ""with various terms of the  collective agreement (this agreement continues to be in force, since the complainants allege that the Institute s authorities have blocked the negotiation of the new agreement). They also allege that the Institute does not recognize the trade union as the representative of all the workers, whether affiliates or not. Other terms that the Institute has failed to comply with include, for example, those relating to overtime hours of work, staff transportation, provision of equipment, regulatory procedures and job stability. Therefore, according to the complainants, the Institute has dismissed employees orally and in writing. The trade unions have sent many attachments.\n.In its communication of  December , the Government states that it respects union rights and that the authorities recognize SITRAIHNFA, as evidenced by the six agreements concluded in the Institute. SITRAIHNFA terminated the last collective agreement and apparently negotiated in a series of meetings with the former executive director the provisions of the collective agreement without accepting those relating to wage increases and others having economic and financial implications. The Government explains that during this time the Institute has been engulfed by a budgetary and financial crisis, to the extent that on  September , under Executive Order No. -, a state of emergency was declared at the Institute, and an intervening commission was set up. The commission was operational until January , when the current executive director was named. Under the general provisions relating to the Council of Ministers contained in Executive Orders Nos PCM-- and PCM--, his powers in dealing with the budget and financial resources have been restricted, owing to the domestic and international financial crisis affecting the State, to the extent that all wage increases are prohibited by law, a point that the complainants seek to overlook. In other words, the Government reiterates that the signing of the seventh collective agreement has not been possible in view of the country s financial situation, in particular the Institute s available budgetary resources, and the legal impediments duly shown by the executive orders that the Government attached to its communication.\n.The Government states that the allegation that dismissals at the Institute are made orally and in writing, and that the trade union is not recognized or its existence denied is not true. This allegation can easily be refuted by the many specific records and grievance records that are properly drawn up in the presence of the trade union in the Institute s Department of Human Resources. A union representative is thus present and signs the documents. The representative is granted the right to speak in defence of the workers' interests, in accordance with the rules of procedure and the collective agreement, which alone defeats this allegation.\n.The Government adds that when the bill for the establishment of the National Children s Ombudsman Office was brought before the Honduran National Congress, the members of the SITRAIHNFA Central Board of Directors were invited by the State to attend so that they too could present their initiatives and observations. The proposals of both parties are now awaiting debate in the legislative branch. In view of the preceding statement, the wording of the complaint stating that  the Government s intention is to do business with NGOs' not only lacks respect, but is totally inappropriate and does not merit any consideration whatsoever because such defamatory accusations should not be made capriciously and without substantiation to international bodies.\n.In addition, the Government considers inappropriate and capricious the statement that the executive branch intends to dissolve the Institute, and thus the trade union. The plan to set up the National Children s Ombudsman Office to replace the Institute is not the decision of the executive branch alone, since the relevant bill was drafted by a team composed of representatives of bodies engaged in international cooperation dealing with youth programmes, such as: the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations Children s Fund (UNICEF); civil society, representatives of the Inter-institutional Coordination of Private Organizations for Children and Children s Rights (COIPRODEN), an organization representing more than  organizations devoted to youth programmes; the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Victimized Children, an integral part of the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the State; and the executive branch, represented by the Justice and Human Rights Secretariat and the senior management of the Institute, based on the competencies granted by the Constitution and the legal provisions governing its institutional life. By creating a new institution, this bill aims to extend the scope of the Institute, which is oriented solely towards children at social risk or criminal law offenders. It also will also cover the human rights of the . million children of Honduras. Further, this bill falls within the frame of the Law on the Country Vision and National Plan, which in the case of the Institute, requires it to decentralize its functions through the municipalities, with the compulsory expansion of the present  municipalities in which it operates, to the  municipalities throughout the country.\n.With regard to the trade union s recognition, the Government states that apparently the complainants do not recall the contents of clause  of the collective agreement in force that states as follows:  If for whatever reason the Honduras Institute of Children and the Family should change its name or its representatives, the new authority shall continue being the  employer' in matters of employment. The relation will be governed by the rules of procedure in force, in addition to the provisions of the present collective agreement, and by the Labour Code, as a legal framework. In all cases the trade union will be recognized automatically as the legitimate representative of the professional and general interests of its respective members with whatever name is adopted by the new institution.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:\n.Concerning the alleged impediments to collective bargaining, the Government denies impediments by the Institute and refers to the records of grievance hearings granted on behalf of the workers and to specific records referring to the conciliation produced by the mediation of the Secretariat of Labour aimed at bringing a halt to the countless illegal walkouts by the trade union that cause prejudice to the children and the Institute. In all these documents the union appears precisely as the workers' representative.\n.With respect to the alleged violation by the Institute s authorities of the employment agreement, the Government states that according to the trade union, the terms range from those relating to payment of overtime hours of work to the alleged violation of constitutional guarantees, the obligation to provide staff transportation under certain conditions, the provision of furniture and equipment, the application of regulatory procedures to staff, job stability and so forth. The Government points out that there is little substance in these allegations and if they were true, this would require intervention or the permanent closing of the Institute.\n.The Government also states that the complainant has not exhausted all administrative remedies concerning the allegations. Concerning the application of clause  of the collective agreement that was challenged by a series of temporary workers claiming such clause as the basis for recognition of their status as fixed-term workers, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice ruled in favour of the Institute, dismissing the case against the Institute.\n.With regard to the alleged non-compliance with the clause of the sixth collective agreement guaranteeing the administrative and managerial freedom of the Institute with respect to the necessary resources for achieving its ends, without further obligations or constraints than those set out in the Constitution of Honduras, in the laws, in the regulations and in the present collective agreement, the Government states that despite giving timely notification to some temporary workers of the termination of their contracts, the administration of the Institute lawfully and repeatedly advised the former workers to claim amounts to which they could be found legally entitled in terms of acquired rights. As ordered and instructed by the union leaders, the workers refused to do so, causing significant prejudice to their own interests, since articles  and  of the Labour Code exclude the possibility of making any legal claims to employment rights two months after their agreements have been terminated.\n.The Government states that the trade union eventually acknowledged that the Institute s senior management had on the one hand dismissed staff and, on the other hand, recruited others. However, what the signatories of the agreement do not indicate is that many people lacking the proper qualifications for their posts were under contract at the Institute. As a result, it was necessary to replace part of them with qualified staff, social workers, psychologists and physicians to carry out the difficult work of the Institute, that is to say, to provide care for children at social risk or for juvenile offenders of criminal law.\n.The Government stresses that SITRAIHNFA has been responsible for constant abuse, causing prejudice not only to the Institute and the children. The union carried out  illegal work stoppages (amounting to ""]"

In this respect, the organization adds that: (i) SITIAMASH, established in , is the main trade union for sugar workers in the country and is an affiliate of the Single Federation of Workers of Honduras, the Single Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH) and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations; (ii) the merger respected all the internal processes of both organizations, as well as the respective administrative processes, as noted in Resolution No. / of  March  issued by the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments (STSS); (iii) under the merger, SITIAMASH and the group trade union agreed on the goal of  concluding collective agreements to ensure a decent and dignified life for sugar workers and fighting for the existence of only one collective agreement between workers and employers in the Honduran sugar industry'  and (iv) with the backing of the labour inspector and the legal representative responsible for the merger, the enterprise Azunosa (hereafter  the enterprise'  was informed of the merger in question, so that it could take the necessary steps, especially with regard to collective bargaining and the deduction of union dues in the enterprise.\n.The complainant organization goes on to indicate that, on  December , the group trade union notified the STSS of its unilateral separation from SITIAMASH. In this respect, the complainant organization states that: (i) at no time was SITIAMASH informed of this separation process, which is not provided for in the labour legislation; (ii) in violation of the labour legislation, the labour administration, through Resolution No. / of  December , immediately registered the separation without any administrative processes having been undertaken and without demanding the fulfilment of all the requirements and processes that had been put in place during the merger; and (iii) the labour administration proceeded to immediately recognize a new executive committee of the group trade union.\n.The complainant organization also alleges that: (i) the workers who opposed the separation were dismissed; (ii) the enterprise did not agree to receive a visit from the labour inspector following the complaint filed by SITIAMASH alleging the illegality of the separation and the dismissals; (iii) the enterprise never fulfilled its obligation to send SITIAMASH the union dues of unionized workers following the merger concluded on  March ; (iv) in this context, the President of SITIAMASH has been followed and his place of residence has been under surveillance; and (v) the lawyer appointed by SITIAMASH to undertake the administrative and legal action related to the trade union merger process and the aforementioned dismissals was the victim of an attack on  January  during which her car and place of residence were shot at several times, luckily she avoided physical injury.\n.In a communication dated  May , the CUTH provided additional information on the allegations presented by SITIAMASH. The CUTH stated specifically that: (i) the merger of the group trade union and SITIAMASH, officially registered by the labour administration on  March , resulted from a decision by the group trade union s general assembly on  August , which did not face any opposition from the enterprise or the labour administration at that time; (ii) as a result of the merger, the group trade union had become the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH; (iii) on  May , the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH presented the enterprise with a list of demands concerning all workers who performed their work on the enterprise s premises, including workers directly employed by the enterprise and those employed though third-party companies; (iv) as noted in several inspection reports, the enterprise refused to engage in the dialogue that was repeatedly requested by SITIAMASH; (v) in violation of the legislation, the labour administration refused to appoint a mediator, as had been requested by SITIAMASH; (vi) on  November , the enterprise, with the collusion of some workers occupying positions of trust and without seeking avenues for negotiation with SITIAMASH, established a parallel executive committee of the defunct group trade union, claiming that it had been appointed by the union s general assembly, although the union had already merged with SITIAMASH, in accordance with the wishes of that general assembly; (vii) subsequently, the new parallel executive committee, without the permission of the general assembly, initiated a separation process, without duly notifying SITIAMASH and unbeknownst to the members of its Guanchias branch; (viii) the enterprise negotiated five collective agreements with the aforementioned executive committee within three months, which were registered by the STSS as agreements with companies subcontracted by the enterprise; (ix) on  July , the enterprise dismissed Gustavo Alberto Quiroz Baquedano, Francisco Enrique Mendoza Canales, Rubn Daro Umanzor, Maynor Jos Ponce, Rony Alexis Cruz and Jos Magdaleno Bentez, all workers who were members of the executive committee of the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH; (x) almost two years after the filing of a complaint regarding the violation of the trade union rights of the aforementioned trade union leaders, they are still waiting for the penalties provided for in the Labour Inspection Act to be imposed; (xi) the members of the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH have been subject to coercion, threats of dismissal and offers of employment and economic benefits to leave their union and join the union orchestrated by the enterprise, and a permanent campaign of intimidation has been maintained with armed security guards stationed in the work areas in order to monitor and harass members of the Guanchias branch; and (xii) on  August , a request was filed with the STSS to oppose the registration of the aforementioned collective agreements on the grounds that the group trade union lacked legal representativeness and was a union sponsored by the employer.\n.In view of the above, the complainant alleges that: (i) since the group trade union was legally and duly merged with SITIAMASH, the election of a new executive committee of the defunct group trade union constitutes a mechanism for the creation of a parallel union, running counter to the interests of the workers as expressed in the assembly that authorized the merger of the unions; and (ii) the election of the executive committee of the trade union sponsored by the enterprise and parallel to the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH and the registration of collective agreements were illegal administrative acts because SITIAMASH was never summoned by either the group trade union or the STSS and the negotiation of the collective agreements was carried out in absence of the Guanchias branch of SITIAMASH.\n.In a communication dated  November , the CUTH alleges an escalation of the harassment, intimidation, threats and persecution against the senior members of the SITIAMASH branch present in the enterprise. The CUTH alleges in particular: (i) the unjustified dismissal on  October  of Carlos Rivera, Secretary-General of the branch of SITIAMASH in the enterprise; and (ii) threats of dismissal against the other workers of the enterprise who maintained their membership of SITIAMASH.\n.In a communication dated  November , the Government indicates that the State of Honduras respects Conventions Nos  and  and refrains from acts of interference of any kind into trade unions' activities. The Government specifically indicates that: (i) the STSS registered the merger of the group trade union and SITIAMASH through Resolution No. / of  March  and that the relevant information can be found in the archives of the General Labour Directorate in the Department of Civil Organizations; (ii) however, the archives of this office do not contain a record of the locations in which SITIAMASH has branches; (iii) there is no evidence in the General Labour Directorate of the withdrawal of the legal personality of the group trade union, and this legal personality therefore remains valid; (iv) on  November , Mr Montenegro Orellana appeared before the General Labour Directorate to notify it of the new executive committee of the group trade union; (v) as the public authorities must refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of the organizations to organize their administration, the General Labour Directorate took note of the"", "".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  August  from the Unitary Confederation of Workers of Honduras (CUTH), the Workers' Confederation of Honduras (CTH) and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT).\n.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In their communication dated  August , the CUTH, the CTH and the CGT raise objections to Decree No. - of  November, which contains the National Hourly Employment Programme (PRONEH), which they consider to be in violation of ILO Conventions Nos , , , ,  and  (the Committee will limit itself to examining the alleged violations of Conventions Nos  and ). The complainants add that agreement No. STSS-- was published on  January , and that it contains the regulations of PRONEH, issued by the Ministry, pursuant to the provisions of article  of Decree No.  , which requires the Ministry to work together with a member of the workers' organizations and a member of the employers' organizations, designated by the Economic and Social Council, to regulate the application of the abovementioned Decree within  days of its publication. The complainants state that no invitation was sent to the workers' organizations and allege that the Decree, which directly affects workers, was adopted without consultation by the Government with trade unions, and is intended not to promote employment but to further deregulate the labour market, increase job insecurity and violate international labour Conventions, the Constitution and the Labour Code. According to the complainants, the Temporary Hourly Employment Act was adopted in order to legalize temporary work and outsourcing. The complainants point out that the labour market is saturated with temporary workers and those doing outsourced work, and the Act is not needed to hire workers on a temporary basis (the complainants provided the figures for temporary workers in the private and public sectors).\n.The complainants state that, as Decree No. - and the corresponding regulations have been adopted without consultation, the workers' confederations are preparing an appeal against both documents on the grounds that they are unconstitutional and impossible to implement. The appeal is to be submitted to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. The complainants allege that workers' organizations were not consulted with regard to the adoption of the Decree and regulations, and only the employers' interests were taken into consideration. They add that the second paragraph of article  of the Decree, which states that  it is understood that workers hired under the terms of the Programme are entitled to the fundamental rights set forth in the Labour Code and the eight fundamental ILO Conventions signed and ratified by the State of Honduras, including Conventions Nos  and , which guarantee the right to organize and collective bargaining, in compliance with the provisions of domestic labour law'  is merely declaratory and perverse since the Decree turns professional activities of the permanent nature exercised by many workers into a temporary activity and, worse still, into hourly employment. They also consider that this paragraph is contradictory since it states that rights and guarantees must be compatible with domestic labour law yet domestic law denies temporary workers the right to organize.\n.The complainants consider that the principal violation lies in the attempt to use a decree to convert labour activities that are permanent per se into temporary hourly work, thereby increasing the number of workers who are denied the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. According to the complainants, the Decree contains no genuine and effective provisions on the exercise of the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and it makes trade union organization and collective bargaining impossible, in practice, for temporary workers, let alone workers hired by the hour or on a non-permanent basis. The complainants state that the option of hiring workers by the hour, and the concomitant job insecurity, can only have adverse effects on freedom of association and make it easier to commit acts of anti-union discrimination. In practice, most enterprises resort to temporary labour with no regulation and no guarantees of fundamental rights.\n.In its communication of  November , the Government states that, in their explanation of the violations, the trade union confederations state that they are preparing an appeal on grounds of unconstitutionality because they consider that the Constitution and Conventions Nos , , ,  and  are being violated. According to the allegations, Honduran workers would allegedly be left without protection as a result of the violation of their right to job security, greater job insecurity, and the loss of collective bargaining and trade union rights. However, to date, nobody has lodged an appeal against the National Hourly Employment Programme Act (Decree No. -), nor is there any record, in the Inspectorate, of any complaint relating to the violation of the labour rights of workers under the Programme.\n.As regards the alleged violation of job security, PRONEH rules out any possibility of violating this right, firstly because it prohibits the dismissal of permanent workers for the purpose of replacing them with workers hired under and covered by the Hourly Employment Programme, and secondly because employers will be allowed to hire temporary workers in numbers equal to  per cent of the workforce, but this percentage is calculated on the basis of the overall workforce of permanent staff, meaning that if a permanent staff member is dismissed, the number of permitted temporary employees will be reduced accordingly. With regard to the alleged violations of trade union and collective bargaining rights, it should be noted that article , paragraph , of Decree No. - stipulates that  it is understood that workers hired under the terms of the Programme are entitled to the fundamental rights set forth in the Labour Code and the eight fundamental ILO Conventions, including Conventions Nos  and , which guarantee the right to organize and collective bargaining, in compliance with the provisions of domestic law' \n.With regard to the allegation that workers' organizations were not consulted before PRONEH was adopted, the Government states that, before adopting the Act, the Honduran Congress held public information meetings for the sectors concerned, and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (STSS), acting through the Economic and Social Council, subsequently invited workers' and employers' representatives to draw up the Act s regulations, but only the employers' representatives attended. The Honduran Congress organized a series of meetings and awareness-raising events with the various sectors before adopting the Act (these facts have been checked against graphical records). During monitoring of the implementation of the Programme, concerned sectors have also been invited but the only persons who participated as observers on behalf of workers were Mr Alfredo Ponce and Mr Roberto Sevilla from the CTH. The aim was to monitor and check the Programme and determine whether or not it was necessary for the Programme s legal technical unit to propose changes to enhance the implementation of Decree No.  .\n.With regard to the allegation that PRONEH has failed to promote employment and that one of its purposes is to legalize temporary work, the Government states that PRONEH was devised within the framework of the Government s plan for '  as a temporary strategic programme for reducing and eradicating poverty. Its main objectives include increasing work opportunities and thereby enable the people to live with dignity, preserve existing jobs and avert an increase in the rates of unemployment and underemployment. It is not the purpose of the Programme to legalize temporary work. Indeed, article , points  and , read as follows : ' ) production or service units shall not hire workers under the terms of the Programme to perform duties considered, in accordance with the Labour Code, to be temporary or seasonal'  for the simple reason that those workers are regulated and protected by the Labour Code (article  of the Labour Code); ' ) production or service units performing duties that may be specific to their trade but are not ongoing because they are dependent on production contracts involving predetermined volumes with specific due dates for occasional customers, meaning that when the delivery is made or the due date is reached the work to be done comes to an end, as well as those tasks that increase seasonally or during certain periods of the year or at certain dates and thus require a temporary increase in the workforce, may avail themselves of the Programme and hire employees under the terms thereof'  this provision makes it possible for employers to create jobs by hiring staff to meet seasonal demand. Staff hired under the hourly employment regime have the advantage of benefiting from all labour benefits, such as the guaranteed payment of thirteenth and fourteenth months' wages and leave for each hour worked, paid for in the form of non-routine compensation,"", '.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  January  from Education International (EI) and the Teachers\' Union of the Autonomous National University of Honduras (SIDUNAH).\n.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In their communication dated  January , EI and SIDUNAH allege that: (i) the Autonomous National University of Honduras (UNAH), an autonomous state institution, refuses to recognize the legal existence of SIDUNAH for the purposes of representing all the teaching staff who work at UNAH; and (ii) refuses to transfer to it the sums of money corresponding to the union dues deducted from all teaching staff. The complainants report that: (i) SIDUNAH was established in  and its recognition by the Secretary of State in the Department of Labour and Social Security was published on  January ; and (ii) on  April  a request was submitted to UNAH for it to transfer the union dues to SIDUNAH from that point on, a request that was allegedly denied by UNAH.\n.The complainants note that, in light of the refusal of the university authorities to recognize SIDUNAH as a trade union and to transfer to it the funds corresponding to the union dues deducted from the university teachers, SIDUNAH lodged an appeal for amparo (remedy for the protection of constitutional rights) with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and that, by means of a ruling dated  July , the Court ordered UNAH to recognize SIDUNAH and to transfer to it the union dues deducted from the teachers since April .\n.The complainants allege that the university authorities did not comply with this sentence and they therefore requested that an executing officer be appointed, in accordance with articles  and  of the Constitutional Justice Act, a request that was granted and the Supreme Court appointed an executing officer and a court order was obtained for the seizure of the funds relating to the period from April  to  October  from the Central Bank of Honduras. The complainants note that they are requesting the same procedure for the seizure of the funds corresponding to the union dues from  November  to  December , although that request is allegedly being stalled by the Central Bank, which appears to be conspiring with the university authorities and the other trade union involved.\n.In a communication dated  July , the Government noted that on  April , SIDUNAH submitted a document to UNAH stating that it had legal recognition and requested that the deductions of union dues, from the teachers who work at that institution, be transferred to it (request logged as administrative file No. SG-UEA---). The Government notes that by means of documents dated  and  April , the rector s office of UNAH requested SIDUNAH to correct a number of deficiencies and, in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Labour Code, to, among other things, provide accreditation for the teachers by means of their respective original signed membership applications, along with a copy that can be duly checked, as well as a certified extract of the records of the meeting held by the members of SIDUNAH, in which, by majority vote, they request UNAH to take a deduction from the wages of the affiliated workers and to make available to the union the ordinary and extraordinary dues that they are required to contribute.\n.The Government notes that, even though on  July , SIDUNAH partially corrected the things that had been requested of it, it did not comply with the aforementioned, therefore, on  October , UNAH decided to shelve the proceedings. The Government also notes that: (i) on  October , SIDUNAH appealed that ruling and requested that it be declared partially void; (ii) on  November , SIDUNAH requested the rector\'s office of UNAH to send certification that it had given implied consent (article  of the Administrative Proceedings Act, which provides that: ""The silence of the Administration shall have the effect of a declaration of presumed intent, only in such cases in which the Act gives it a positive or negative effect""); (iii) on  November , the rector\'s office decided that it should refer back to what had been decided on  October (that is, to shelve the proceedings); (iv) on  November , SIDUNAH submitted a document entitled ""Document certifying that implied consent has been given in its favour"" (which was received by the secretariat of the University Council on  December ); and (v) on  July , the Legal Department issued a report on the matter.\n.The Government notes that on  March , SIDUNAH lodged an appeal for amparo (remedy for the protection of constitutional rights) before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and that on  July , the Court issued its ruling granting amparo having considered that implied consent had been given and ""that, having detected an infringement of the right to petition, of the right to defence and, as a result, to due process, the teachers belonging to SIDUNAH were granted amparo, in order that their right to due administrative process be restored to them, providing them with the certification of implied consent, because it had been proven that there had been no response for more than two years, which gave rise to the legal effect of a positive reply to the request"". The Government notes that the Court ordered UNAH to recognize SIDUNAH and its board of directors and to proceed with the transfer of the sums of money corresponding to the deductions for ordinary and extraordinary union dues from April  until the date of the ruling.\n.According to the Government, in compliance with this ruling, on  January , the rector s office of UNAH ordered the recognition of SIDUNAH and ordered the general secretariat to request SIDUNAH to submit union membership rolls, which should be accompanied by a signed authorization and the fingerprint, employee number and identity number of each member, for the purposes of the salary deductions. The executive secretariat for staff development was also ordered to implement the deductions for SIDUNAH members, in accordance with the lists submitted.\n.The Government indicates that: (i) SIDUNAH believed that the sentence had not been wholly complied with and requested the Constitutional Chamber to appoint an executing officer to ensure that the sentence was carried out; and (ii) the Court appointed an executing officer, without overseeing their work or defining the procedures to follow for accomplishing their mandate (article  of the Constitutional Justice Act) and that, in view of such an omission by the Court, UNAH was subjected to serious and irreparable damages as a result of the arbitrary and discretionary actions taken liberally by the executing officer who, going beyond the scope of the ruling, illegally requested that the executive board of SIDUNAH join the governing body of UNAH, that the executive board of SIDUNAH be relieved of their academic duties, that physical spaces be assigned to the union, that the total number of teaching staff at UNAH be determined, and required payment and seized UNAH property in the amount of  million lempiras, which corresponds to the period from April  to December  (and not to July , as per the ruling), making arbitrary use of the list of all teachers at UNAH, ignoring the fact that not all of them are members of SIDUNAH, and as a result the ruling that they were instructed to carry out did not cover all of them. The Government notes that the funds were seized from the UNAH budget intended for the execution of its constitutional mandate to further higher education in the country, and not that corresponding to the union dues deducted from the salaries of teachers who are members of SIDUNAH.\n.The Government notes that on  June , UNAH requested that the Court completely void the proceedings since the ruling appointing the executing officer and all of their actions, for having violated due process and having omitted to define the proceedings as laid down in article  of the Constitutional Justice Act, and due to the excesses of the executing officer in carrying out their mandate. The Government notes that UNAH has proposed that the declaration that implied consent had been given does not in itself give automatic authorization to what SIDUNAH had requested, since it is still necessary to comply with the requirements of the relevant norms, in this case, those contained in article  of the Labour Code. The Government notes that UNAH had not taken deductions from members of SIDUNAH, since they had not been accredited and had not submitted union membership rolls or the duly signed authorizations, accompanied by the fingerprints, employee number and identity number of every member of SIDUNAH for the purpose of the deduction from']"
