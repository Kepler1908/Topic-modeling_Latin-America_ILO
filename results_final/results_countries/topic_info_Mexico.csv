The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n.In a communication dated  June , IndustriALL Global Union (hereinafter IndustriALL, previously the International Metalworkers' Federation), one of the complainants, submitted additional information in which it alleges that: (i) consultation and social dialogue meetings were not held with all the complainants ' the Government merely held bilateral meetings with some of the parties ' and the matter of protection agreements and possible solutions to the problem were only discussed superficially; these were primarily meetings held between the Government and the National Union of Workers (UNT), which sought to resolve specific problems and not the underlying problem of protection agreements; (ii) the complainants were not informed about ILO technical assistance to review and adjust the labour law reform; (iii) the use of arbitrary and physical violence against workers fighting to exercise their rights to freedom of association continues; and (iv) in practice no concrete measures have been forthcoming to eliminate the widespread system of protection agreements, and new employer protection agreements are still being signed in all sectors.\n.In the same communication, IndustriALL provides information on specific cases involving the use of protection agreements:(a)\tHonda Mexico United Workers' Union (STUHM). IndustriALL recalls that an initial protection agreement was signed between the company and the Union of Workers in the Vehicle Manufacturing and Assembly Industry (SETEAMI) before the start-up of operations; that, prior to this situation, workers formed a union in the El Salto, Jalisco, plant, establishing the STUHM in May ; and that, despite delays in proceedings, calls to cancel the union s registration and threats by the protection union, the STUHM proceeded with its legal action to seek title to the collective agreement. IndustriALL alleges that: (i) on  October , the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board (Junta Federal de Conciliacin y Arbitraje) ordered a vote recount in the company, but that this exercise had been plagued by irregularities ' the voter list contained irregularities, admittance to the premises was denied to the team of national and international observers, union representatives and workers were threatened, voters were isolated from the rest of the plant and surrounded by security staff; (ii) although the STUHM reported these facts to the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board, the latter twice issued decisions disregarding the irregularities; and (iii) a conflict of interest arose in that the same person acted both as the SETEAMI representative and as coordinator for the advisers to the President of the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board during the legal action to seek title to the collective agreement.(b)\tCommercial, Office, Retail, Similar and Allied Workers' Union (STRACC). IndustriALL alleges that: (i) petrol station workers in Mexico City subject to protection agreements receive no wages, are not covered by social security or entitled to benefits, and are required to pay fees to their employers to be allowed to work in the petrol stations in exchange for tips received from customers; (ii) in workplaces where the STRACC has gained title to the collective agreement, the situation has changed. However, in two of the petrol stations where the STRACC is titleholder of the collective agreement, the workers have been subjected to threats by company representatives and members of the protection union; (iii) several workers from different petrol stations have approached the STRACC to seek protection. The companies are reportedly obliging workers to resign from the union, hiring new staff who are unpaid and receive no social benefits, and signing them up to the protection union through third-party companies; (iv) STRACC union officials, representatives and members have been threatened, beaten, kidnapped and illegally detained on false accusations by the employers in collusion with the local and Federal Government; and (v) they point out that in the legal action to seek title to the collective agreement initiated on  June  by the STRACC against the Union of Employers and Workers in the Federal District General Trade Sector and the company Super Servicio Coapa, the vote recount did not take place until  August , due to a series of irregularities, and that the process has not yet been completed, with the STRACC consequently fearing that once the legal action is concluded the petrol station will be left with no unionized workers.(c)\tNational Union of Petroleum Technicians and Professionals (UNTyPP). IndustriAll alleges that: (i) Petrleos Mexicanos (hereinafter the oil company) signed a protection agreement with the Petroleum Workers Union of Mexico (STPRM); (ii) the abuses and illegal acts in which the Government has been involved, to the detriment of the oil company workers and workers hired by third-party companies, have been denounced on numerous occasions; (iii) a recent example is the accident that occurred on  April  at the Pajaritos plant, in Veracruz state, which was formerly owned by the oil company and is currently owned by another company. More than  workers died in the accident and others were injured because of the lack of safety measures, training and equipment and the absence of a trade union organization to monitor compliance with the law in that area ' the UNTyPP noted that in this particular case the employer company could not be identified due to the triangulation of labour relations; and (iv) similar cases are reportedly arising throughout the oil and electricity sectors, where protection unions are said to be removing social and financial protections.\n.IndustriALL further alleges that the Government has encouraged protection agreements and that this is evidenced by the signing and deposit of new protection agreements in car manufacturing companies before hiring workers or constructing the plant. In this regard, IndustriALL alleges that: (i) in July , BMW (hereinafter the first car manufacturer) announced the creation of its new plant in San Luis Potos, which will begin operations in . Also in July  (when the new plant was still at the project stage), a protection agreement signed by the Mexican National Automotive Industry, Similar and Allied Workers' Union was deposited with the office of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security ' IndustriALL emphasizes that the Secretary-General of the union in question had reportedly concluded  similar collective agreements and claimed to be negotiating an agreement to cover the workers of the Goodyear tyre factory, whose construction had scarcely begun; and (ii) in August , the KIA motor company (hereinafter the second car manufacturer) announced the construction of a car production plant in Nuevo Len. Again in August, the protection agreement that reportedly applies in the plant, signed by the Mexican National Automotive Industry, Similar and Allied Workers' Union, was deposited. Moreover, IndustriALL alleges that statements made by the Government in international forums to the effect that strikes have not taken place in Mexico for over two years are false and are indicative of attempts to eliminate independent unions.\n.In communications dated  November  and  February , the Government provided information as part of the follow-up to the Committee s recommendations. The Government states that: (i) in preparation for the technical assistance agreement with the ILO, on  October , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security requested in writing the opinions of the main workers' and employers' organizations, although only the Revolutionary Confederation of Workers and Peasants (CROC) sent its observations; (ii) the Minister of Labour and Social Security met with the Secretary-General of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) twice ' on one occasion the latter was accompanied by the Assistant Secretary-General of IndustriaALL Global Union and the Secretary-General of the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of the Americas (CSA). During these meetings, discussions took place on the importance of mediation and conciliation, the requirement for conciliation and arbitration boards to make collective agreements public, the employer s obligation to disseminate collective agreements in their entirety, the removal of the  exclusion clause' and the ratification of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). The Government further states that: (i) in February , the National Conference of Labour Ministers (CONASETRA) was created and, at their meeting in February , those responsible for labour policy in the states and in the federation committed themselves to promoting a national agenda on labour justice, with a view to increasing the use of technologies to facilitate the transparency of processes, promoting reforms on procedural fraud, reviewing working conditions and staff training at national level, discussing the construction of a national IT platform and strengthening tripartism; (ii) in , during the National Conference of Conciliation and Arbitration Boards (CONAJUNTAS), a permanent forum where labour courts explore, define and adopt agreements, the conciliation and arbitration boards committed themselves to joining the process to discuss, analyse and define actions for the thorough review of the labour justice system; (iii) the Federal Conciliation"", "".The Committee last examined the substance of this case at its June  meeting [see nd Report, para. ]. On that occasion, the Committee indicated that it would proceed with the examination of this case in relation to the specific allegations of violations of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining arising from protection agreements and to the issues concerning anti-union discrimination. The Committee requested the Government to provide all supplementary and relevant up-to-date information on the various allegations made by IndustriALL of specific situations involving the use of protection agreements, so that the Committee would have access to all relevant information when it next examined the follow-up of the case. In addition, the Committee referred the legislative aspects of the case on the application of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n.In its communication of  February , the Government sent information regarding the follow-up given to the Committee s recommendations in relation to the specific situations raised by IndustriALL in its previous communications:(a)\tHonda Mexico United Workers' Union (STUHM): the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board (JFCA) heard the case related to the title to the collective agreement filed by the STUHM, carrying out in due time and form each step of the procedure established in legislation: (i) the vote recount was conducted on  October  in the best possible conditions, without any duly substantiated or validated objections and in the presence of three JFCA certifying officers, the Secretary-General for Agreements, Conciliation and Collective Issues, two federal labour inspectors, eight observers representing foreign trade unions, the secretaries general and representatives of the unions and representatives of the company; (ii) the recount was carried out in accordance with the law in a peaceful and orderly manner, and of the , workers present,  voted for STUHM and , for the defendant trade union; (iii) when it discovered that the recount was not in its favour, the STUHM filed direct amparo proceedings with the first district labour court of the federal district, which were dismissed, confirming that the JFCA had acted in strict compliance with the law; and (iv) regarding the alleged existence of a presumed conflict of interest on the part of the individual who acted as coordinator for the advisers to the President of the JFCA, the board advised on  May  that the individual in question did not perform that public function and there was therefore no conflict of interest.(b)\tCommercial, Office, Retail, Similar and Allied Workers' Union (STRACC): (i) on  March , STRACC was granted the title to the collective agreement; and (ii) the parties who had been sued by STRACC lodged appeals for amparo (Nos DT /, DT / and DT /), which were unsuccessful and therefore did not adversely affect the STRACC.(c)\tNational Union of Petroleum Technicians and Professionals (UNTyPP): (i) since  March , Petrleos Mexicanos (PEMEX, hereinafter the oil company) and the UNTyPP have held more than  meetings in which issues raised by the UNTyPP have been addressed, including the dismissal of workers ' agreeing to discuss the possibility of rehiring those worker members of the UNTyPP who were affected by the aforementioned movements; (ii) this case was analysed as part of the round table discussions held since  by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (STPS) with the National Union of Workers ' the STPS has facilitated meetings between the UNTyPP and the management of the company in which employment files were analysed, leading to the reinstatement and retirement of several UNTyPP members, in the interest of mediating a settlement to the disputes, on  July  the Deputy Minister for Labour addressed a communication to the chief executive officer of the company voicing the UNTyPP s concerns regarding the new collective labour agreement; (iii) there is a collective labour agreement between the company and the Petroleum Workers Union of Mexico (STPRM), which was last revised on  July  and is valid until  July .(d)\tWith regard to the BMW plant (hereinafter the first car manufacturer) located in San Luis Potos: (i) on  July , a collective labour agreement was presented to the JFCA between the company and the Mexican National Automotive Industry, Similar and the Allied Workers' Union of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM); (ii) the labour authority verified the legitimacy of the Union to assemble automotive industry workers and that the contractual agreement complied with the requirements set out in section  of the Federal Labour Act, the collective labour agreement was consequently registered; and (iii) on  November , under the protocol on free collective bargaining, an extraordinary inspection was carried out at the company s San Luis Potos plant during which it was found that  workers ( men and  women) worked in the workplace, those workers knew the representative of the union of which they were a member, were aware of the collective labour agreement that applied to them and had access to it (both in the workplace and online); in that respect, it was confirmed that the company had hard copies of the collective agreement governing labour relations that were provided to workers and were made available in freely accessible spaces.(e)\tWith regard to the KIA Motors Corporation plant (hereinafter the second car manufacturer) in Nuevo Len: (i) on  August , a collective labour agreement was presented to the JFCA between the company and the Mexican National Automotive Industry, Similar and Allied Workers' Union; (ii) the labour authority verified the legitimacy of the Union to assemble automotive industry workers and that the contractual agreement complied with the requirements set out in section  of the Federal Labour Act, and, having fulfilled the jurisdiction and legal requirements and those for the right to represent others, the agreement was registered; and (iii) on  November , under the protocol on free collective bargaining, an extraordinary inspection was carried out of the general working conditions in the company, which verified the existence of , workers (, men and  women), registered with the Mexican Social Security Institute, the existence of a collective labour agreement duly registered with the labour authority, and it was confirmed that the workers knew the name of the union of which they were members and the content of the collective labour agreement applicable to them and had access to it (copies were distributed to workers and kept available in freely accessible spaces).\n.Based on the information above, the Government considers that these cases prove that state institutions function adequately and give due attention to the claims of the unions concerned. Furthermore, it recalls that new efforts have been undertaken to make the work of the labour authorities more efficient and timely and to consolidate the prompt and unimpeded administration of labour justice, including through national coordination mechanisms to improve the pursuit and administration of day-to-day justice in Mexico and the recent update to the labour regulations framework by means of the  constitutional reform on labour justice administration.\n.In communications dated  and  July , IndustriALL provides its observations and further information regarding the follow-up of the case. IndustriALL reports that, despite the reforms and other measures announced by the Government, the practice of employer protection agreements is continuing and expanding, as evidenced by the specific situations it presents in relation to the complaint. As a reminder, IndustriALL condemns the system under which such protection agreements reportedly continue to operate, emphasizing that: (i) the agreements are a clear result of cooperation between the Government (which would approve employer protection agreements in return for political favours ' while acting as employer, judge and litigant in the authorities responsible for administering justice), corporate federations (which are deeply embedded in political and economic decision making bodies) and certain companies (which maintain lower operating costs and control over their workforce as these agreements protect the employer from having to negotiate with genuine unions), thus preventing workers from exercising their right to freedom of association; (ii) the protection union that will administer the collective agreement is selected before the employer even begins operations; and (iii) if workers try to organize themselves, the authorities, employers and corporate federations work together to ensure they are not successful, using methods which range from postponing proceedings to dismissals and all types of threats and assaults. In addition, it challenges the effectiveness and authenticity of the measures announced by the Government to combat this deep-rooted practice, alleging that these changes are designed to allow the situation to remain unchanged, emphasizing that: (i) union information and collective agreements are not published or available, as reported by the Government; (ii) proceedings continue to last for an average of five years; (iii) meetings with Mexican unions in relation to the complaint did not address the issue of protection unions; (iv) while the constitutional reform is presented as a panacea, in reality it is an illusion, as demonstrated by the bill formulated"", ""to implement the reform, which was presented by senators who are members of corporate federations and therefore reproduces the system of collective protection agreements; and (v) the  protocol on free collective bargaining is no more than a sham as: the inspection dates are decided in advance with the company; the workers questioned during the inspection are selected by the trade union representative and/or the employer (questions simply regarding whether the worker in question is aware of their union and its statutes, whether he or she is aware of the collective agreement and whether the agreement is accessible to workers, in a clear location in the workplace). IndustriALL considers that if a collective employer protection agreement is in place in that workplace (as, according to the complainant, is the case for  per cent of workplaces) the replies are controlled by the protection union, rendering the protocol useless. In addition, in order to demonstrate the deficiencies of the public mechanisms, IndustriALL reports that, in response to the impunity and passivity of the labour authorities, a committee of civil society organizations has been established in the textile industry that includes  international brands and which carried out a  Campaign for freedom of association in Mexico' with the objective of  challenging the use of protection agreements in their supply chains'  These brands have worked on their own initiative to implement independent monitoring and audits to verify the compliance of their internal codes of conduct with the ILO fundamental Conventions, in particular to address the issue of protection agreements and ensure that the supplier companies with which they have production contracts understand and respect the right to freedom of association. In several cases these private initiatives have managed to resolve serious issues related to rights, dismissals and harassment in factories where protection unions operated.\n.In addition, IndustriALL provides further information regarding specific situations highlighted in the Committee s previous examination of the complaint and on new cases. With respect to previously presented cases, on which the Government has provided its observations, the complainant indicates that:(a)\tRegarding the STUHM, challenging the Government s report, it emphasizes that: (i) the JFCA ordered the recount within the company and without reliable documentation on the voter register; (ii) during the recount entry was denied to the team of national and international observers and STUHM representatives (union representatives were threatened with firearms by the plant s security personnel when they demanded to be granted entry and they were only permitted to enter following heated arguments and complaints); (iii) throughout the whole procedure inside the plant representatives of the union in question, the Union of Employees and Workers in the Vehicle Manufacturing and Assembly Industry (SETEAMI), and the company continuously threatened the workers with dismissal if they lost the recount; (iv) the list of voters contained persons who should not have voted and company personnel selected those who could access the voting area, which was isolated from the rest of the plant and surrounded by internal security personnel; and (v) the irregularities were reported by the STUHM but they were not addressed by JFCA officials; (vi) the SETEAMI legal representative acted as the representative of the SETEAMI (of the CTM) during the trial before the JFCA and as the coordinator for the advisers of the president of that board, when the STUHM reported this conflict of interest, the individual ceased to represent SETEAMI, but reassumed that role in June ; (vii) despite all of the aforementioned irregularities in the recount, the STUHM received  per cent of the vote; however, the company refused to grant it the facilities to represent its members, including entry into the plant, office space to meet with members, recognition of its representative and the deduction of trade union dues, and (viii) the executive board of the STUHM remains dismissed and its request for reinstatement is in process.(b)\tRegarding the STRACC: (i) in several stations where it is the titleholder of the collective agreement, employer representatives and protection unions threaten workers in order to coerce them into resigning with a view to hiring new personnel from third party companies; (ii) STRACC leaders, members and representatives have been threatened, attacked, kidnapped and illegally imprisoned as a result of false accusations from employers in collusion with the local and federal Government, in this context, organizing in a union poses a risk for the personal safety of workers and their families; (iii) in the legal action to seek title initiated on  June  by the STRACC against the Union of Employers and Workers in the Federal District General Trade Sector and the company, the recount was not held until  August , owing to a series of irregularities instigated by the company, the protection union and the Local Conciliation and Arbitration Board (JLCA) of the federal district; (iv) it was not until March  that, after repeated appeals lodged by the company, the STRACC was recognized as the titleholder for this workplace, but in the meantime the majority of workers who had expressed a preference for the STRACC as their trade union had been dismissed and the company is currently dismissing more workers in order to hire new employees through a third party company which operates its own collective protection agreements; (v) in June  in the La Laguna petrol station, after STRACC had obtained the title to the collective labour agreement and had attained various related achievements, first the company threatened the Secretary-General to coerce him into cancelling the collective agreement and subsequently the Secretary-General of a trade union of a federation considered to be corporate contacted him asking how much money he wanted for the collective agreement, an offer which the STRACC representative declined; then armed thugs from the federation concerned hired by the company appeared during each shift change, attempted to oust workers and STRACC members using threats and demanded that they resigned from their jobs and the trade union ' the STRACC issued a call to strike to the company to protect its members, which is pending before the JLCA.(c)\tRegarding the UNTyPP: (i) the oil company held several meetings with the UNTyPP in  and  that did not resolve the key issues such as union representation, the refusal to engage in collective bargaining, open and aggressive interference in trade union operations and the refusal to reinstate those dismissed; (ii) the small number of meetings that have taken place with the company have been held on the insistence of the UNTyPP and the replies were sent electronically to avoid a record being kept of the meetings or of the recognition of the trade union; when the issues were addressed it was by low level officials who did not resolve the conflicts; and (iii) various meetings were held with the STPS which failed to respond to the complaints of the UNTyPP, and the union has not been granted a meeting with the company for about two years, despite its requests.(d)\tRegarding the first car manufacturer: (i) in July  it announced its new plant in San Luis Potos which would begin operations in  and, in the same month, it concluded a collective employer protection agreement signed by the Secretary-General of the Mexican National Automotive Industry, Similar and Allied Workers' Union of the CTM; this agreement was therefore concluded five years before operations were due to begin at the plant and before workers were hired; (ii) the Secretary-General who signed the agreement had concluded  other collective agreements in San Luis Potos with automobile and spare parts plants ' although the STPS website indicates that the union concerned has only  members ' and that same individual is also the Secretary General of the Federation of Workers of the State of San Luis Potos, which has  member unions covering all industrial sectors; (iii) in , as planned, the company was yet to begin operations and had only indicated that it was in the process of training workers provided by the CTM; (iv) however, on the STPS website it appears that the employee section of the collective agreement was revised on  March , indicating that it was applicable to  active workers at that time ' the number of members of the protection union covered by the protection agreement does not coincide with the number of workers indicated by the Government following a supposed labour inspection nor with the number of workers () indicated on its tax return; and (v) the plant is supposed to open in April  and it plans to employ , direct workers and around , more  indirect workers' throughout its supply chains ' supposedly all these workers will automatically become members of the aforementioned protection union, covered by a collective protection agreement in the development of which they did not participate and were not consulted.(e)\tRegarding the second car manufacturer: (i) in August  it announced the construction of the plant, which would begin operations in the first half of  and, like the first car manufacturer, at the""]"
