0,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Authentic Federation of Workers (FAT) received on  February .
.The Government of Panama sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  September .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication received on  February , the FAT indicates that on  February , the Industrial Union of Hotel Workers and Related Activities (SITEHOSTAC), which is affiliated with the FAT, submitted a list of claims to the Directorate-General for Labour (DGT) in the Ministry of Labour and Social Development (MITRADEL) with a view to resolving a number of labour violations as well as negotiating a collective labour agreement with HARTIN TRADING S.A. (HOTEL SORTIS) (hereinafter  the enterprise' . The complainant alleges that the enterprise refused to discuss the aforementioned list and that, after exhausting all terms established by law regarding the conciliation process and subsequent negotiation, SITEHOSTAC requested arbitration in view of the constant refusal of the enterprise and the fact that it had not put forward any proposal throughout the process. The complainant states that SITEHOSTAC requested arbitration in order to resolve the conflict, as permitted under section  of the Labour Code, and that the enterprise responded by submitting an application for amparo [protection of constitutional guarantees] to the Supreme Court of Justice in order to avoid, or at least delay or prevent, the collective bargaining that it is obliged to undertake under section  of the Labour Code.
.The complainant further indicates that SITEHOSTAC provided a list of trade union members to the enterprise and requested it to deduct the union dues established in its statutes, as set out in section  of the Labour Code. The complainant alleges that the enterprise refuses to deduct union dues from the salaries of trade union members and has not handed over the said dues to the trade union, thereby committing an unfair labour practice as described in section , paragraph , of the Labour Code, by making an omission designed to influence workers in the enterprise to withdraw from or not join the trade union and to violate freedom of association.
.In addition, the complainant alleges that the enterprise does not allow trade union leaders to have direct contact with the workers, by not authorizing the paid or unpaid leave necessary for them to do so. It is alleged that this occurred with Mr Luis Hendricks, Mr Arqumedes Rodrguez and Mr Samy Ros, demonstrating that the enterprise is interfering in trade union activity and preventing them from exercising their right of assembly and organization. The complainant indicates that in , the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found against Panama for impeding, among other things, the right of assembly of trade unionists (Baena-Ricardo et al. v. Panama).
.The complainant further alleges that the enterprise relocated workers affiliated with the union in an arbitrary manner and posted them to remote areas, lacking facilities such as sanitation, thereby discriminating against them for being trade union members. Moreover, the complainant alleges that since MITRADEL carried out an inspection of the enterprise in September , which culminated in the enterprise being fined for employing undocumented foreign workers, the enterprise, which attributed the request for the said inspection to the union, changed the working hours of unionized workers and union leaders, forcing them to work shifts from  p.m. to  a.m. to avoid contact with other workers. The complainant alleges that the enterprise punishes union members in an arbitrary and reckless manner by forcing them to work dawn shifts once they join the union, thus undermining the quality of family life and preventing trade union work in the case of union leaders.
.The complainant further alleges that the enterprise denied workers and union leaders Mr Luis Hendricks, Mr Arqumedes Rodrguez and Mr Benjamn Villanero access to work from  September  until they were reinstated by order of the DGT contained in Order No. -DGT- of  September , with which the enterprise has not fully complied to date since it has not paid the workers for the days on which they were denied access. The complainant indicates that although at the time of their reinstatement, by order of MITRADEL, the enterprise indicated that it had never dismissed them, the reports of the inspections that were carried out show that they were indeed denied access to the enterprise, being told, in an express statement of verbal dismissal, that they could not enter in order to work because they were  personae non gratae in the enterprise' 
.The complainant also alleges that the enterprise forces union members by means of threats, coercion, blackmail and any other means to withdraw from the union and that it has dismissed workers merely for belonging to the union. It alleges specifically that the enterprise threatened or forced Mr Jonny Lasso, Mr Kevin Snchez and Mr Ariel Gmez to withdraw from the union. The complainant additionally alleges that in recent months, the enterprise has dismissed workers affiliated with the union, who have been called on to accept and sign a mutual agreement terminating the employment relationship and, if they did not do so, were threatened with a letter of dismissal, all with the intention of weakening the union and to obtain control over the workers. It is alleged that this serious situation occurred with Mr Roger Almengor and Mr Francisco Banda.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government provides information concerning the various administrative and judicial actions relating to the issues raised in the complaint.
.The Government attached a copy of Note No. -DGT- in which the DGT within MITRADEL indicates that in the records and archives of the DGT there is a list of claims submitted by SITEHOSTAC on  February  for the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement and relating to violations of the labour laws by the enterprise under the following sections of the Labour Code: , , , , () and (), , () and () (alleging that the enterprise forces workers, by coercion or by any other means, to withdraw from, or constrains them from joining, the union), , , , , , , , , ,  and  (arbitrary change of shifts). In the Note, the DGT indicates that the dispute ended with the issuance of an arbitration award, of which SITEHOSTAC was notified on  December  and the enterprise on  January . In the same Note, the DGT also indicates that SITEHOSTAC made no claim, complaint or allegation against the enterprise for violation of articles () and () of the Labour Code concerning deductions of union dues of SITEHOSTAC members.
.The Government gives the following account of the events that led to the aforementioned arbitration award:
.The Government further indicates that various allegations have been submitted to the National Directorate of Labour Inspection and that on  September , a general inspection was conducted by SITEHOSTAC in order to verify an allegation relating to: (i) workplace harassment and anti-union persecution of workers Mr Benjamn Villanero, Mr Luis Hendricks and Mr Rodrigo Mndez; (ii) gratuity payments of all departments; (iii) the number of foreign workers and their permits; (iv) whether recent dismissals, such as that of Mr Francisco Banda, were justified; and (v) whether workers were given rest breaks between rotating shifts.
.The Government reports that after having conducted the aforementioned inspection it was decided, as indicated in Decision No. -DGT-- of  March , to impose a penalty of  Panamanian balboas (equivalent to US$) on the enterprise for having violated Act No.  of  concerning measures to prevent, prohibit and punish discriminatory acts. In addition, after verifying whether the foreign workers in the enterprise had work permits, it was decided, by Decision No. -DGT-- of September , to impose a fine of , balboas on the enterprise for non-compliance with section  of the Labour Code.
.With regard to the allegation that the enterprise denied Mr Roger Almengor, Mr Luis Hendricks, Mr Arqumedes Rodrguez and others access to work, the Government indicates that: (i) on  September , the National Directorate of Labour Inspection attended the enterprise in order to ascertain the aforementioned events and, by Orders Nos -DGT- and -DGT-- of  September , the DGT ordered that Mr Arqumedes Rodrguez and Mr Luis Hendricks be reinstated; (ii) the workers' representative filed a complaint for contempt of the aforementioned Orders by the enterprise and sought verification, inter alia, as to whether both had been reinstated and whether they had been paid wages for the days on which they had been denied access to the enterprise; (iii) on  September , the day of execution of the reinstatement order, the Chief of the Human Resources Department said that the workers could not be reinstated because neither one had been dismissed; (iv) by Order No. -DGT-- dated  January , the DGT dismissed the application for a fine for contempt",0,2020,Panama
1,"against the enterprise filed by the workers' representative, who submitted an appeal against the order, which remains pending; and (v) on  February  the DGT admitted an application for a fine for violation of labour standards and granted the enterprise a period of three days to submit evidence and arguments that it deemed appropriate, which remains pending.
.By a communication dated  September , the Government informs the Committee that the records and files of the DGT contain a list of claims concerning violations of labour legislation by the enterprise that was submitted by SITEHOSTAC on  October . The Government indicates that the enterprise was notified of the list on  December , that the conciliation process began on  December , that according to the minutes of the mediation session held on  January  the parties stated that they had engaged in dialogue and reached an agreement on the complaints contained in the list, and that consequently negotiations on the list had ended.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant alleges that a series of anti-union acts have been committed by a hotel enterprise against leaders and members of SITEHOSTAC. The complainant specifically alleges that the enterprise does not deduct union dues, does not grant union leave, arbitrarily relocates union members and threatens them so that they withdraw from the union, denied three union leaders access to work and dismissed two union members and that it has refused to negotiate a collective agreement. In its reply, the Government provides information on various actions taken principally by the DGT in relation to a number of the issues raised in the complaint and on penalties imposed on the enterprise in this regard.
.In relation to the allegation that the enterprise refused to negotiate with SITEHOSTAC a list of claims that it submitted on  February  to the DGT in order to resolve a number of labour violations and to negotiate a collective agreement, the Committee notes the Government s indication that: (i) after several appeals submitted by the enterprise and a strike notice by the union, the dispute was referred to arbitration; and (ii) the arbitration process concluded with the issuance of an arbitration award whereby the collective agreement for the period '  was registered. The Committee therefore understands, on the basis of the information provided by the Government, that the issue relating to the list of claims submitted by SITEHOSTAC in  appears to have been resolved. The Committee also notes that, according to the information provided by the Government, SITEHOSTAC submitted a further list of claims on  October  concerning violations of labour legislation by the enterprise and that in a mediation session on  January  the parties reached an agreement in this connection. The Committee observes that that list of claims was not for the purposes of negotiating a collective agreement and that it is not apparent from the information provided that the violations of labour law were in relation to trade union matters.
.With regard to the allegation that the enterprise does not deduct union dues, while it notes the Government s indication that the DGT has no record of any allegation in this regard, the Committee observes that the complainant attached copies of letters sent by SITEHOSTAC to MITRADEL on  and  September and  November , alleging, inter alia, that the enterprise was refusing to deduct union dues of members despite having been formally requested to do so on several occasions. The Committee notes that although it is apparent from the documents attached by the Government that a general inspection of the enterprise was conducted on  September , it is not apparent that the issue of union dues was the subject of the inspection. Noting that the Government attached a copy of the draft collective agreement submitted to the DGT by SITEHOSTAC on  February  and taking into account that it contains a clause relating to the deduction of union dues, the Committee expects that this issue has been resolved with the issuance of the aforementioned arbitration award and requests the Government to ensure that this aspect of the complaint is definitively resolved. Noting also that the draft collective agreement also contains a clause relating to the granting of union leave, the Committee expects that the allegation that the enterprise did not grant such leave has also been resolved with the issuance of the arbitration award and requests the Government also to ensure that this aspect of the complaint is definitively resolved.
.With regard to the allegation that the enterprise arbitrarily relocates members and changes the working hours of unionized workers and trade union leaders, requiring them to attend or leave work in the early morning, preventing union activities in the case of the leaders, while the Committee notes that the Government does not strictly refer to this allegation, the Government indicates that SITEHOSTAC filed allegations of anti-union persecution with the National Directorate of Inspection and that, after having conducted an inspection on  September , in March  the enterprise was subject to a penalty for violation of Act No.  of  concerning measures to prevent, prohibit and punish discriminatory acts. In the absence of specific information from the Government concerning the alleged relocations and recalling that no person shall be prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ], the Committee requests the Government to ensure that SITEHOSTAC leaders and members are not subject to discriminatory treatment on the basis of their union membership or activities.
.Concerning the allegation that the enterprise denied union leaders Mr Luis Hendricks, Mr Arqumedes Rodrguez and Mr Benjamn Villanero access to work, until they were reinstated by order of the DGT, and that they were not paid wages for the days on which they were unable to enter the enterprise, the Committee notes the Government s confirmation that the workers were reintegrated by order of the DGT. The Committee also notes the Government s indication that a number of appeals filed in relation to the request to impose a fine on the enterprise in respect of these events remain pending. The Committee notes these elements and expects that any pending appeal will be resolved promptly and in accordance with freedom of association and that, if the alleged anti-union nature of the exclusion of trade union leaders from their workplaces is established, they receive the wages due to them.
.The Committee notes the allegation that the enterprise threatened and forced Mr Jonny Lasso, Mr Kevin Snchez and Mr Ariel Gmez to withdraw from the union and threatened SITEHOSTAC members Mr Roger Almengor and Mr Francisco Banda so that they would accept and sign a mutual agreement to terminate the employment relationship, indicating that if they did not do so they would be given a letter of dismissal, all with the intention of weakening the union. While noting that the complaint does not contain specific documents relating to the situation of the aforementioned workers, and that the complainant does not indicate whether they instigated administrative and/or judicial proceedings in this respect, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent any observations in respect of these allegations. Recalling that direct threat and intimidation of members of a workers' organization and forcing them into committing themselves to sever their ties with the organization under the threat of termination constitutes a denial of these workers' freedom of association rights [see Compilation, para. ], the Committee requests the Government to ensure that workers in the enterprise are able to exercise their union activities without pressure or hindrance.
.The Committee notes that although it is apparent from the foregoing that allegations have been brought in respect of most of the matters at hand in this complaint and that on various occasions both the DGT and the National Directorate of Labour Inspection have intervened, conducting inspections, imposing penalties and ordering the reinstatement of workers, the Committee does not have at its disposal full information concerning the final settlement of a number of allegations of anti-union acts contained in the present complaint. Noting that the Government reported that, subsequent to the submission of the present complaint, an arbitration award was issued to resolve the collective dispute between the enterprise and SITEHOSTAC, and that in January  the trade union and the enterprise engaged in dialogue and reached an agreement on alleged violations of labour legislation, and having not subsequently received further information from the complainant, the Committee requests the Government to continue taking the necessary measures to ensure that SITEHOSTAC and its members are able to exercise their trade union activities without hindrance within the enterprise and to ensure that all issues raised in the present complaint are satisfactorily resolved. The Committee also expresses the hope that relations between SITEHOSTAC and the enterprise have improved and expects that the necessary efforts will be made",1,2020,Panama
2,"to ensure that they succeed in governing their relations through social dialogue and collective bargaining.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to continue taking the necessary measures to ensure that SITEHOSTAC and its members are able to exercise their trade union activities within the enterprise without hindrance and to ensure that all aspects of the present complaint have been satisfactorily resolved.(b) The Committee expects that any pending appeal relating to the reinstatement of trade union leaders will be resolved as soon as possible and requests the Government to ensure that if the alleged anti-union nature of the exclusion of trade union leaders from their workplaces is established, they have received the wages due to them.(c) The Committee expresses the hope that relations between SITEHOSTAC and the enterprise have improved and expects that the necessary efforts will be made so that they succeed in governing their relations through social dialogue and collective bargaining.(d) The Committee considers that this case is closed and does not call for further examination.",-1,2020,Panama
3,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Confederation of United Independent Unions of Panama (CONUSI) and the Panamanian Union of Commercial Aviators (UNPAC), dated  January .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  January .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  January , the complainant organizations allege that the Government is not complying with the recommendations of the Committee by not adapting its legislation to eliminate compulsory arbitration in collective bargaining negotiations, which is interfering in and limiting the exercise of the right to strike in violation of Conventions Nos  and .
.The complainant organizations indicate that Act No.  of  amended section  of the Labour Code and introduced a paragraph  which establishes that, if a collective dispute arises in a public service enterprise, according to the definition set out in section  of the Code, the regional or general labour directorate shall decide to submit the strike to arbitration, after it has begun. The complainant organizations consider that section () of the Labour Code violates Article  of Convention No.  as it restricts, limits, inhibits and curtails the right to strike of workers in public services by imposing compulsory arbitration as a dissuasive measure to diminish the rights and interests of trade union organizations. They also state that, although UNPAC filed a claim of unconstitutionality against section () of the Labour Code on  April , it was declared constitutional res judicata by a Supreme Court of Justice judgment of  October  (a copy of the judgment is attached to the complaint). According to the complainant organizations, this judgment runs counter to the jurisprudence of the Court, which in  indicated that,  international labour conventions that contain regulations concerning the recognition of human rights that are enjoyed in relation to work must form part of the body of constitutional law' 
.The complainant organizations state that compulsory arbitration is not being applied in a consensual manner between the parties and cite the example of the National Trade Union of Workers in the Aviation, Logistics, Similar and Related Industries of Panama (SIELAS), a trade union organization to which, according to the complaint, the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development (MITRADEL) applied compulsory arbitration through Resolution No. -DGT- in order to lift a strike declaration, a measure that the trade union had taken after failing to reach a satisfactory agreement with Copa Airlines (hereafter referred to as  the airline'  in the negotiation of a collective labour agreement. The complainant organizations allege that the workers of SIELAS were persecuted, intimidated and threatened by MITRADEL authorities and the security forces so that they would decline to declare a strike and thus compulsory arbitration was imposed.
.The complainant organizations understand that, while the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited in essential services in the strict sense of the term, that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population, the transport of passengers and goods is not an essential service in the strict sense of the term. The complainant organizations state that, while the transport of passengers and goods is a public service of primary importance in the country for which the requirement of a minimum service in the event of a strike could be justified, the imposition of arbitration as provided for in section () of the Labour Code could not.
.In its communications of  September  and  January , the Government states that on  August , SIELAS filed an application with the general labour directorate for a list of demands to negotiate a new collective agreement with the airline and given that an agreement could not be reached, the union proceeded in accordance with section  of the Labour Code to declare an indefinite strike as of  November . In response, the general labour directorate decided on the same day, through Resolution No. -DGT-, to submit the strike to arbitration and ordered its immediate suspension and the opening of the various work centres.
.The Government indicates that, although the complainant organizations submitted an application requesting that section () of the Labour Code be declared unconstitutional, the Supreme Court of Justice, in its judgment of  October , declared the provision in question to be constitutional res judicata and ordered that the case be shelved because the Court had previously ruled on the matter.
.The Government reports that, between  and the present day, SIELAS and the airline have concluded two collective agreements: one was in force from  December  until  December  and the other was concluded on  April  and is in force until . The Government highlights that the priority task of MITRADEL is to pursue industrial peace through respect for fundamental and labour rights, especially in its role as a mediator, which has allowed it to achieve a good understanding between the parties without affecting the decisions that the respective parties might take, since the provisions of the Labour Code are being applied correctly in order to achieve a favourable result that benefits the key actors in the labour relationship.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organizations allege that section () of the Labour Code restricts, limits, inhibits and curtails the right to strike by imposing compulsory arbitration in public services that are not essential in the strict sense of the term, such as the transport of passengers and goods in general and aviation in particular. The Committee observes that the complainant organizations specifically refer to a MITRADEL resolution that submits to compulsory arbitration the strike called by SIELAS at the end of .
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations and the Government indicate that in  UNPAC filed a claim of unconstitutionality against section () of the Labour Code. The Committee observes that, in its judgment, the Supreme Court of Justice indicated that this provision had already been the subject of a legal ruling of the Court in , and therefore declared paragraph  of the above-mentioned section to be constitutional res judicata and ordered that the case be shelved. The Committee observes that, in its  judgment, the Court recalled that article  of the Political Constitution established the recognition of the right to strike and that the law may subject it to special restrictions in the public services it determines. The Committee notes in this regard that the  and  rulings do not contain a specific review of the list of public services contained in the Labour Code for which the legislation provides for recourse to compulsory arbitration.
.The Committee also observes that the specific example cited by the complainant organizations, that is, the MITRADEL resolution that submitted to compulsory arbitration the strike called by SIELAS at the end of , is a matter that the Committee examined in a previous case on Panama [Case No. , Report No. ]. On that occasion, the Committee formulated the following conclusions and recommendations:. Regarding the strike initiated by SIELAS and the decision adopted by MITRADEL ordering compulsory arbitration and the end of the aforementioned strike, the Committee recalls that it has considered that compulsory arbitration to end a collective labour dispute and a strike is acceptable if it is at the request of both parties involved in a dispute, or if the strike in question may be restricted, even banned, i.e. in the case of disputes in the public service involving public servants exercising authority in the name of the State or in essential services in the strict sense of the term, namely those services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee also considered that in as far as compulsory arbitration prevents strike action, it is contrary to the right of trade unions to organize freely their activities and could only be justified in the public service or in essential services in the strict sense of the term [see Compilation, para. ].. [  The Committee recalls that, in its conclusions adopted in other cases relating to the air transport sectors of other countries, it considered that, based on the specific circumstances of each case, the air transport sector as a whole is not an essential public service in the strict sense. The Committee also highlights that it has considered that the establishment of minimum services in the case of strike action should only be possible in: () services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population (essential services in the strict sense of the term); () services which are not essential in",0,2020,Panama
4,"the strict sense of the term but where the extent and duration of a strike might be such as to result in an acute national crisis endangering the normal living conditions of the population; and () public services of fundamental importance [see Compilation, para. ]. In this respect, the Committee also considered that transportation of passengers and commercial goods is not an essential service in the strict sense of the term; however, this is a public service of primary importance where the requirement of a minimum service in the event of a strike can be justified [see Compilation, para. ].. In light of the above, the Committee requests the Government to take, in consultation with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations, the necessary measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that the rules on compulsory arbitration meet the criteria indicated above, in such a way that they do not unduly limit the exercise of the right to strike and collective bargaining in the air transport sector.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, SIELAS and the airline have concluded two collective agreements ('  and ' ). While duly noting this information, the Committee reaffirms the importance and the full applicability of the conclusions and recommendations adopted in relation to Case No. , in particular those related to the need to take measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that the rules on compulsory arbitration do not unduly limit the exercise of the right to strike and collective bargaining in the air transport sector. Taking into account that the Committee will once again examine these matters as part of the follow up given to that case, the Committee considers that the present case is closed and does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions that reiterate the importance and full applicability of the recommendations made in Case No. , which remains a case in follow-up, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not require any further examination.",-1,2020,Panama
5,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  August  and  April .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the complainant organization alleges that the Government interfered by requiring that collective bargaining for a new agreement in Ananas Trading Inc. Panama S.A. (an enterprise based in Panama that is dedicated to the agricultural export of pineapples, hereinafter  the enterprise'  be conducted with a union that is  compliant' towards the enterprise (the Ananas Trading Inc. Panama S.A. Workers' Union (SITRAATI)), to the detriment of the Union of Agroindustry and Related Industry Workers of Panama (SITAIP), which is affiliated to the Unified Confederation of Workers of Panama (CUTP).
.The complainant organization alleges that, on  June , a few weeks before the expiry of the collective agreement in force in the enterprise, SITRAATI tried to register a collective agreement in an irregular manner. On  June, SITAIP submitted a list of claims for the purposes of negotiating a new collective agreement with the enterprise, which was rejected by a decision of the Regional Labour Directorate for West Panama (DRTPO) dated  June . On  July , SITAIP appealed against this decision to the Ministry of Labour and Employment Development (MITRADEL), but in view of the delay on the part of MITRADEL in resolving the dispute, the workers initiated a strike, with the participation of more than  workers from the enterprise. On  July, the Minister of Labour overturned the decision by the DRTPO, setting the two unions in competition with each other, even though, according to the complainant organization, it was well known that SITAIP is the majority trade union in the enterprise, as is demonstrated by the fact that more than  workers provided written statements with their signatures and identity card numbers confirming that they had never been members of SITRAATI.
.The complainant organization alleges that MITRADEL ignored the majority status of SITAIP and decided in favour of SITRAATI, with the specific intention of favouring an organization with close ties to the enterprise, thereby continuing harmful practices that undermine trade union democracy and the rights of agribusiness workers.
.The complainant organization also states that, during this process, SITAIP submitted a second list of claims, this time concerning violation of the law, and carried out the formalities associated with the call for strike action to take place on  November . However, on  November , the MITRADEL office for West Panama, on the instructions of the Ministry s headquarters, decided to suspend the strike action, in violation of the workers' right to strike.
.Lastly, the complainant organization states that, in view of the actions of MITRADEL, it requested a meeting with the Office of the Ombudsperson of Panama, at which it was decided that the Office of the Ombudsperson would investigate the case, while it was also being brought before other bodies.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government provides its observations, noting that: (i) SITAIP submitted a list of claims to the DRTPO on  June  for the purposes of negotiating a collective agreement; (ii) by Order No. .-MC-DRTPO-, the DRTPO rejected the list of claims submitted by SITAIP and ordered that the case be closed on the grounds that a collective agreement already existed and was being negotiated directly by SITRAATI; (iii) in disagreement with the decision by the DRTPO, SITAIP filed an appeal against the aforementioned Order with the Office of the Minister of Labour; (iv) by Decision No. DM-- of  July , the Minister of Labour overturned Order No. .-MC-DRTPO- in its entirety and ordered compliance with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code and the referral of the case back to its originating office (the DRTPO) for appropriate action; (v) the DRTPO (Collective Mediation Branch), by Note No. -DRTPO-MC- of  August , on the grounds that SITAIP had submitted a list of claims when a collective agreement already existed and was being negotiated directly by SITRAATI, established that there were concurrent claims as set out in section  of the Labour Code and that the union with the largest number of members should be accredited for the purposes of initiating negotiations with that union; (vi) by Note No. -MC-DRTPO- of  September , the DRTPO established that, on  September , the Department of Social Organizations had submitted the requested information, reporting that SITAIP and SITRAATI had  and  members in the enterprise respectively, which meant that SITRAATI was the union designated to negotiate the lists of claims combined into a single list with a view to reaching a new collective agreement; (vii) as a result of the appeal filed by SITAIP against the aforementioned note, the DRTPO upheld its previous decision and stated that it was the responsibility of SITRAATI to negotiate both the list of claims submitted by SITAIP on  June  and that submitted by SITRAATI on  June ; and (ix) in the record of the opening of the negotiations on  September , held in the offices of the DRTPO, it was stated that, as it had  members, SITRAATI could renew the existing collective agreement and register it with the Department of Social Organizations in the Labour Directorate of MITRADEL. In its communication dated  April , the Government specifies that the collective agreement is registered with the Directorate General of Labour under registration No. / dated  November .
.The Government further notes that, on  September , SITAIP submitted a further list of claims against the enterprise alleging the violation of and non-compliance with the Labour Code and that, on  October , SITAIP submitted a formal call for strike action as of  November . Then, while the negotiations with SITAIP were under way and while the Inspection Department was being asked to provide support relating to the call for strike action, the strike action was suspended by order of MITRADEL.
.The Committee notes that the present case concerns, first of all, a situation involving concurrent claims and a dispute over representativeness in a pineapple-exporting enterprise and, secondly, the suspension of a strike initiated by one of the two trade unions involved.
.With regard to the issue of concurrent claims, the Committee notes that the complainant organization alleges that the Government interfered by requiring that collective bargaining for a new agreement in the enterprise be conducted with a trade union (SITRAATI) that is considered by the complainant organization to be  compliant' towards the enterprise, to the detriment of the sectoral trade union SITAIP. The Committee notes that the complainant organization alleges in particular that: (i) on  June , SITAIP submitted a list of claims for the purposes of negotiating a new collective agreement with the enterprise and that this list was rejected by a decision of the DRTPO dated  June , while SITRAATI for its part was trying to register a collective agreement with the enterprise in an irregular manner; (ii) on  July , SITAIP appealed to MITRADEL against this decision, but in view of the delay on the part of MITRADEL in resolving the dispute, the workers initiated a strike, involving more than  workers from the enterprise; and (iii) on  July, the Minister of Labour overturned the decision by the DRTPO and set the two unions in competition with each other, even though, according to the complainant organization, it was well known that SITAIP is the majority trade union.
.The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government states that: (i) the DRTPO, by Order No. .-MC-DRTPO-, rejected the list of claims submitted by SITAIP in June  on the grounds that a collective agreement already existed and was being negotiated directly by SITRAATI; (ii) in response to the appeal filed by SITAIP against the above-mentioned Order, the Minister of Labour, by Decision No. DM-- of  July , overturned Order No. .-MC-DRTPO-; (iii) by a note dated  August , the DRTPO (Collective Mediation Branch), on the grounds that SITAIP had submitted a list of claims when a collective agreement already existed and was being negotiated directly by SITRAATI, established that there were concurrent claims as set out in section  of the Labour Code and that the union with the largest number of members should be accredited for the purposes of initiating negotiations with that union; and (iv) based on the communication from the Department of Social Organizations in the Labour Directorate of MITRADEL, according to which SITAIP and SITRAATI had  and  members in the enterprise respectively, the DRTPO established on two occasions that it was the responsibility of SITRAATI to negotiate both the list of claims submitted by SITAIP on  June  and that submitted by SITRAATI on  June , and then it could, as the",0,2019,Panama
6,"majority union, renew the existing collective agreement and register it with the Department of Social Organizations in the Labour Directorate of MITRADEL.
.The Committee takes note of these points. It notes that the present case concerns an inter-union dispute between SITAIP and SITRAATI in connection with the renegotiation of the collective agreement in force, one month before its expiry. The Committee recalls that a matter involving no dispute between the government and the trade unions, but which involves a conflict within the trade union movement itself, is the sole responsibility of the parties themselves. The Committee also recalls that in cases of internal dissentions within a trade union organization, the Committee has pointed out that judicial intervention would permit a clarification of the situation from the legal point of view for the purpose of settling the question of the leadership and representation of the organization concerned [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee notes, on the one hand, that the complainant organization alleges that MITRADEL ignored the majority status of SITAIP and decided in favour of SITRAATI with the intention of favouring an organization with close ties to the enterprise and, on the other hand, that the Government states that it has simply applied the relevant provisions of the Labour Code, establishing that there were concurrent claims as set out in section  of the Code, and that it has acted on the basis of the information provided by the Department of Social Organizations, according to which SITRAATI is more representative, with more than twice the number of members. The Committee notes in this respect that MITRADEL overturned the first decision of the DRTPO to reject the list of demands submitted by SITAIP, pending confirmation of the representativeness of the unions, and that the membership figures on which MITRADEL based its decision to declare SITRAATI more representative are still being challenged by SITAIP.
.The Committee recalls that systems based on a sole bargaining agent (the most representative) and those which include all organizations or the most representative organizations in accordance with clear pre-established criteria for the determination of the organizations entitled to bargain are both compatible with Convention No. . The Committee also recalls that, where, under the system in force, the most representative union enjoys preferential or exclusive bargaining rights, decisions concerning the most representative organization should be made by virtue of objective and pre-established criteria so as to avoid any opportunities for partiality or abuse. The Committee also recalls that pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination of the representativity of workers' and employers' organizations should exist in the legislation and such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments [see Compilation, paras ,  and ]. In this regard, the Committee notes that, under section  of the Labour Code, in the event of concurrent claims and the absence of agreement between trade unions, the union with the largest membership in the enterprise has the right to bargain collectively. The Committee also recalls that the determination to ascertain or verify the representative character of trade unions can best be ensured when strong guarantees of secrecy and impartiality are offered. Thus, verification of the representative character of a union should a priori be carried out by an independent and impartial body [see Compilation, para. ]. In view of the fact that the complainant organization is questioning the assessment of representativeness carried out by the labour administration, the Committee requests both the Government and the complainant organization to indicate whether SITAIP has had the opportunity to challenge in court the decision by MITRADEL concerning the above-mentioned dispute over representativeness and, if so, to provide information on the outcome of such proceedings. Noting also that the complainant organization states that it has approached the Office of the Ombudsperson regarding allegations of favouritism by the Government towards SITRAATI, the Committee also requests the Government and the complainant organization to provide information on the outcome of the investigations carried out.
.With regard to the call for strike action submitted by SITAIP on  October , in the context of its list of claims concerning violation of the law, the Committee notes that the complainant organization alleges that SITAIP carried out the formalities associated with the call for strike action to take place on  November , but that, on  November , the MITRADEL office for West Panama, on the instructions of the Ministry s headquarters, decided to suspend the strike action. The Committee notes that the Government, for its part, confirms the facts as presented and states that, while negotiations were under way with SITAIP on the list of claims submitted for violation of the law and while the Inspection Department was being requested to provide support relating to the call for strike action, the strike action was suspended by order of MITRADEL.
.While noting that it has no information on the reasons for which MITRADEL decided to suspend the strike action in question, the Committee recalls, on the one hand, that it has considered that that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited: () in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State; or () in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population), and, furthermore, that the responsibility for suspending a strike should not lie with the Government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of all parties concerned [see Compilation, paras  and ]. In the light of the above, the Committee requests the Government to indicate the reasons for which MITRADEL decided to suspend the strike action initiated by SITAIP.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:(a) The Committee requests both the Government and the complainant organization to indicate whether SITAIP has had the opportunity to challenge in court the labour administration s decision concerning the dispute over representativeness and, if so, to provide information on the outcome of those proceedings. The Committee also requests the Government and the complainant organization to provide information on the outcome of the investigations carried out by the Office of the Ombudsperson into the allegations of favouritism towards SITRAATI.(b) The Committee requests the Government to indicate the reasons for which MITRADEL decided to suspend the strike action initiated by SITAIP.",-1,2019,Panama

.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  February, as well as  June and  September .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has decided to examine these two cases together, since they concern a similar issue, although raised from different union perspectives, and also because, in its replies, the Government emphasized that the cases are related.
.In their communication dated  June , the complainant organizations (SUNTRACS, CONUSI and the ICM) indicate that in , Minera Panam SA (hereafter  the enterprise' , a subsidiary of the Canadian mining company First Quantum Minerals (FQM), was awarded an over -year lease to develop a copper-mining project (hereafter  the mining project' , which was launched in December . The complainants allege that the enterprise obliged workers, when signing the employment contract, to join a union controlled by the enterprise: the FQM Construction and Development Enterprise Workers' Union (hereafter  the enterprise workers' union'  and that employment contracts were not given to those who refused to join.
.The complainant organizations indicate that, as a result of the labour exploitation of the mining project workers, who work more than -hour days without any occupational health and safety measures, a strike began on  March  and ended six days later, with mediation by the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development (MITRADEL) and with the signing of an agreement in which the enterprise agreed to address their concerns relating to occupational safety, food distribution and transportation. The complainants allege that the enterprise never fulfilled this agreement. They also indicate that the lack of safety and health measures led to the death on  December  of -year-old worker Faustino Daz.
.The complainant organizations state that, even though SUNTRACS is the most representative union in the construction sector, MITRADEL has always ruled in favour of the enterprise and the enterprise workers' union, recognizing it as the so-called representative of the workers and denying SUNTRACS the right to negotiate with the enterprise on behalf of its members. The complainants allege that MITRADEL s decisions of  November  and  April  are proof of this. They have provided a copy of the latter decision, which states that: (i) SUNTRACS and the enterprise workers' union simultaneously submitted of demands, and MITRADEL issued a decision ordering both to agree on the appointment of a joint representative to negotiate both lists with the enterprise, warning that should they fail to do so, the majority union would negotiate the lists; (ii) SUNTRACS submitted an application for amparo, which was granted due to the lack of grounds for the decision calling for the unions to agree and the violation of due process; (iii) MITRADEL issued a new decision ordering the unions to, within two working days, agree on the appointment of a joint representative to negotiate both lists, warning that should they fail to do so within the prescribed timeframe, the majority union would negotiate the lists; (iv) this decision was the subject of an administrative appeal filed by SUNTRACS, which was denied, thus upholding the decision; (v) the parties failed to reach an agreement and, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, MITRADEL tallied the number of members, establishing  members in SUNTRACS and  members in the enterprise workers' union, enabling the latter to negotiate the lists of both unions; and (vi) the decision was subject to appeal and review.
.The complainant organizations indicate that on  February , the workers held a strike, demanding a wage increase, respectful treatment, health care and the negotiation of a collective agreement between SUNTRACS and the enterprise. They state that the strike ended on  February  and that, two days later, they signed an agreement that put an end to the collective dispute, in which the enterprise agreed to, inter alia: (i) re-hire any workers who had participated in the strikes and whose short-term contracts had ended between  and  February ; (ii) initiate discussions with SUNTRACS aimed at finding solutions to various labour-related demands, including the negotiation of a new collective labour agreement between the parties; and (iii) not take reprisals against workers for having participated in the strike. The complainants allege that, with the complicity of MITRADEL, the enterprise has not honoured any of the terms established in the agreement. The complainants have sent a copy of a record dated  April , in which MITRADEL observed that the enterprise had not complied with the agreement dated  March  with regard to the re-hiring of workers who had been dismissed for having participated in the strike from  to  February . In the record, MITRADEL stated that it was going to explore legal measures to enforce the agreement.
.The complainant organizations also indicate that the enterprise refused to comply with reinstatement orders issued in favour of over  workers who had been dismissed without any justification or legal basis and that, in protest against the enterprise s failure to comply with the reinstatement orders, on  June , the workers held a peaceful protest at the entrance to the enterprise, which was violently repressed by Cocle national police and the enterprise s private security, who hit and arbitrarily arrested the workers who had been dismissed: Adolfo Yerena, Carlos Gondola, Hector Ramos Joniel Hall, Erick Prez, Luis Gaitan, Luis Martines, Jos Borbua, Jos Bonilla, Dagoberto Chang, Alejandro Valds and journalist Francis Guerra from an alternative media source, Frenadeso Noticias. The complainants indicate that when the workers filed a complaint, they were illegally taken into custody by members of the national police.
.In its communications of  September  and  June , the UGT indicates that within the mining project, there is an enterprise workers' union, presently known as the Industrial Union of Mine Construction and Mining Development and Allied Workers (STM), which is affiliated with the UGT and with Trade Union Convergence. The UGT indicates that since the s, SUNTRACS and the Panamanian Construction Industry Board (CAPAC) (enterprise organization) have been concluding collective labour agreements and alleges that the Government has been allowing SUNTRACS to try to impose on workers who are not members of SUNTRACS and who work in enterprises that are not affiliated with CAPAC the collective labour agreements signed by these two organizations. It also alleges that the Government has been complicit and allowed SUNTRACS to oblige the construction workers to pay it union dues, even though they are not members of the organization and even though the enterprises for which they work are not members of CAPAC. According to the complainant, this situation has caused chaos and confrontations between the mining project workers. The UGT further alleges that SUNTRACS is trying to have a union monopoly in the country and that the Government is being passive in this regard.
.The complainant organization has sent a document entitled  Violence and blackmail by the main leaders of SUNTRACS' dated  March , which indicates that SUNTRACS s political struggle for a union monopoly in the country spans more than two decades and that its strategy is based on discrediting other trade union leaders who do not support its interests and on inflicting violence and terrorizing workers and business owners. The document also mentions that on  January , a group of workers and activists supported by SUNTRACS violently took over the premises of the enterprise undertaking the mining project, injuring  workers. Furthermore, in February , SUNTRACS violently barged into the enterprise, leading the UGT to question why the Government allowed SUNTRACS to illegally occupy the enterprise premises for over  hours and why the Government would oblige the enterprise to sign an agreement with a non-mining-related trade union. The complainant has sent links to various articles published in the press referring to the above.
.The complainant organization has also sent a document entitled  Chronology of the conflict in Minera Panam'  according to which: (i) the enterprise workers' union acquired legal status in February  and continues to be the majority union in the mining project; (ii) on  September , MITRADEL registered the first collective agreement between the enterprise workers' union and the enterprise, which is valid for four years; (iii) on  March , a group of workers from a CAPAC-affiliated contracting enterprise for the Minera Panam project carried out a work stoppage, blocking the exit of workers from all areas of project; given that these workers were covered by a collective labour agreement concluded between SUNTRACS and CAPAC, the latter demanded that the",0,2018,Panama
8,"enterprise apply the agreement with CAPAC, which was not legally possible, since the enterprise had already concluded a collective agreement with the STM; (iv) in September , MITRADEL approved changing the name of the enterprise union, which became an industrial union called the Industrial Union of Mine Construction and Mining Development and Allied Workers (STM); and (v) in  and , following several rounds of negotiations and even a strike held by the STM in January , the STM and the enterprise signed various agreements relating to worker accommodation, the transportation system and conditions in dining areas.
.In its communications dated  and  February, as well as  June and  September , the Government sent its observations for both cases, as well as those of the enterprise, the National Council of Private Enterprise (CONEP) and CAPAC. The Government indicates that Cases Nos  and  concern the construction sector and, in particular, an inter-union dispute that has arisen in the mining project. The Government indicates that it is making significant efforts to ensure that all the organizations are able to fully enjoy freedom of association and that it cannot take sides in disputes between unions over the ownership of rights, such as the dispute between SUNTRACS and the enterprise workers' union, which is now known as the STM and is affiliated with the UGT. The Government adds that it is regrettable that the complaints have not been discussed in the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints, one of the committees under the Panama Tripartite Agreement, which meets weekly in MITRADEL and looks for consensual solutions to the cases brought before it.
.The Government indicates that on  October , MITRADEL established a special bureau on mining, with  public officials responsible for handling labour issues, in the light of the complexity of the mining-related occupations, as well as the large number of mining workers, who total approximately ,.
.The Government indicates that in the mining project, union activities are wide-ranging and freely exercised and that five unions, including the enterprise workers' union (now known as the STM) and SUNTRACS, co-exist. The Government indicates that MITRADEL has been an ally to all the trade union organizations in the search for instruments that promote respect for freedom of association and that, on several occasions, it has engaged in mediation and that various agreements have been signed and put an end to disputes. The Government refers in particular to the agreement signed on  March , in which it was agreed that SUNTRACS would have access to the mining project and to the agreement dated  March  (signed on  March ) which includes clauses relating to visits by SUNTRACS representatives to the mining project. The Government indicates that it has not been aware of any complaints regarding the implementation of the latter agreement, with regard to visits and the presence of SUNTRACS in the mining project, so it assumes that it is being implemented to the satisfaction of the parties.
.In its reply communicated by the Government, the enterprise indicates that it does not intervene in the unions' internal affairs; that it does not interfere with right of workers to join the union of their choice or to refrain from joining a trade union organization; and that it does not favour any trade union organization. The enterprise denies the complainants' allegation that it obliges workers, when signing the employment contract, to join the enterprise workers' union.
.The enterprise indicates that on several occasions, SUNTRACS, through the use of violence and threats, has tried to force the enterprise to negotiate with it instead of with the STM, which has the right to negotiate because it is the most representative union, as it has a larger number of enterprise workers than SUNTRACS does. The enterprise states that in  and , SUNTRACS and the STM submitted lists of demands at the same time and that, on both occasions, MITRADEL, after tallying the number of enterprise workers belonging to each union, found that the STM was the most representative union and was therefore entitled to negotiate the collective labour agreement. The enterprise indicates that even though SUNTRACS is a minority union in terms of enterprise workers, in March , it concluded an agreement and protocol for admission to the mining project with the enterprise, even though on several occasions, SUNTRACS has violently barged into the company premises, causing a work stoppage each time and jeopardizing the lives and integrity of all. The Government adds that SUNTRACS and the STM have applied to MITRADEL for the right to negotiate a new collective labour agreement, and that the procedure established in the Labour Code has been followed. The applications are still being processed due to the submission by SUNTRACS of applications for amparo, which must first be resolved.
.As regards the reinstatement orders, the company indicates that the courts had issued those orders before the company had been heard. It also indicates that the company had challenged those orders and that, after hearing the parties and considering the facts and evidence, the courts had thus far issued a ruling in six of the  cases, revoking the respective reinstatement orders. The company indicates that SUNTRACS lodged an appeal and that, in two cases, the Higher Labour Court of the First Judicial District issued a ruling that confirmed the revocation of the reinstatement orders, with those rulings duly enforced. The Government has sent the text of these rulings, which concluded that the company had not dismissed the workers but rather that the labour relationship had ended as their fixed-term contracts had expired and therefore reinstatement was not appropriate.
.As regards the alleged arbitrary detentions of workers engaging in peaceful protest calling for their reinstatement, the Government has sent a copy of a report by the national police dated  June , signed by the chief of the second police district of Cocle, that indicates that there is no record of the detentions of the citizens named in the complaint.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government indicated that it was making every relevant effort to ensure that all trade unions were able to fully exercise their freedom of association and that it was unable to intervene in inter-union disputes nor in engagement with employers' associations in the scope of that freedom. The Government also indicated that SUNTRACS had signed a collective labour agreement with CAPAC (which brings together around  companies) in compliance with the conciliation procedures set forth in the Labour Code, and that MITRADEL did not have the authority to stop a company from negotiating a collective agreement with SUNTRACS with content identical to that contained in the agreement signed between SUNTRACS and CAPAC.
.CAPAC indicates that it is an employers' organization that brings together the leading companies in the construction sector; that, since , it has negotiated ten collective labour agreements with SUNTRACS that regulate labour relations between CAPAC members, which are generalist and specialist contractors, and their workers; and that those agreements were negotiated in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code.
.The Committee observes that Cases Nos  and  concern the same mining project that has involved around , workers since . While the Committee observes that the allegations in the cases are different and the complaints were made by different organizations, it notes that the Government has indicated that the two cases are related, the common denominator being the dispute between two of the five trade unions involved in the project ' SUNTRACS (complainant in Case No. ) and the STM, which is affiliated with the UGT (complainant in Case No. ) ' regarding the ownership of rights to negotiate with the company. On this basis, the Committee has decided to examine both cases in one report, first examining each complaint separately and then presenting its conclusions in relation to their common elements.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations allege that: (i) the company requires workers to join the STM, a trade union controlled by the company, and that although SUNTRACS has presented a list of demands for the purpose of negotiating collective labour agreements with the company, MITRADEL has favoured the STM, recognizing it as the implied representative of workers, thereby denying SUNTRACS the right to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of its members; (ii) the company has breached post-dispute agreements reached with SUNTRACS, including one signed on  March  in which, among other points, the company had undertaken to reinstate workers dismissed for participating in a strike; they also allege that MITRADEL has not taken steps to demand compliance with the agreement; and (iii) workers who participated in a peaceful protest calling for their reinstatement, which was ordered by the courts, were restrained by police and detained arbitrarily.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government and the company indicate that: (i) the company does not oblige workers to join any particular trade union and negotiates collective labour agreements with the STM and not with SUNTRACS because MITRADEL has determined",-1,2018,Panama
9,"that the STM is the most representative trade union and has the right to negotiate; the Government also indicates that both trade unions had subsequently asked MITRADEL to negotiate a new collective labour agreement and that these proceedings are ongoing as SUNTRACS has lodged an amparo appeal; (ii) MITRADEL has mediated between SUNTRACS and the company in order to resolve a number of different disputes and has facilitated the conclusion of agreements that allowed access and the presence of SUNTRACS in the mining project; and (iii) there is no record of police detention of the workers mentioned in the complaint and the workers have not been reinstated because the courts have revoked the reinstatement orders on the basis that the workers had not been dismissed but rather the term of their contracts had expired.
.Recalling that workers have the right to join organizations of their own choosing and that the authorities and employers should avoid all discrimination between trade unions, the Committee observes that in this case there are no elements that lead it to conclude that the company required the workers to join a particular union.
.As regards collective bargaining, the Committee observes that the MITRADEL resolution dated  April  determined that the STM, and not SUNTRACS, would negotiate lists of demands because the STM was deemed to be the most representative given that it had more than double the number of members as SUNTRACS. In relation to the allegation that, through this resolution, MITRADEL denied SUNTRACS the right to negotiate in favour of its members in the mining project, the Committee recalls that the determination of the most representative trade union should always be based on objective and pre-established criteria so as to avoid any opportunity for partiality or abuse. Pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination of the representativity of workers' and employers' organizations should exist in the legislation and such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments. The Committee also recalls that systems based on a sole bargaining agent (the most representative) and those which include all organizations or the most representative organizations in accordance with clear pre-established criteria for the determination of the organizations entitled to bargain are both compatible with Convention No.  [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras ,  and ].
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that both trade unions subsequently asked MITRADEL to negotiate a new collective labour agreement and that these proceedings are ongoing as SUNTRACS has lodged an amparo appeal in that respect. The Committee expects that the courts will shortly rule on the amparo proceedings described above.
.As regards compliance with the agreements that ended disputes between SUNTRACS and the company, the Committee observes that, while MITRADEL facilitated the conclusion of agreements, which, among other things, allowed access and the presence of SUNTRACS in the mining project, MITRADEL has also noted the company s non-compliance with some points of these agreements. The Committee observes that, in a record dated  April , attached by the complainant organizations, MITRADEL indicated that the company had breached the agreement signed on  March , specifically by not reinstating the workers whom the company had committed to reinstate in the agreement. The Committee observes that MITRADEL had indicated in this record that it would examine the legal steps to be taken towards compliance with the agreement. The Committee recalls that agreements should be binding on the parties [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ] and expects that MITRADEL, as a facilitator of and signatory to the agreements, will take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with the agreements in question.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the complainant organizations allege that the company refused to comply with reinstatement orders issued in favour of more than  workers dismissed without justification or legal grounding. In that respect, the Committee notes that the company indicates that it has challenged these reinstatement orders and that the courts had thus far revoked six of the  reinstatement orders on the basis that the workers had not been dismissed but rather their contracts had expired. The Committee observes that neither the complainants nor the Government provided a copy of the reinstatement orders, which has prevented the Committee from ascertaining the reasons why the reinstatement was ordered. The Committee observes, however, that the Government has provided copies of the rulings that revoked the reinstatement orders and indicates that the names of the workers mentioned therein do not match the names of the workers whom the company had undertaken to reinstate in the agreement. In the light of the above, and given that there are pending judicial proceedings relating to the challenge filed against the reinstatement orders, the Committee expects that the courts will shortly rule on the matter and that the decisions issued will be respected.
.Regarding the allegation of police repression and detention of protesting workers calling for their reinstatement, the Committee observes that the complainant organizations did not send any information or evidence relating to the alleged police repression. It also observes that it is unclear whether the information submitted by the complainants refers to detention by the police or by the company s private security services. Furthermore, the Committee has no information regarding the date on which the workers would have been released. On that basis, and noting that the Government has declared that there is no record that the workers were detained by the police, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.The Committee notes that the UGT, which is affiliated with the STM, alleges that the Government condoned attempts by SUNTRACS to enforce the collective agreement that it had signed with CAPAC on non-members employed by construction companies not affiliated with CAPAC (in particular workers employed by mining project contractors). It also alleges that the Government has condoned attempts by SUNTRACS to require construction workers, including non-members, to pay trade union dues to SUNTRACS. The Committee also observes that, according to the complainant, SUNTRACS inflicted violence and terror on workers and employers and on several occasions SUNTRACS members violently took over the company s premises, resulting in injuries to several workers.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the collective labour agreements signed between SUNTRACS and CAPAC follow the procedure set forth in the Labour Code and that MITRADEL cannot stop a company from negotiating a collective agreement with SUNTRACS with content identical to that contained in the agreement signed between SUNTRACS and CAPAC. The Committee also notes that CAPAC indicated that it is an employers' organization that brings together the leading companies in the construction sector; that, since , it has negotiated ten collective labour agreements with SUNTRACS that regulate labour relations between CAPAC members, which are generalist and specialist contractors, and their workers; and all such agreements were negotiated in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code.
.The Committee observes that, according to the complainant organization s allegations, SUNTRACS sought to impose the terms of its collective labour agreement with CAPAC on the workers of a CAPAC-affiliated mining project contractor. According to the complainant, this would not be legally viable since the company already has a collective agreement with the STM that covers these workers. In this respect, the Committee recalls that systems of collective bargaining with exclusive rights for the most representative trade union and those where it is possible for a number of collective agreements to be concluded by a number of trade unions within a company are both compatible with the principles of freedom of association [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ].
.As regards the allegations of violent actions by SUNTRACS, while the Committee observes that the complainant organization has sent a link to various articles published in the press that indicate that SUNTRACS violently entered the company s premises, these and other press articles also indicate that STM-affiliated workers who wanted SUNTRACS to withdraw from the project had protested violently against SUNTRACS members, preventing them from accessing the company s premises. In this regard, the Committee recalls that trade union organizations should conduct themselves responsibly and respect the peaceful manner in which the right of assembly should be exercised [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ].
.The Committee observes that both cases contain allegations of favouritism on the part of the Government towards one trade union organization or the other. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that it cannot intervene in the dispute between SUNTRACS and the STM and that it laments the fact that the complaints have not been discussed in the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints, a commission established in the scope of the Panama Tripartite Agreement that seeks to resolve cases with consensual solutions.
.The Committee observes that the information and documentation submitted in both cases demonstrate that the Government, through MITRADEL, has acted as a mediator in numerous disputes within the company, has facilitated the signing of agreements and has proved that the company has breached",1,2018,Panama
10,"some points of such agreements. The information and documentation submitted in both cases does not lead the Committee to conclude that there has been any favouritism or special treatment of either trade union organization by the Government.
.In the light of the above, and given that several matters raised in the complaints appear to be recurring and unresolved issues, the Committee invites the Government to seek to foster a climate of dialogue and trust when interacting with the trade unions concerned and the company, against a backdrop of trade union pluralism, to help to maintain harmonious labour relations within the company. To this end, the Committee encourages the Government to redouble its efforts towards dialogue and conciliation and to examine, together with the organizations and the company, the issues raised with a view to reaching agreements that overcome these challenges with the support of tripartite dialogue forums within the country.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee expects that the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development (MITRADEL), as a facilitator of and signatory to the agreements signed between the trade unions and the company, will take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with the agreements in question.(b)	The Committee expects that the courts will shortly rule on the pending judicial proceedings relating to the reinstatement of the workers and that the decisions issued will be respected.(c)	The Committee invites the Government to seek to foster a climate of dialogue and trust when interacting with the trade unions concerned and the company, against a backdrop of trade union pluralism, to help to maintain harmonious labour relations within the company.

.In their communication dated  June , the complainant organizations (SUNTRACS, CONUSI and the ICM) indicate that in , Minera Panam SA (hereafter  the enterprise' , a subsidiary of the Canadian mining company First Quantum Minerals (FQM), was awarded an over -year lease to develop a copper-mining project (hereafter  the mining project' , which was launched in December . The complainants allege that the enterprise obliged workers, when signing the employment contract, to join a union controlled by the enterprise: the FQM Construction and Development Enterprise Workers' Union (hereafter  the enterprise workers' union'  and that employment contracts were not given to those who refused to join.

The complainants allege that MITRADEL s decisions of  November  and  April  are proof of this. They have provided a copy of the latter decision, which states that: (i) SUNTRACS and the enterprise workers' union simultaneously submitted of demands, and MITRADEL issued a decision ordering both to agree on the appointment of a joint representative to negotiate both lists with the enterprise, warning that should they fail to do so, the majority union would negotiate the lists; (ii) SUNTRACS submitted an application for amparo, which was granted due to the lack of grounds for the decision calling for the unions to agree and the violation of due process; (iii) MITRADEL issued a new decision ordering the unions to, within two working days, agree on the appointment of a joint representative to negotiate both lists, warning that should they fail to do so within the prescribed timeframe, the majority union would negotiate the lists; (iv) this decision was the subject of an administrative appeal filed by SUNTRACS, which was denied, thus upholding the decision; (v) the parties failed to reach an agreement and, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, MITRADEL tallied the number of members, establishing  members in SUNTRACS and  members in the enterprise workers' union, enabling the latter to negotiate the lists of both unions; and (vi) the decision was subject to appeal and review.
.The complainant organizations indicate that on  February , the workers held a strike, demanding a wage increase, respectful treatment, health care and the negotiation of a collective agreement between SUNTRACS and the enterprise. They state that the strike ended on  February  and that, two days later, they signed an agreement that put an end to the collective dispute, in which the enterprise agreed to, inter alia: (i) re-hire any workers who had participated in the strikes and whose short-term contracts had ended between  and  February ; (ii) initiate discussions with SUNTRACS aimed at finding solutions to various labour-related demands, including the negotiation of a new collective labour agreement between the parties; and (iii) not take reprisals against workers for having participated in the strike. The complainants allege that, with the complicity of MITRADEL, the enterprise has not honoured any of the terms established in the agreement. The complainants have sent a copy of a record dated  April , in which MITRADEL observed that the enterprise had not complied with the agreement dated  March  with regard to the re-hiring of workers who had been dismissed for having participated in the strike from  to  February . In the record, MITRADEL stated that it was going to explore legal measures to enforce the agreement.
.The complainant organizations also indicate that the enterprise refused to comply with reinstatement orders issued in favour of over  workers who had been dismissed without any justification or legal basis and that, in protest against the enterprise s failure to comply with the reinstatement orders, on  June , the workers held a peaceful protest at the entrance to the enterprise, which was violently repressed by Cocle national police and the enterprise s private security, who hit and arbitrarily arrested the workers who had been dismissed: Adolfo Yerena, Carlos Gondola, Hector Ramos Joniel Hall, Erick Prez, Luis Gaitan, Luis Martines, Jos Borbua, Jos Bonilla, Dagoberto Chang, Alejandro Valds and journalist Francis Guerra from an alternative media source, Frenadeso Noticias. The complainants indicate that when the workers filed a complaint, they were illegally taken into custody by members of the national police.
.In its communications of  September  and  June , the UGT indicates that within the mining project, there is an enterprise workers' union, presently known as the Industrial Union of Mine Construction and Mining Development and Allied Workers (STM), which is affiliated with the UGT and with Trade Union Convergence. The UGT indicates that since the s, SUNTRACS and the Panamanian Construction Industry Board (CAPAC) (enterprise organization) have been concluding collective labour agreements and alleges that the Government has been allowing SUNTRACS to try to impose on workers who are not members of SUNTRACS and who work in enterprises that are not affiliated with CAPAC the collective labour agreements signed by these two organizations. It also alleges that the Government has been complicit and allowed SUNTRACS to oblige the construction workers to pay it union dues, even though they are not members of the organization and even though the enterprises for which they work are not members of CAPAC. According to the complainant, this situation has caused chaos and confrontations between the mining project workers. The UGT further alleges that SUNTRACS is trying to have a union monopoly in the country and that the Government is being passive in this regard.
.The complainant organization has sent a document entitled  Violence and blackmail by the main leaders of SUNTRACS' dated  March , which indicates that SUNTRACS s political struggle for a union monopoly in the country spans more than two decades and that its strategy is based on discrediting other trade union leaders who do not support its interests and on inflicting violence and terrorizing workers and business owners. The document also mentions that on  January , a group of workers and activists supported by SUNTRACS violently took over the premises of the enterprise undertaking the mining project, injuring  workers. Furthermore, in February , SUNTRACS violently barged into the enterprise, leading the UGT to question why the Government allowed SUNTRACS to illegally occupy the enterprise premises for over  hours and why the Government would oblige the enterprise to sign an agreement with a non-mining-related trade union. The complainant has sent links to various articles published in the press referring to the above.
.The complainant organization has also sent a document entitled  Chronology of the conflict in Minera Panam'  according to which: (i) the enterprise workers' union acquired legal status in February  and continues to be the majority union in the mining project; (ii) on  September , MITRADEL registered the first collective agreement between the enterprise workers' union and the enterprise, which is valid for four years; (iii) on  March , a group of workers from a CAPAC-affiliated contracting enterprise for the Minera Panam project carried out a work stoppage, blocking the exit of workers from all areas of project; given that these workers were covered by a collective labour agreement concluded between SUNTRACS and CAPAC, the latter demanded that the",0,2018,Panama
12,"enterprise apply the agreement with CAPAC, which was not legally possible, since the enterprise had already concluded a collective agreement with the STM; (iv) in September , MITRADEL approved changing the name of the enterprise union, which became an industrial union called the Industrial Union of Mine Construction and Mining Development and Allied Workers (STM); and (v) in  and , following several rounds of negotiations and even a strike held by the STM in January , the STM and the enterprise signed various agreements relating to worker accommodation, the transportation system and conditions in dining areas.
.In its communications dated  and  February, as well as  June and  September , the Government sent its observations for both cases, as well as those of the enterprise, the National Council of Private Enterprise (CONEP) and CAPAC. The Government indicates that Cases Nos  and  concern the construction sector and, in particular, an inter-union dispute that has arisen in the mining project. The Government indicates that it is making significant efforts to ensure that all the organizations are able to fully enjoy freedom of association and that it cannot take sides in disputes between unions over the ownership of rights, such as the dispute between SUNTRACS and the enterprise workers' union, which is now known as the STM and is affiliated with the UGT. The Government adds that it is regrettable that the complaints have not been discussed in the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints, one of the committees under the Panama Tripartite Agreement, which meets weekly in MITRADEL and looks for consensual solutions to the cases brought before it.
.The Government indicates that on  October , MITRADEL established a special bureau on mining, with  public officials responsible for handling labour issues, in the light of the complexity of the mining-related occupations, as well as the large number of mining workers, who total approximately ,.
.The Government indicates that in the mining project, union activities are wide-ranging and freely exercised and that five unions, including the enterprise workers' union (now known as the STM) and SUNTRACS, co-exist. The Government indicates that MITRADEL has been an ally to all the trade union organizations in the search for instruments that promote respect for freedom of association and that, on several occasions, it has engaged in mediation and that various agreements have been signed and put an end to disputes. The Government refers in particular to the agreement signed on  March , in which it was agreed that SUNTRACS would have access to the mining project and to the agreement dated  March  (signed on  March ) which includes clauses relating to visits by SUNTRACS representatives to the mining project. The Government indicates that it has not been aware of any complaints regarding the implementation of the latter agreement, with regard to visits and the presence of SUNTRACS in the mining project, so it assumes that it is being implemented to the satisfaction of the parties.
.In its reply communicated by the Government, the enterprise indicates that it does not intervene in the unions' internal affairs; that it does not interfere with right of workers to join the union of their choice or to refrain from joining a trade union organization; and that it does not favour any trade union organization. The enterprise denies the complainants' allegation that it obliges workers, when signing the employment contract, to join the enterprise workers' union.
.The enterprise indicates that on several occasions, SUNTRACS, through the use of violence and threats, has tried to force the enterprise to negotiate with it instead of with the STM, which has the right to negotiate because it is the most representative union, as it has a larger number of enterprise workers than SUNTRACS does. The enterprise states that in  and , SUNTRACS and the STM submitted lists of demands at the same time and that, on both occasions, MITRADEL, after tallying the number of enterprise workers belonging to each union, found that the STM was the most representative union and was therefore entitled to negotiate the collective labour agreement. The enterprise indicates that even though SUNTRACS is a minority union in terms of enterprise workers, in March , it concluded an agreement and protocol for admission to the mining project with the enterprise, even though on several occasions, SUNTRACS has violently barged into the company premises, causing a work stoppage each time and jeopardizing the lives and integrity of all. The Government adds that SUNTRACS and the STM have applied to MITRADEL for the right to negotiate a new collective labour agreement, and that the procedure established in the Labour Code has been followed. The applications are still being processed due to the submission by SUNTRACS of applications for amparo, which must first be resolved.
.As regards the reinstatement orders, the company indicates that the courts had issued those orders before the company had been heard. It also indicates that the company had challenged those orders and that, after hearing the parties and considering the facts and evidence, the courts had thus far issued a ruling in six of the  cases, revoking the respective reinstatement orders. The company indicates that SUNTRACS lodged an appeal and that, in two cases, the Higher Labour Court of the First Judicial District issued a ruling that confirmed the revocation of the reinstatement orders, with those rulings duly enforced. The Government has sent the text of these rulings, which concluded that the company had not dismissed the workers but rather that the labour relationship had ended as their fixed-term contracts had expired and therefore reinstatement was not appropriate.
.As regards the alleged arbitrary detentions of workers engaging in peaceful protest calling for their reinstatement, the Government has sent a copy of a report by the national police dated  June , signed by the chief of the second police district of Cocle, that indicates that there is no record of the detentions of the citizens named in the complaint.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government indicated that it was making every relevant effort to ensure that all trade unions were able to fully exercise their freedom of association and that it was unable to intervene in inter-union disputes nor in engagement with employers' associations in the scope of that freedom. The Government also indicated that SUNTRACS had signed a collective labour agreement with CAPAC (which brings together around  companies) in compliance with the conciliation procedures set forth in the Labour Code, and that MITRADEL did not have the authority to stop a company from negotiating a collective agreement with SUNTRACS with content identical to that contained in the agreement signed between SUNTRACS and CAPAC.
.CAPAC indicates that it is an employers' organization that brings together the leading companies in the construction sector; that, since , it has negotiated ten collective labour agreements with SUNTRACS that regulate labour relations between CAPAC members, which are generalist and specialist contractors, and their workers; and that those agreements were negotiated in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code.
.The Committee observes that Cases Nos  and  concern the same mining project that has involved around , workers since . While the Committee observes that the allegations in the cases are different and the complaints were made by different organizations, it notes that the Government has indicated that the two cases are related, the common denominator being the dispute between two of the five trade unions involved in the project ' SUNTRACS (complainant in Case No. ) and the STM, which is affiliated with the UGT (complainant in Case No. ) ' regarding the ownership of rights to negotiate with the company. On this basis, the Committee has decided to examine both cases in one report, first examining each complaint separately and then presenting its conclusions in relation to their common elements.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations allege that: (i) the company requires workers to join the STM, a trade union controlled by the company, and that although SUNTRACS has presented a list of demands for the purpose of negotiating collective labour agreements with the company, MITRADEL has favoured the STM, recognizing it as the implied representative of workers, thereby denying SUNTRACS the right to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of its members; (ii) the company has breached post-dispute agreements reached with SUNTRACS, including one signed on  March  in which, among other points, the company had undertaken to reinstate workers dismissed for participating in a strike; they also allege that MITRADEL has not taken steps to demand compliance with the agreement; and (iii) workers who participated in a peaceful protest calling for their reinstatement, which was ordered by the courts, were restrained by police and detained arbitrarily.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government and the company indicate that: (i) the company does not oblige workers to join any particular trade union and negotiates collective labour agreements with the STM and not with SUNTRACS because MITRADEL has determined",-1,2018,Panama
13,"that the STM is the most representative trade union and has the right to negotiate; the Government also indicates that both trade unions had subsequently asked MITRADEL to negotiate a new collective labour agreement and that these proceedings are ongoing as SUNTRACS has lodged an amparo appeal; (ii) MITRADEL has mediated between SUNTRACS and the company in order to resolve a number of different disputes and has facilitated the conclusion of agreements that allowed access and the presence of SUNTRACS in the mining project; and (iii) there is no record of police detention of the workers mentioned in the complaint and the workers have not been reinstated because the courts have revoked the reinstatement orders on the basis that the workers had not been dismissed but rather the term of their contracts had expired.
.Recalling that workers have the right to join organizations of their own choosing and that the authorities and employers should avoid all discrimination between trade unions, the Committee observes that in this case there are no elements that lead it to conclude that the company required the workers to join a particular union.
.As regards collective bargaining, the Committee observes that the MITRADEL resolution dated  April  determined that the STM, and not SUNTRACS, would negotiate lists of demands because the STM was deemed to be the most representative given that it had more than double the number of members as SUNTRACS. In relation to the allegation that, through this resolution, MITRADEL denied SUNTRACS the right to negotiate in favour of its members in the mining project, the Committee recalls that the determination of the most representative trade union should always be based on objective and pre-established criteria so as to avoid any opportunity for partiality or abuse. Pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination of the representativity of workers' and employers' organizations should exist in the legislation and such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments. The Committee also recalls that systems based on a sole bargaining agent (the most representative) and those which include all organizations or the most representative organizations in accordance with clear pre-established criteria for the determination of the organizations entitled to bargain are both compatible with Convention No.  [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras ,  and ].
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that both trade unions subsequently asked MITRADEL to negotiate a new collective labour agreement and that these proceedings are ongoing as SUNTRACS has lodged an amparo appeal in that respect. The Committee expects that the courts will shortly rule on the amparo proceedings described above.
.As regards compliance with the agreements that ended disputes between SUNTRACS and the company, the Committee observes that, while MITRADEL facilitated the conclusion of agreements, which, among other things, allowed access and the presence of SUNTRACS in the mining project, MITRADEL has also noted the company s non-compliance with some points of these agreements. The Committee observes that, in a record dated  April , attached by the complainant organizations, MITRADEL indicated that the company had breached the agreement signed on  March , specifically by not reinstating the workers whom the company had committed to reinstate in the agreement. The Committee observes that MITRADEL had indicated in this record that it would examine the legal steps to be taken towards compliance with the agreement. The Committee recalls that agreements should be binding on the parties [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ] and expects that MITRADEL, as a facilitator of and signatory to the agreements, will take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with the agreements in question.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the complainant organizations allege that the company refused to comply with reinstatement orders issued in favour of more than  workers dismissed without justification or legal grounding. In that respect, the Committee notes that the company indicates that it has challenged these reinstatement orders and that the courts had thus far revoked six of the  reinstatement orders on the basis that the workers had not been dismissed but rather their contracts had expired. The Committee observes that neither the complainants nor the Government provided a copy of the reinstatement orders, which has prevented the Committee from ascertaining the reasons why the reinstatement was ordered. The Committee observes, however, that the Government has provided copies of the rulings that revoked the reinstatement orders and indicates that the names of the workers mentioned therein do not match the names of the workers whom the company had undertaken to reinstate in the agreement. In the light of the above, and given that there are pending judicial proceedings relating to the challenge filed against the reinstatement orders, the Committee expects that the courts will shortly rule on the matter and that the decisions issued will be respected.
.Regarding the allegation of police repression and detention of protesting workers calling for their reinstatement, the Committee observes that the complainant organizations did not send any information or evidence relating to the alleged police repression. It also observes that it is unclear whether the information submitted by the complainants refers to detention by the police or by the company s private security services. Furthermore, the Committee has no information regarding the date on which the workers would have been released. On that basis, and noting that the Government has declared that there is no record that the workers were detained by the police, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.The Committee notes that the UGT, which is affiliated with the STM, alleges that the Government condoned attempts by SUNTRACS to enforce the collective agreement that it had signed with CAPAC on non-members employed by construction companies not affiliated with CAPAC (in particular workers employed by mining project contractors). It also alleges that the Government has condoned attempts by SUNTRACS to require construction workers, including non-members, to pay trade union dues to SUNTRACS. The Committee also observes that, according to the complainant, SUNTRACS inflicted violence and terror on workers and employers and on several occasions SUNTRACS members violently took over the company s premises, resulting in injuries to several workers.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the collective labour agreements signed between SUNTRACS and CAPAC follow the procedure set forth in the Labour Code and that MITRADEL cannot stop a company from negotiating a collective agreement with SUNTRACS with content identical to that contained in the agreement signed between SUNTRACS and CAPAC. The Committee also notes that CAPAC indicated that it is an employers' organization that brings together the leading companies in the construction sector; that, since , it has negotiated ten collective labour agreements with SUNTRACS that regulate labour relations between CAPAC members, which are generalist and specialist contractors, and their workers; and all such agreements were negotiated in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code.
.The Committee observes that, according to the complainant organization s allegations, SUNTRACS sought to impose the terms of its collective labour agreement with CAPAC on the workers of a CAPAC-affiliated mining project contractor. According to the complainant, this would not be legally viable since the company already has a collective agreement with the STM that covers these workers. In this respect, the Committee recalls that systems of collective bargaining with exclusive rights for the most representative trade union and those where it is possible for a number of collective agreements to be concluded by a number of trade unions within a company are both compatible with the principles of freedom of association [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ].
.As regards the allegations of violent actions by SUNTRACS, while the Committee observes that the complainant organization has sent a link to various articles published in the press that indicate that SUNTRACS violently entered the company s premises, these and other press articles also indicate that STM-affiliated workers who wanted SUNTRACS to withdraw from the project had protested violently against SUNTRACS members, preventing them from accessing the company s premises. In this regard, the Committee recalls that trade union organizations should conduct themselves responsibly and respect the peaceful manner in which the right of assembly should be exercised [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ].
.The Committee observes that both cases contain allegations of favouritism on the part of the Government towards one trade union organization or the other. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that it cannot intervene in the dispute between SUNTRACS and the STM and that it laments the fact that the complaints have not been discussed in the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints, a commission established in the scope of the Panama Tripartite Agreement that seeks to resolve cases with consensual solutions.
.The Committee observes that the information and documentation submitted in both cases demonstrate that the Government, through MITRADEL, has acted as a mediator in numerous disputes within the company, has facilitated the signing of agreements and has proved that the company has breached",-1,2018,Panama
14,"some points of such agreements. The information and documentation submitted in both cases does not lead the Committee to conclude that there has been any favouritism or special treatment of either trade union organization by the Government.
.In the light of the above, and given that several matters raised in the complaints appear to be recurring and unresolved issues, the Committee invites the Government to seek to foster a climate of dialogue and trust when interacting with the trade unions concerned and the company, against a backdrop of trade union pluralism, to help to maintain harmonious labour relations within the company. To this end, the Committee encourages the Government to redouble its efforts towards dialogue and conciliation and to examine, together with the organizations and the company, the issues raised with a view to reaching agreements that overcome these challenges with the support of tripartite dialogue forums within the country.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee expects that the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development (MITRADEL), as a facilitator of and signatory to the agreements signed between the trade unions and the company, will take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with the agreements in question.(b)	The Committee expects that the courts will shortly rule on the pending judicial proceedings relating to the reinstatement of the workers and that the decisions issued will be respected.(c)	The Committee invites the Government to seek to foster a climate of dialogue and trust when interacting with the trade unions concerned and the company, against a backdrop of trade union pluralism, to help to maintain harmonious labour relations within the company. To this end, the Committee encourages the Government to redouble its efforts towards dialogue and conciliation and to examine, together with the organizations and the company, the issues raised with a view to reaching agreements that overcome these challenges with the support of tripartite dialogue forums within the country.",-1,2018,Panama
15,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  January  from the National Confederation of United Independent Unions (CONUSI).
.The Government of Panama sent its observations regarding the allegations in communications dated  October  and  August .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  January , CONUSI denounced the anti-union dismissal of  workers from the company, Copa Airlines (hereinafter the  airline company' , and members of the National Trade Union of Workers in the Aviation, Logistics, Similar and Related Industries (SIELAS) in retaliation for their participation in a strike. The complainant organization specifically states that (i) on  August , SIELAS submitted to the labour administration a draft renewal of the collective agreement for its referral to the airline company; (ii) negotiations for a draft collective agreement took place from  September to  October , with no interest demonstrated by the company in pursuing the discussions beyond the indicated date; (iii) in light of the absence of results and in compliance with the requirements established by section  of the Labour Code, on  November , SIELAS called a strike for  November; (iv) the call for a strike contributed to the resumption of negotiations, which made it possible to reach, on  November, agreement on several matters, although no consensus was achieved on the main financial clauses of the collective agreement; (v) at  a.m. on  November, a strike was initiated, as planned, and shortly after, labour inspectors arrived and stated, without providing any evidence, that the collective dispute had been referred for compulsory arbitration; (vi) in the absence of official notification to the trade union s general secretary of the ministerial decision ordering compulsory arbitration, the workers did not lift the strike; (vii) on the same day, the president of the company proposed immediately resuming discussions with the trade union, which made it possible to reach an agreement on the unresolved issues; the president indicated that it was not necessary to include a non-retaliation agreement, as no acts of retaliation would be carried out by the company; (viii) as a result of the agreement, the strike was lifted at . p.m. on the same day ( November), and the Ministry of Labour and Employment Development (MITRADEL) issued Decision No.  DGT  annulling the compulsory arbitration which, in reality, had never entered into force for the reasons indicated above; (ix) as the trade union did not trust the statements made by the president of the company regarding non-retaliation, on  November, it submitted a statement against the company with regard to Labour Code violations, to ensure the protection of workers against dismissal, provided for by law in such circumstances; (x) on  November , the president of the company dismissed  workers for their participation in the strike held on  November, which was qualified as illegal by the company despite the lack of a court ruling in that regard; and (xi) following the strike and the dismissals, the airline company brought the matter before the courts to request that the strike be declared illegal, which was denied by a court of first instance (ruling of  December  of the Second Local Labour Court). On the basis of the above, the complainant organization denounces the anti-union nature of the  dismissals and requests the reinstatement of the workers concerned.
.In an initial communication dated  October , the Government refers to the collective dispute between SIELAS and the airline company. In this regard, the Government states that: (i) the parties submitted their complaint to MITRADEL in order to comply with the conciliation proceedings, established in section  et seq. of the Labour Code; (ii) it is correct that the parties complied with the requirements and terms of the law, until the end of the proceedings; (iii) as no consensus was reached on the renewal of the collective agreement, a strike was called for  November  at  a.m., and (iv) subsequently, MITRADEL ordered compulsory arbitration. The Government adds in this regard that, in the case of enterprises providing public services, it is permissible to order compulsory arbitration, in accordance with sections ,  and  of the Labour Code. It also states that such a situation has precedent and has been recognized by the trade unions themselves.
.Concerning the dismissals following the strike, the Government: (i) states that it is not competent to examine complaints regarding these dismissals, and that such competence lies within the remit of conciliation and decision boards and the courts; (ii) noted the concern expressed by the complainant organization and offered its assistance for the defence of their rights; and (iii) will request the labour courts to provide information on the dismissal cases brought before them.
.By means of a second communication dated  August , the Government indicates that the Directorate General of Conciliation and Decision Boards, attached to MITRADEL, has in its archives only three files on the dismissals following the strike on  November , and that it therefore has no information on the status of the other dismissed workers. The Government indicates in this regard that: (i) in the labour proceedings for unjustified dismissal brought on  January  by Mr Jess Abdiel Villarreal del Cid, Board Number  recognized the claim in its final ruling, and ordered the airline company to pay , Panamanian balboas (equivalent to US$,); as the parties accepted the arrangement, the file was archived; (ii) in the labour proceedings for unjustified dismissal brought on  January  by Mr Abraham Isaac Sols Botacio, Board Number  handed down a favourable ruling to the worker and ordered the payment of ,. balboas in his favour; the airline company appealed the decision before the Higher Labour Court, which annulled the board s decision and decided to acquit the company; and (iii) during the labour proceedings for unjustified dismissal brought on  January  by Mr Eduardo Alberto Guardo Ortega, the board acquitted the company; the worker appealed the decision, which was overturned by the Higher Labour Court, and the payment of ,. balboas to the worker was ordered by the Higher Labour Court.
.The Committee observes that, in this case, the complainant organization denounces the dismissal of  workers from an airline company in retaliation for their participation in a strike held by SIELAS on  November .
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization specifically alleges that: (i) after having unsuccessfully negotiated the renewal of the collective agreement with the airline company, SIELAS, in compliance with the requirements established by the Labour Code regarding strikes in public services, announced that it would hold a strike on  November ; (ii) shortly after the beginning of the strike, officials from the labour inspectorate indicated to the strikers that MITRADEL had referred the dispute for compulsory arbitration and had ordered the end of the strike; (iii) in the absence of official notification of the ministerial decision ordering compulsory arbitration to the trade union general secretary, the strike continued; (iv) on the same day, the president of the airline company proposed that discussions on the collective agreement be resumed, which allowed for an agreement to be reached, and consequently the strike was ended at . p.m. on  November; (v) on  November , despite having promised that there would be no retaliation, the airline company dismissed  workers for participating in an allegedly illegal strike; (vi) following the dismissals, the airline company filed a request with the courts calling for the strike to be declared illegal; and (vii) by means of a ruling of  December , a court of first instance denied the request by the company.
.The Committee also notes the Government s statement that: (i) as part of the negotiations for the renewal of the collective agreement, the parties engaged in conciliation proceedings and complied with the requirements established by the Labour Code; (ii) after failing to reach consensus on the renewal of the collective agreement, SIELAS called a strike for  November  at  a.m.; (iii) once the strike had begun, MITRADEL issued, on  November , a compulsory arbitration decision, as permitted under the Labour Code with regard to collective disputes concerning public services, and (iv) on the same day, MITRADEL revoked the aforementioned compulsory arbitration decision, as an agreement had been reached between the parties and the strike had been ended. Regarding the dismissals, the Committee notes that the Government: (i) states that conciliation and decision boards and labour courts are the competent bodies to settle complaints in this respect; (ii) MITRADEL made its advisory services available to the trade union for the protection of the union s rights, and (iii) provides information on three individual cases of workers who brought action for unjustified dismissal, two of whom obtained favourable rulings in the form of compensation, and one who obtained an unfavourable ruling.
.The",0,2018,Panama
16,"Committee duly notes these elements. The Committee observes that it is apparent from the above, and from the documents submitted as annexes by the parties, that: (i) as indicated by the Government, and as referred to in Decision No. - issued by MITRADEL, the strike began on  November , after the requirements established by the legislation had been fulfilled; (ii) once the strike had begun, MITRADEL adopted a decision by means of which it decreed compulsory arbitration and ordered the workers to return to their duties; (iii) the strike continued throughout the day and finished on  November at . p.m, after an agreement had been reached between the parties; (iv) in both the first instance (ruling of  December  of the Second Local Labour Court, submitted by the complainant organization) and the second instance (ruling of  April  of the Higher Labour Court, referred to by the Higher Labour Court in one of the rulings on the dismissal of a worker, which was submitted by the Government), the courts did not formally declare that the strike had been illegal, as they considered that the strike had ended following the decision issued by MITRADEL, which ordered compulsory arbitration. However, the courts did consider that, at that point, the work stoppage became a  de facto suspension of activities'  (v) the (three) dismissals of workers, for which the Committee has the dismissal letters and the corresponding court rulings, were carried out on the grounds of the participation of the workers in the strike held on  November  even after the decision issued by MITRADEL, which ordered compulsory arbitration and the end of the strike; (vi) similarly, the rulings submitted by the Government, which validated the dismissals, were based on the fact that the workers in question did not comply, on that day, with the orders to return to work given by the company, following the aforementioned decision issued by MITRADEL, and (vii) the rulings submitted by the Government, which upheld the action brought for unjustified dismissal, were based on a consideration that the participation of the workers concerned in the strike had not been demonstrated.
.Regarding the strike initiated by SIELAS and the decision adopted by MITRADEL ordering compulsory arbitration and the end of the aforementioned strike, the Committee recalls that it has considered that compulsory arbitration to end a collective labour dispute and a strike is acceptable if it is at the request of both parties involved in a dispute, or if the strike in question may be restricted, even banned, i.e. in the case of disputes in the public service involving public servants exercising authority in the name of the State or in essential services in the strict sense of the term, namely those services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee also considered that in as far as compulsory arbitration prevents strike action, it is contrary to the right of trade unions to organize freely their activities and could only be justified in the public service or in essential services in the strict sense of the term [see Compilation, para. ].
.The Committee observes that, in this case, the Government referred to the public service nature of air transport, but did not mention the potential impact of the aforementioned strike on the life, health or safety of the whole or part of the population. The Committee also notes that the three dismissal cases for which it received detailed information from the complainant organization and the Government, concerned workers engaged in the land-based operations of the airline company. The Committee recalls that, in its conclusions adopted in other cases relating to the air transport sectors of other countries, it considered that, based on the specific circumstances of each case, the air transport sector as a whole is not an essential public service in the strict sense. The Committee also highlights that it has considered that the establishment of minimum services in the case of strike action should only be possible in: () services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population (essential services in the strict sense of the term); () services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term but where the extent and duration of a strike might be such as to result in an acute national crisis endangering the normal living conditions of the population; and () public services of fundamental importance [see Compilation, para. ]. In this respect, the Committee also considered that transportation of passengers and commercial goods is not an essential service in the strict sense of the term; however, this is a public service of primary importance where the requirement of a minimum service in the event of a strike can be justified [see Compilation, para. ].
.In light of the above, the Committee requests the Government to take, in consultation with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations, the necessary measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that the rules on compulsory arbitration meet the criteria indicated above, in such a way that they do not unduly limit the exercise of the right to strike and collective bargaining in the air transport sector.
.Concerning the alleged dismissal of  workers who participated in the strike action, the Committee recalls that no one should be penalized for carrying out or attempting to carry out a legitimate strike, and when trade unionists or union leaders are dismissed because of a strike, the Committee can only conclude that they have been punished for their trade union activities and have been discriminated against [see Compilation, paras  and ]. Observing that it only received specific information on the dismissal of three workers, the Committee: (i) requests the complainant organization to contact the Government in order to provide it with the full list of the workers who were allegedly dismissed for their participation in the strike; and (ii) requests the Government to, in light of the conclusions of this case, take the necessary measures to ensure that the workers dismissed for having participated in the aforementioned strike, are not punished for the legitimate exercise of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to take, in consultation with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations, the necessary measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that the rules on compulsory arbitration meet the above criteria indicated in the conclusions of this case, in such a way that they do not unduly limit the exercise of the right to strike and collective bargaining in the air transport sector. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b)	The Committee: (i) requests the complainant organization to contact the Government to provide it with the full list of the workers who were allegedly dismissed for having participated in the strike, and (ii) requests the Government to, in the light of the conclusions of this case, take the necessary measures to ensure that the workers dismissed for having participated in the aforementioned strike, are not punished for the legitimate exercise of freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",-1,2018,Panama
17,".The complaint is contained in communications from the National Confederation of United Independent Unions (CONUSI) dated  January and  May  and communications from the National Confederation of Workers of Panama (CNTP) dated  May  and  March .
.The Government sent its reply in communications dated  October  and  May .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  January and  May , CONUSI reports that a series of trade unions, mainly from the public sector, were unjustifiably refused the granting of legal personality. CONUSI states, firstly, that in May , the National Union of Garbage Collection Workers (SINTAURDO) sent the President of the Republic the decision of the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development (MITRADEL) granting it legal personality, in order for the President to sign it, but up until the date of the submission of the complaint, he had not yet done so. CONUSI goes on to indicate that, in September , the Union of Workers of the Social Insurance Fund (SINTRACSS) submitted corrected documentation for its request for registration, as ordered by MITRADEL; however, up until the date of the submission of the complaint the executive body had not yet issued a decision to grant it legal personality. The complainant organization also states that on  October  the Union of Workers of the Ministry of Public Works (SINTRAMOP) presented a request for legal personality. On  November  it presented the documents containing the corrections ordered in MITRADEL s decision of October . On  April , MITRADEL issued a decision not to accept the request to grant legal personality to the trade union organization, indicating that while it had submitted the statute reform document, it had not submitted the list of the trade union members who had attended the general assembly. On  April , SINTRAMOP filed an application for reconsideration against the above-mentioned decision, alleging primarily that the refusal to grant legal personality had been issued six months and  days after the request for registration was made, while, on the one hand, article  of the Political Constitution stipulates a non-extendable period of  days within which to allow or reject the registration of a trade union, and, on the other, article  of the Labour Code indicates that if more time passes than is established for MITRADEL to object to the request for registration, the trade union organization shall consider itself to be registered for all legal purposes and the Ministry will be obliged to issue the respective documents and certifications. The organization adds that the Labour Code does not demand as a requirement for registration the submission of an attendance list; consequently MITRADEL is not authorized to demand a requirement that is not established by law.
.The complainant organization also adds that despite the non-extendable deadlines established in article  of the Political Constitution and article  of the Labour Code, the executive body did not issue any decision despite more than  days having passed since the submission of the request for registration of the following trade unions: the Trade Union of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (SITRAMEF), the Trade Union of the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development (SITRAMITRADEL), the Trade Union of the Ministry of Health, and the Trade Union of the Instructors of the National Institute of Vocational Training and Human Development. The complainant organization also states that the same situation holds true for requests for legal personality made by private-sector trade unions and federations.
.In a communication dated  May , the CNTP associates itself with the complaint, alleging the failure to grant legal personality to a series of public sector trade unions. Further to those organizations already indicated by CONUSI, the CNTP also refers to the Trade Union of the Panama Maritime Authority and the Trade Union of the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic. CONUSI states that the failure to register the above-mentioned trade union organizations, following the granting of legal personality to a couple of state trade unions, would appear to demonstrate the Government's intention to start denying freedom of association in the public sector again, thus violating Convention No. , despite the constitutional status that the plenary session of the Supreme Court of Justice accorded this Convention in its ruling of  December .
.In a communication dated  March , the CNTP submitted new allegations and additional information, alleging the violation of Convention No.  on the grounds of the failure to grant legal personality and the certification of a series of trade unions, from both the public and private sectors. In addition to the trade unions indicated in the three previous communications, the CNTP also refers to the following trade unions: the Trade Union of the Fire Service of the Republic of Panama (SINBORPA), the Industrial Trade Union of Dockworkers and Allied Workers of Panama (UNISITRAPOPAS), the Union of Environmental Workers (UTRAM), the Trade Union of Professionals, Salaried Employees and Similar Workers (SIPAS), the Trade Union of National Education Workers (SITEN), the Trade Union of Dance Artistes of Panama (SADANPA), and the Union of Christian Construction Industry and Allied Workers (UTRACICS). The CNTP states that a number of these trade unions submitted requests for legal personality over a year ago and that the corresponding decisions granting them that personality have not yet been issued; others have been informed that their requests are being processed; and further trade unions have had their requests for legal personality rejected, despite complying with all requirements. In other cases, MITRADEL has indicated to the trade unions that the decisions granting them legal personality have been with the Office of the President of the Republic since  pending signature.
.In its communication of  October , the Government sent its observations indicating that: (i) it respects the provisions of ratified ILO Conventions relating to freedom of association; (ii) with ILO support the country has a policy of tripartite dialogue aimed at promoting the effective implementation of Conventions Nos  and  through the committees set up in the framework of the Panama Tripartite Agreement; (iii) the current Government administration has to date granted legal personality to  trade union organizations; (iv) the right to organize of public sector workers has been recognized; (v) SINTAURDO was granted legal personality by way of decision No.  of  and SITRAMITRADEL by way of decision No.  of ; (vi) with respect to the requests for legal personality made by SINTRACSS, the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Health (SITRAMINSA), SINTRAMOP and SITRAMEF, the Government indicates that these requests are pending before the Office of the President of the Republic at the admissibility stage; (vii) with respect to the alleged request for legal personality made by the Trade Union of the Instructors of the Institute of Vocational Training and Human Development, the Government states that there is no request for registration filed under that name in the archives of the Department of Social Organizations, however, another trade union organization exists under the name of the National Trade Union of Administrative, Technical and Teaching Workers of the National Institute of Vocational Training and Training for Human Development (SINTRAINADEH), the legal personality of which was recognized by way of decision No.  of ; and (viii) the Government, as well as issuing the decisions granting legal personality to the above-mentioned trade unions, also issues the respective certifications.
.By a communication dated  May , the Government states that through the adoption of four resolutions on  May , the following trade unions were granted legal personality: the Union of Workers of the Social Insurance Fund (SINTRACSS); (ii) the Union of Workers of the Ministry of Health (SITRAMINSA); (iii) the Union of the Fire Service of the Republic of Panama (SINBORPA); and (iv) the Union of Workers of the Ministry of Public Works (SINTRAMOP). The Government states that the foregoing confirms that the provisions of ILO Conventions ratified by Panama are respected, especially with regard to freedom of association, and expressly requests that the case be closed.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations denounce the failure to grant legal personality and certification of registration to a series of trade unions, mostly from the public sector, that were in one of the following situations: (i) trade unions that had allegedly submitted, in some cases over a year previously, requests for legal personality, for which MITRADEL had not yet handed down a decision, irrespective of the provisions of the Constitution and the Labour Code, which stipulate a deadline of  days for the public authorities to hand down a decision on requests for legal personality; (ii) trade unions that had had their requests for legal personality rejected, despite complying with all requirements; and (iii) trade unions for which the decisions granting them legal personality were allegedly pending signature in the Office of the President of",0,2018,Panama
18,"the Republic. The Committee notes that, according to the complainant organizations, the alleged facts demonstrate the Government s intention to start denying freedom of association in the public sector again.
.The Committee notes that, in its first communication of  October , the Government states that: (i) it respects the provisions of ratified ILO Conventions relating to freedom of association and, with ILO support, it has a policy of tripartite dialogue aimed at promoting the effective implementation of Conventions Nos  and  through the committees set up in the framework of the Panama Tripartite Agreement; (ii) since taking up its functions it has granted legal personality to  trade union organizations; (iii) the right to organize of public sector workers has been recognized; (iv) it has already granted legal personality to a number of trade unions cited in the complaint; and (v) other requests for legal personality mentioned in the complaint are pending before the Office of the President of the Republic at the admissibility stage. The Committee also notes that, in its communication of  May , the Government states that on  May , four public sector trade union organizations were granted legal personality.
.The Committee notes these various elements and observes that the trade union organizations mentioned in CONUSI s allegations and in the initial allegations from the CNTP are public sector trade unions. The Committee recalls that on a number of occasions in the past it has already examined allegations relating to Panama and the refusal by the administrative authority to grant legal personality to trade unions of public servants [see Case No. , th (), th (), th () and th () Reports; Case No. , th Report, ; and Case No. , st () and th () Reports]. In line with the Government s statement and in reference to the previous paragraph, the Committee recalls that in the most recent case, after having asked the Government to amend the Public Administration Careers Act to ensure that the National Union of Education Workers (SINTE) may obtain legal personality and be registered as a trade union [see st Report, , paras  ], it had: (i) noted with satisfaction that SINTE had obtained legal personality in April ; and (ii) noted with interest the preparation of a draft bill on collective relations in the public sector to address the observations of the ILO supervisory bodies in relation to the implementation of Conventions Nos  and . In the present case, the Committee takes due note that the Government: (i) states that it recognizes the right to organize of public sector workers; (ii) on  December  granted legal personality to SINTAURDO and SITRAMITRADEL, two public sector workers' organizations; the certifications of legal personality of both organizations were issued on  October ; and (iii) on  May  granted legal personality to the trade unions SINTRACSS, SITRAMINSA, SINBORPA and SINTRAMOP.
.The Committee takes note with satisfaction the above-mentioned granting of legal personality to six public sector trade union organizations. The Committee welcomes the fact that these decisions confirm and strengthen the dynamic of the recognition of the public sector trade union organizations mentioned in the previous paragraph. At the same time, the Committee observes that the above-mentioned processes of granting legal personality and of certifying were drawn out over several months. In this respect, recalling that a one-year period for treating a union s application for registration is excessive and not conducive to harmonious industrial relations [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ], the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures, particularly in the public sector, to ensure that in future the process for registering trade union organizations occurs expeditiously.
.With respect to the remaining requests for legal personality made by public sector trade union organizations mentioned in the complaint, the Committee observes that, for some of them, the Government s reply does not provide any information (the Trade Union of the Panama Maritime Authority and the Trade Union of the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic), while for the SITRAMEF the Government states that the request is pending before the Office of the President of the Republic at the admissibility stage. The Committee recalls that although the registration procedure very often consists of a mere formality, there are a number of countries in which the law confers on the competent authorities more or less discretionary powers in deciding whether or not an organization meets all the conditions required for registration, thus creating a situation which is similar to that in which previous authorization is required. Similar situations can arise where a complicated and lengthy registration procedure exists, or where the competent administrative authorities may exercise their powers with great latitude; these factors are such as to create a serious obstacle for the establishment of a trade union and lead to a denial of the right to organize without previous authorization [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. In the light of the foregoing and encouraged by the recent granting of legal personality to four public sector trade union organizations, the Committee trusts that the Government, in consultation with the organizations concerned and in full respect of the right of trade unions to establish themselves without previous authorization, will take the measures necessary for the recognition and certification of the legal personality of the organizations concerned to occur at the earliest possible opportunity. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Recalling once again the conclusions it adopted regarding Case No.  concerning the necessary alignment of the Public Administration Careers Act with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining, the Committee also emphasizes that, as referred to by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its observation published in  on the implementation of Convention No.  by Panama, the Committee on the alignment of national legislation with ILO Conventions prepared, in a tripartite manner, the bill on collective labour relations in the public sector. The Committee observes that this bill establishes, among other measures, that all public servants may establish trade union organizations, without the need for previous authorization. Noting that the bill was submitted in the second half of  for debate before the National Assembly, the Committee trusts that legislation to regulate the establishment, registration and functioning of public sector trade unions in accordance with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining will be adopted at the earliest opportunity. The Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.With respect to the alleged lack of response from the executive body to the request for legal personality made by the Trade Union of the Instructors of the National Institute of Vocational Training and Human Development, the Committee notes the Government s statement that there is no request for registration filed under that name in the archives of the Department of Social Organizations, although it does report that another trade union organization exists under the name of the National Trade Union of Administrative, Technical and Teaching Workers of the National Institute of Vocational Training and Training for Human Development (SINTRAINADEH), the legal personality of which was recognized by way of decision No.  of  February . Observing that the name of the trade union organization to which the Government refers differs from the name mentioned by the complainant organizations in their complaint, the Committee invites the complainant organization to indicate whether the trade union to which legal personality has been granted is the same as the one to which it refers in its allegations and, if it is not, to provide the Government with more details on the request for legal personality referred to in the complaint.
.Observing, finally, that in a communication dated  March , the CNTP submitted, in addition to the complaint regarding the non-registration of the SINBORPA, with respect to which the Government has informed of the granting of its legal personality, allegations relating to the failure to register another six trade union organizations, from both the public and the private sectors, the Committee requests the Government to promptly send its comments in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Encouraged by the recent granting of legal personality to four public sector trade union organizations, the Committee trusts that the Government, in consultation with the organizations concerned and in full respect of the right of trade unions to establish themselves without previous authorization, will take the measures necessary for the recognition and certification of the legal personality of the following organizations to occur at the earliest possible opportunity: the Trade Union of the Panama Maritime Authority, the Trade Union of the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic, and the Trade Union of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (SITRAMEF). The Committee requests the Government to keep it",1,2018,Panama
19,"informed in this respect.(b)	The Committee trusts that legislation to regulate the establishment, registration and functioning of public sector trade unions will be adopted at the earliest opportunity in accordance with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.(c)	With respect to the request for legal personality made by the Trade Union of the Instructors of the National Institute of Vocational Training and Human Development, observing that the name of the trade union organization to which the Government refers differs from the name mentioned by the complainant organizations in their complaint, the Committee invites the complainant organization to indicate whether the trade union to which legal personality has been granted is the same as the one to which it refers in its complaint and, if it is not, to provide the Government with more details on the request for legal personality referred to in the complaint.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to promptly send its comments regarding the allegations relating to the failure to register six trade union organizations contained in the communication from the National Confederation of Workers of Panama (CNTP) dated  March .",1,2018,Panama
20,".The complaint is contained in a communication of  July  signed by the National Union of Workers of Construction and Similar Industries (UNTRAICS).
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  February,  May and  June .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July , the complainant organization alleges that the elections for the new executive committee of the Autonomous Trade Union Confederation of Panamanian Workers (CGTP ' the confederation to which the complainant is affiliated), which were held on  May  during the ninth ordinary congress of the CGTP, were undemocratic because of interference by the public authorities, through high-ranking government officials. In this regard, the complainant organization reports that: (i) Mr Samuel Rivera, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development, who at the time of the CGTP elections was temporarily holding the office of Deputy Labour Minister under Decree No.  of  May , participated in the trade union elections as a candidate on the list that emerged victorious and was elected as an officer (Executive Secretary) of the CGTP national executive committee; and (ii) another Ministry of Labour official, Mr Rolando Glvez, a safety inspector at the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development, was imposed on the CGTP as Organizational and Statistics Secretary. The complainant organization considers that these acts of interference, and the introduction of other high-ranking civil servants who were formerly trade union officials but are now employed by the Government, demonstrate that the Government has sought to exert influence over the CGTP, undermining its independence and autonomy. Moreover, the complainant indicates that article  of the CGTP constitution provides that any CGTP officer who is appointed to a political position or position of authority in any government institution must request leave of absence from the executive committee to occupy such a position and the officer s deputy will take over his/her duties.
.The complainant organization indicates that the documentation of the ninth ordinary congress of the CGTP was registered on  June  at . p.m. by the president of the ordinary congress ' who, according to the complainant, is not empowered to do this under the CGTP rules, let alone to submit the documentation to the Department of Social Organizations at the Ministry of Labour, which answers to the Office of the Secretary- General of that Ministry, where Mr Rivera officiates. The complainant also explains that the person who headed the victorious list of candidates in the elections, Ms Nelva Reyes, holds union office as the General Secretary of the Democratic Teachers' Association of Panama, but bizarrely she appeared in the documentation as being accredited with the Federation of Peasant Farmers (FITA). The complainant indicates that, despite these flaws and irregularities, the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development completed the relevant process and approved the new executive committee in the surprisingly short time of eight and a half hours, which is incomprehensible to the complainant given the size of the case file and the number of documents that the Department in question receives on a daily basis. The complainant indicates that it challenged the elections in the courts ' questioning the direct interference of the Government through high-ranking officials in order to place the CGTP at the service of the Government ' and that, as a result of this action, government officials published statements tarnishing the image of the complainant organization (the complainant submits a press article criticizing its position on the elections, signed by a former CGTP General Secretary who, according to the complainant, is now a government adviser). Lastly, the complainant indicates that it informed the President of the Republic in writing of the alleged violations of freedom of association.
.In its communications of  February and  May , the Government responds to the allegations made by the complainant organization.
.The Government indicates that there was no interference by the government authorities in the election of the new executive committee of the CGTP. The Government reports that, while it is true that Mr Rivera is the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development, it is also true that he has been a CGTP member since  and that in  he was elected Finance Secretary, a post that he still holds. The Government indicates that in July  Mr Rivera was appointed Secretary-General of the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development; that since then his involvement in CGTP activities has decreased; and that on  and  May , the dates of the elections of the ninth congress of the CGTP, Mr Rivera requested to be relieved of his public office from the Ministry in order to present the finance report to the CGTP congress. The Government also states that, in accordance with the provisions of article  of the CGTP by-laws, by a request of  June , Mr Rivera asked the Board of the CGTP to relieve him of his position as Executive Secretary of the trade union in order to hold public office. The Government provides the document according to which, on  July , the Secretary-General of the CGTP relieved Mr Rivera of his trade union office as requested. As regards the allegation that Mr Glvez was imposed on the CGTP, the Government indicates that since  July  he has been a member of the Union of Workers of the Panamanian Plastics Industry (SITIPP), which is affiliated to the CGTP and that, just as Mr Rivera, Mr Glvez requested and was relieved from his position in the trade union to hold public office.
.As regards the registration of the documentation of the ninth ordinary congress of the CGTP by the congress President, the Government states that: (i) congress sessions are governed by an executive body and, once the discussion of the documents is complete, an electoral tribunal is established which is responsible for conducting the electoral process, as set out in the union rules; (ii) Mr Efrn Delgado (independent), Mr Victor Concepcin (non-member officer) and Mr ngel Lpez (non-member officer) were responsible for the running of the congress; (iii) two lists of candidates were presented for the elections of the ninth congress, at which the list headed by Ms Nelva Reyes emerged victorious, and the outcome was registered with the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development once the official record had been signed; (iv) it is incorrect that the Department of Social Organizations answers to the Office of the Secretary-General of the Ministry, since it is under the Directorate-General of Labour; and (v) as regards the time taken to certify the new executive committee, the documentation was duly presented and the Ministry was therefore obliged to register it in order to avoid differences between trade unions.
.The Government indicates that the defeated list of candidates challenged the elections in the First Labour Court of the First Sector, which issued ruling No.  of  June , rejecting the appeal as inadmissible. The Government adds that an appeal was filed with the Higher Labour Court of the First Judicial District, which upheld the rejection of the appeal by the First Labour Court in a ruling of  July . The court decisions forwarded by the Government show that both judicial bodies considered that the complainants had not met the legal requirements for challenging the acts of a trade union confederation, and so the appeal was rejected without entering into the substance.
.The Committee observes that the complaint concerns allegations of interference by the Government in trade union elections to gain control of the CGTP. The Committee observes that the complainant organization indicates, without being contradicted by the Government, that at least two government officials participated in the ninth congress and in the elections of the CGTP and that the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development was appointed Executive Secretary of the CGTP national executive committee. The Committee notes from the Government: (i) the indication that the government officials concerned had been active trade union members for some time and that, as regards the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development, his involvement in CGTP activities had been decreasing since his appointment to the Ministry in ; and (ii) the indication that, according to the CGTP by-laws, the Secretary-General of the Ministry sought to be relieved of his union position of Executive Secretary to exercise his public office and the union acceded to his request, so that the Committee understands that he is currently not exercising any trade union office. The Committee also notes from the information provided by the Government that: (i) in the past, the Secretary-General of the Ministry continued to hold the position of Finance Secretary in the CGTP after his appointment to the Ministry; and (ii) during the period for which he was temporarily appointed as Deputy Minister, he requested to be relieved of his public office from",0,2015,Panama
21,"the Ministry to participate in the ninth congress of the CGTP, at which he was elected Executive Secretary by virtue of being on the victorious candidate list.
.Firstly, the Committee wishes to recall the general principle that the Committee is not competent to make recommendations on internal dissentions within a trade union organization, so long as the government does not intervene in a manner which might affect the exercise of trade union rights and the normal functioning of an organization [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. Secondly, the Committee wishes to draw attention to the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which recalls that it is essential to preserve the freedom and independence of the trade union movement in all countries so that it can pursue its economic and social objectives regardless of any political changes. As regards the allegations of interference, the Committee considers that the participation of high-ranking officials of the public administration in trade union elections or in positions of trade union leadership can undermine the independence of the trade union organizations in question.
.With regard to the case, the Committee observes that, by virtue of the CGTP by-laws, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Labour and Social Development and the safety inspectors had requested to be relieved of their trade union office to hold public office and that the trade union acceded to these requests, thereby addressing the potential risk of conflict of interest.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to consider that this case does not call for further examination.",1,2015,Panama
22,".The Committee last examined this case at its October  meeting and on that occasion made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee requests the Government, in light of all the statistics on the length of the proceedings established as compensatory guarantees, including the frequency of appeals to the Supreme Court, to facilitate dialogue with the social partners in order to ensure the efficiency and rapidity of these procedures for dealing with complaints as compensatory guarantees. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(b)	The Committee invites the Government to facilitate dialogue between the competent authorities and the social partners on the existing representation privileges and their implementation in practice in light of the principles of freedom of association.
.In its communication of  May , the Government provided information and detailed documentation concerning these recommendations, pursuant to the inputs provided by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP).
.The Government notes the ACP s commitment to and engagement in social dialogue with the  trade unions present at the Canal, divided into six bargaining units. By law and according to regulations it is compulsory for the ACP to maintain an ongoing dialogue with the workers' organizations at the Canal, with a view to finding the best solutions for issues that arise or that might arise in the labour relations sphere and in respect of the Canal s operations. This can be seen, among other indicators, from the five collective agreements concluded in  and the two concluded in  (three of them with the complainant organizations the Union of Panama Canal Pilots (UPCP), the Union of Tugboat Captains and Officers (UCOC) and the Union of Marine Engineers (UIM)). Moreover, as set out in its organizational law, the ACP is in ongoing dialogue to reach supplementary agreements, in the form of memorandums of understanding and operative agreements. The ongoing dialogue is also evident in the participation of the unions in internal bodies, such as the labour anagement council, which meets once a month; the industrial training committee, which meets once every three months to deal with training matters; and the risk and occupational health supervisory committee, which meets once a month. These committees were set up to identify problems and find joint solutions. The Government states that, as part of this ongoing dialogue with the workers' organizations at the Canal, since the last time the Committee examined the case in November , the ACP has held  meetings with the various unions in the framework of the abovementioned committees.
.With regard to the proceedings established as compensatory guarantees, the Government provides detailed information as to how the various existing mechanisms work and also provides statistical data. This information shows that: (i) the proceedings are the result of social dialogue, as they are regulated by the collective agreements (each collective agreement, by agreement of the parties, regulates what is known as  the negotiated complaints procedure' ; (ii) concerning the effectiveness and rapidity of the proceedings, it is the parties which, of common accord, determine its modalities ' they even agree when the arbitrator will issue the award ' and the arbitration outcomes are usually issued within a short time frame of between  and  days (the delay in some cases is because claimants sometimes invoke the process but do not activate it ' by failing to nominate an arbitrator); (iii) with regard to the challenges brought before the Third Administrative Division of the Supreme Court of Justice (brought in the majority of cases by the bargaining units), they are generally settled in just under a year from the submission of the application; and (iv) on a general note, and with regard to the strengthening of dialogue, collective bargaining has resulted in the establishment of forums and workshops to strengthen ongoing dialogue with the trade unions ' for example the UCOC and the UIM ' in order to address matters relating to working conditions submitted to the administration.
.As regards the existing representation privileges and their implementation in practice, the Government notes that: (i) the applicable rules provide the guarantees necessary for the exercise of trade union representation, with privileges being set out in the respective collective agreements; (ii) for example, according to the provisions of the respective collective agreement, the bargaining unit of non-professional workers includes six district representatives who have eight hours a day, five days a week, to carry out their trade union activities ' in addition, this group has  area representatives and  substitutes for individual representation cases; (iii) in general quantitative terms, between the  tax year and April , the ACP approved a total of , hours of representation leave requested by trade union representatives from five of the six bargaining units (equivalent to over US$ million), in addition to, during the same period, , hours of representation leave requested by trade union representatives from the sixth bargaining unit ' of pilots (equivalent to US$,); (iv) the conditions for exercising these privileges are also agreed with the trade unions concerned in the corresponding collective agreements; and (v) these trade union privileges can be used in a flexible manner, with representatives being allowed to change their hours ' or agree changes with other workers ' in order to perform their representation tasks, subject simply to the authorization of their supervisor.
.The Committee takes due note of the detailed information provided by the Government on the various mechanisms available to promote ongoing social dialogue at the Canal, both in general ' illustrated by the conclusion of seven collective agreements since the submission of the complaint ' and in respect of the issues raised in the case. In particular, the Committee notes the direct participation of the social partners in the management of dispute settlement processes established as compensatory guarantees and their joint regulation by way of collective agreements, as well as the statistics relating to their operation. The Committee also notes the results of social dialogue in respect of representation privileges granted to workers' representatives ' agreed and regulated by way of collective agreement ' and their practical implementation. Moreover, the Committee observes that it has not received any further information from the complainant organizations since its last examination in . In light of the above, and trusting that the Government will continue to follow up the issues raised with the unions concerned to consider any relevant improvements, the Committee considers its examination to be concluded and will not pursue this case.
.The complaint is contained in communications dated  August and  November  from the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), the Union of Tugboat Captains and Officers (UCOC), the Union of Panama Canal Pilots (UPCP), the Union of Marine Engineers (UIM) and the Panama Canal and Caribbean Union (SCPC).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  February , and  October .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. )
.In their communications of  August and  November , the complainant organizations allege that the Government denies Panama Canal workers the right to strike, does not provide sufficient compensatory guarantees in that regard, hinders the exercise of privileges that should be enjoyed by workers' representatives, does not meet some of the commitments established in a collective agreement, imposes unilateral changes in working conditions, fails to bargain in good faith and victimizes trade unionists.
.The complainants maintain that Panama Canal workers do not have the right to strike. They state that section  of the Organic Act establishing the Panama Canal Authority (LOACP) classifies the Canal as an international public service and establishes that its operation may not be interrupted in whole or in part or diminished for any reason by strike action, go-slows or any other unjustified work stoppage. They emphasize that this prohibition is based on the fact that the Canal is viewed not as an  essential' service but as an international  public' service. They consider that the conditions necessary as stipulated by the Committee to totally deny Panama Canal workers the right to strike are not present.
.The complainants also allege that the compensatory guarantees for workers who have been deprived of the right to strike are insufficient. They indicate that the LOACP provides two avenues for addressing labour disputes in the Panama Canal zone, both of which limit the potential to appeal the resulting decisions or awards: (i) the Labour Relations Board (JRL), which is empowered to impose binding settlements of disputes on bargaining rights, break deadlocks in negotiations and address complaints of unfair labour practices (its decisions may not be appealed unless they violate the LOACP); and (ii) collective bargaining and the established conciliation and arbitration mechanisms (the resulting arbitral awards may only be appealed on the grounds of misinterpretation of a law or regulation, clear bias on the arbitrator s part or abuse of due process). The complainants report that although the LOACP places these restrictions on",0,2014,Panama
23,"the right of appeal, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has appealed all decisions and awards that were unfavourable to it before the Supreme Court. They allege that these appeals are brought for the sole purpose of delaying application of the decisions since the appeals proceedings can take up to five years and the ACP refuses to implement decisions until they have been confirmed by the Supreme Court. The complainants therefore consider that the compensatory guarantees for workers who have been denied the right to strike are insufficient and that this is contrary to the principles of freedom of association. In support of this allegation, they mention six cases: (i) Complaint No. / on unfair labour practices, brought before the JRL on  January , alleging failure to pay captains who had been required to report for work early without the usual prior notice as required under a collective agreement (on  February , the JRL ruled in favour of the UCOC; the ACP lodged an appeal immediately and the Supreme Court s decision is pending); (ii) Complaint No. / on unfair labour practices, brought before the JRL on  May , alleging failure to pay overtime to marine engineers pursuant to a collective agreement (on  July , the JRL ruled in favour of the UIM; the ACP lodged an appeal on  September , and the Supreme Court s decision is still pending); (iii) Complaint No. / on unfair labour practices, brought on  August , alleging failure to provide lunch boxes to marine engineers pursuant to a collective agreement (on  January , the JRL ruled in favour of the UIM; the ACP lodged an appeal on  June  and the Supreme Court s decision is still pending); (iv) a complaint, brought before the JRL on  April , alleging that captains had been excluded from the collective agreement between the UCOC and the ACP on the grounds that they were  trusted employees' (the JRL ruled in favour of the UCOC; the ACP lodged an appeal immediately and in April  the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the UCOC); (v) Complaint No. / on unfair labour practices, brought in , alleging failure to follow the procedures governing health care (on  March , the JRL ruled in favour of the UPCP; the Supreme Court s decision is still pending; and (vi) Arbitral Cases Nos / and /, alleging that the members of a bargaining unit had been denied access to ships whose operation required additional compensation (the hearings were held in July  and July ; the arbitrators ruled in favour of the UPCP, the ACP appealed and the Supreme Court s decision is still pending).
.The complainants further allege that the ACP puts obstacles in the way of the exercise of privileges by workers' representatives. They recall that the LOACP allocates workers' representation to an  exclusive representative'  defined as the trade union that represents the workers in a bargaining unit, and envisages  representation leave'  leave granted to the worker that the exclusive representative designates to represent it in a legally authorized activity. The complainants also report that, in December , the UCOC signed a Memorandum of Understanding, supplementing the provisions on representation, under which the three designated area representatives are granted a collective maximum of  hours of representation leave. The complainants report that, deliberately misinterpreting this Memorandum of Understanding in order to deny access to representation privileges: (i) the ACP denies the trade union organization s right to designate the representatives who are entitled to representation leave (in that regard, the complainants mention, as examples, Arbitration No. - on failure to grant representation leave to the General Secretary or the representative and legal adviser of a trade union, and disciplinary proceedings brought against two captains, in which the union representatives assigned to represent the workers in question were not granted representation leave); and (ii) in response to requests to hold meetings to be attended by other trade union representatives, the ACP maintained that workers' representatives could only be granted such leave when the meeting was organized by the ACP (and refused to grant such leave when the representatives organized a meeting pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding, although that restriction is not envisaged in the LOACP). In order to show the negative impact of limiting representation leave to the three area representatives, the complainants explain that the trade union assigns and distributes cases to trade union secretaries on the basis of the subject matter and does not assign them to area representatives. They also mention other events as examples of an attempt to hinder the exercise of privileges by workers' representatives, alleging that the ACP: (i) has begun to suggest that meetings should only be held on the trade union representative s rest days; (ii) has altered the duty roster to ensure that representatives and/or workers who have been subject to disciplinary hearings have only a short rest period between shifts and meetings; (iii) does not give line managers full authority to grant representation leave (as was the practice, and although it is the line managers who best understand needs as regards duty rosters and representation), requiring them to follow direct oral instructions from their superiors; and (iv) with regard to the mid-term negotiations envisaged in the collective agreement with the UPCP, the negotiating team was granted only  calendar days of official leave whereas the ACP negotiating team had been granted paid leave in which to prepare for more than a year. The complainants maintain that their representatives should be able to communicate with management without delay and should be granted the paid leave that they require in order to fulfil their representation responsibilities, and that the trade unions have the right to decide who their representatives will be and, in particular, who may exercise representation privileges.
.The complainants also maintain that the ACP is failing to meet some of the commitments established in collective agreements, imposing unilateral changes in working conditions and failing to bargain in good faith. With regard to relations between the Canal authorities and the UPCP, they report that, first, the ACP has denied the trade union s request for the joint development and implementation of a training programme for the Canal pilots who pilot ships through the new canals and locks, even though a Memorandum signed by the ACP and the UPCP on  May , which is part of the collective agreement with the UPCP, specifically provides for such joint preparation. The complainants state that the UPCP plans to bring proceedings against the ACP for unfair labour practices in this matter. Second, the complainants report that on  May , the ACP sent the UPCP written notification of changes in the current working conditions (and also future changes resulting from the opening of the third set of locks), implicitly denying the trade union s right to full negotiations on these changes in the conditions of employment, including the right to negotiate on ways and means of carrying out the work as established in the LOACP. Similarly, the complainants allege, with regard to the working conditions covered by the collective agreement, that: (i) section  of the agreement establishes that its provisions may only be reopened for negotiation by mutual agreement; and (ii) although the UPCP did not consent to such reopening, the ACP persisted in imposing new rules, leading the UPCP to bring proceedings for unfair practices before the JRL.
.With regard to relations between the authorities and the UCOC, the complainants report that the ACP has failed to bargain in good faith and that, for almost five years ' since December  ' the UCOC has been attempting to negotiate a new collective agreement but, despite those efforts, has been unable even to successfully negotiate the basic rules applicable to the negotiation of such an agreement. The complainants maintain that the negotiations on basic rules began in January  and that, after just a few meetings, it was clear that the ACP was not acting in good faith. Specifically, they allege that: (i) the UCOC was not granted representation leave in order to prepare; (ii) the captains involved in the negotiations were required to work their usual shifts and, at times, were forced to attend meetings without having had their compulsory rest periods; (iii) the members of the UCOC team were still required to work whenever it suited the ACP, interrupting the continuity of the negotiations (whereas the ACP team members were allowed to take time off to focus on the negotiations); (iv) the UCOC was not allowed to bring lawyers or other advisers to the bargaining table; (v) the ACP tripled the length of the short list of issues proposed by the trade union and added issues related to the negotiation of a collective agreement, not to the basic rules of negotiation; and (vi) the ACP team stated that it did not have decision-making power and was acting on the orders of senior",0,2014,Panama
24,"management. The complainants state that the negotiations on basic rules were terminated in September  and that the UCOC reported this deadlock to the JRL.
.Lastly, the complainants allege that the ACP victimizes trade unionists. They report that, on one occasion during the negotiations with the UCOC on the basic rules for negotiating a collective agreement, when the trade union team had been given, exceptionally, a week of representation leave, the negotiations were stalled after just one meeting and the ACP ordered the trade union team back to work. The complainants report that when that team s members refused to do so on the grounds that they had been granted representation leave, they immediately received written notification that they were subject to a disciplinary measure for failing to obey the order. The complainants add that, while the disciplinary measure was ultimately lifted, the show of force and the attitude displayed by the ACP added to the impression that management had no interest in negotiating a collective agreement with the UCOC.
.In its communications of  and  February , the Government sends its reply, which is based on the ACP s comments on the complainants' allegations.
.Concerning the allegation that Panama Canal workers are denied the right to strike, the Government recalls that it does not prevent workers from exercising this right; the labour policy in question was the outcome of a tripartite decision in which the trade unions (which included members of the four complainants) participated with full knowledge and which resulted in article  of the Constitution. In that regard, the Government emphasizes that, not only is the prohibition based on a provision of the LOACP, it is established in Panama s Constitution, article  of which establishes that because the Canal provides an essential international service, its operation may not be interrupted for any reason. On that point, the Government refers to the statement made by the representative of the Coalition of Panama Canal Workers' Unions (American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL CIO)) on  December , during the regular session of the Legislative Assembly of Panama, recognizing that  there is no right to strike at the Panama Canal and we, the members of the Coalition of Unions, are at no time calling for the right to strike to apply'  The Government adds that, in order not to leave the workers unprotected, it was proposed that labour disputes between Canal workers and the ACP be settled between the workers or their trade unions and the Administration using the dispute settlement mechanisms established by law, with arbitration as the final administrative remedy. The Government stresses that the LOACP was the outcome of countless consultations and of a consensus reached by the various political, civil, environmental and labour groups of Panamanian society with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The Government adds that this prohibition not only reflects a decision taken by the Panamanian people; it was confirmed by the three branches of Government. In that regard, the Government recalls that the Supreme Court considered the issue in its decision of  April , in which the plenary of the Court ruled that, while the right of workers to strike was constitutionally protected, it must be borne in mind that, following the principle of consistency with the provisions of the Constitution, priority must be given to uninterrupted provision of the essential public service that the Panama Canal provides, which is expressly enshrined in the Constitution. Lastly, the Government recalls that the provision of the Constitution on which the prohibition of strikes is based is consistent with Article II of the Treaty concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, which  declares the neutrality of the Canal in order that both in time of peace and in time of war it shall remain secure and open to peaceful transit by the vessels of all nations on terms of entire equality'  The Government explains that this commitment (which was signed by Panama and the United States on  September  and to which  States are parties) is the basis for the obligation to keep the Canal open without interruption. The Government emphasizes that this is not merely a service that may be interrupted without risk to life or personal safety; the stability of our societies, the sustainability of the global system that links them even more closely and, ultimately, peace itself depend on its provision. For this reason, the Government considers it to be a service of global interest.
.Concerning the allegation of insufficient compensatory guarantees, the Government maintains, first, that the complainants have neglected to state that, in addition to access to the JRL and to collective bargaining procedures, Canal workers have other compensatory guarantees, including the principle of security of tenure, the freedom of information system, the right of trade union organizations to membership in international trade union organizations, the right to the procedure for the handling of complaints and resulting arbitration, and the right to establish a labour-management council that includes the Administration and the trade unions in order to improve labour relations, identify problems and find solutions. The Government also explains that the number of cases in which the trade unions have exercised their right to appeal arbitral awards or rulings of the JRL is greater than the number in which the Administration, with equal legitimacy under the law, has appealed (in support of this claim, in its latest communication the Government provides detailed data on the number of cases on labour issues involving the ACP between  and , including the number of charges brought by each party:  by the ACP and  by the trade unions). The Government further indicates that in none of the cases to which the complainants allude have the Administration s appeals been brought at the whim of the ACP in an attempt to avoid implementing unfavourable decisions and to abuse the prohibition of strikes in the Canal zone; in every case, care was taken to respect both the guarantee of due process and the competency of the court and every appeal legitimately invoked violation of provisions of the law. Concerning the complaints of unfair practices (Nos /, / and /), the Government states that, under the law, the complaints did not concern unfair labour practices and should have been submitted for arbitration; thus, they were unlawfully judged receivable by the JRL. The Government was therefore obliged to appeal the rulings of the JRL in order to safeguard the integrity of the Canal s labour regime. The Government states that one of these cases (Complaint No. /) was settled by the Supreme Court on  February , in a decision annulling the ruling of the JRL on the grounds that the latter had not been competent to consider the complaint, which could not be treated as involving an unfair labour practice (the Government considers that this same criterion should apply to the other complaints of the same type (Nos / and /), which are still pending before the Supreme Court). With respect to the two arbitration cases, the Government reports that the Administration was also obliged to appeal the awards because it considered them unlawful (in one case because the arbitrator s remit had been exceeded by the ruling and in the other because the arbitrator had departed from the issue under consideration).
.With regard to the allegations of denial of representation privileges, the Government states that the ACP merely carried out its role of obeying and enforcing the law, collective agreements and memoranda of understanding between the parties in order to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the service provided by the Canal. The ACP considers that the new tugboat captains' union, the UCOC, disrupts the proper functioning of labour relations by encouraging non-compliance with existing agreements. In that connection, the ACP recalls that the Memorandum of Understanding that the UCOC signed in  establishes that only the three area representatives (designated by the trade union, one for each operational sector) are entitled to representation leave. For this reason, the ACP could not grant representation leave to other workers' representatives in the aforementioned arbitral and disciplinary proceedings; in order for it to do so, they would need to have been designated area representatives by the trade union. As an illustration, the Government states that in Arbitration No. -, the trade union was not represented at various meetings because, since this requirement ' established in the Memorandum of Understanding ' had not been met, the requested representation leave could not be granted.
.With respect to the allegation of failure to negotiate in good faith with the UCOC, the ACP alleges that it was the UCOC that acted in bad faith at the bargaining table. The ACP reports that, after more than a year of attempting to agree on basic rules for the negotiation of a collective agreement with the UCOC, the trade union brought seven allegations of deadlock before the JRL, upon which",0,2014,Panama
25,"the attempted negotiations were suspended. According to the Government, the JRL ruled in favour of the ACP on six of the seven issues (and, on the remaining issue, merely allowed the trade union to have five negotiators instead of four, as the ACP had proposed). The ACP explains that, once the rulings on the allegations of deadlock had been issued, the Administration sent the UCOC several invitations to resume the negotiations.
.In its communication of  October , the Government makes additional observations and forwards further information supplied by the ACP. In general, the Government considers that the complaint does not fulfil the basic requirements of the precise identification of the facts and the provision of evidence, for which reason it considers that it would be difficult for the Committee to make recommendations on such delicate matters as compensatory guarantees, as it has not been demonstrated or evidence provided that the allegations are well-founded.
.The ACP indicates that it remains in continuous dialogue with workers' organizations, as illustrated by the conclusion of four collective agreements in , including one with the UPCP and one with the UCOC, and that negotiations are being held with machine engineers and firefighters for the conclusion of a new collective agreement with the workers in these bargaining units.
.The ACP reports that it signed a collective agreement with the UPCP on  May . It adds, with reference to the allegations in the complaint concerning this organization, that: (i) during the course of the negotiations, the JRL in ruling No. / of  April  set aside the appeal lodged by the UPCP relating to the deadlock; and (ii) the parties included general clauses on training in the new collective agreement, and six paid training courses have already been agreed upon with the UPCP.
.The ACP adds that it concluded a collective agreement with the UCOC on  July , and notes that the  Memorandum of Understanding (referred to in relation to the issues concerning representation facilities raised by the organization) was included in the trade union representation clauses agreed to in the new collective agreement.
.The ACP also reports that, with reference to the collective agreement that is in force covering Canal pilots, the parties recognize that all work relating to the Cocol and Agua Clara Locks (the expanded Canal) is new and that the parties will revise the standard times for the calculation of working time, which means that the channels of communication will remain open to improve operations and the labour climate. The ACP adds that the last four collective agreements concluded offer benefits, including significant financial elements, for . per cent of Canal workers.
.With regard to the expeditious nature of the procedures for dealing with complaints as compensatory guarantees, the ACP is of the view that consideration could be given to greater supervision of the work of the JRL, which it recalls is the institution that can offer the most appropriate response adapted to the specific labour regulations governing the Canal, as well as continuous training for arbitrators.
.The Committee observes that the complaint concerns allegations of denial of the right to strike, insufficient compensatory guarantees for denial of this right, obstacles to the exercise of privileges by workers' representatives, failure to implement a collective agreement, imposition of unilateral changes in working conditions, failure to bargain in good faith and victimization of trade unionists.
.Concerning the alleged denial of the right to strike, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the fact that the right to strike does not apply in the Panama Canal zone arises from the country s Constitution and is the outcome both of a tripartite national agreement and of the international obligations assumed by the State of Panama, as confirmed by the highest institutions of the State powers. The Committee also notes that, in a direct request published in , the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR), in considering the question of the prohibition of strikes in the Panama Canal zone, expressed the hope that, within the protection of the LOACP, workers who were deprived of an essential means of defending their socio-economic and occupational interests (such as strike action) were, in practice, afforded impartial and rapid compensatory guarantees, for example, conciliation and mediation procedures leading, in the event of deadlock in negotiations, to arbitration machinery seen to be reliable by the parties concerned. The Committee will examine this case from the point of view of the need to ensure that the compensatory guarantees are sufficient, particularly as regards their effectiveness and rapidity, in light of the complainants' allegations and the Government s observations.
.In that regard, the Committee observes that, according to the complainants, the compensatory guarantees for denial of the right to strike are insufficient and, in particular, that the Administration has appealed all decisions and awards that were unfavourable to it before the Supreme Court in order to delay their application for years since, once an appeal has been brought, the authorities do not implement them until the Supreme Court has ruled. The Committee notes that the cases to which the complainants refer involve disputes concerning the implementation of collective agreements. In that connection, it recalls that restriction of the right to strike must be compensated by the right to have recourse to impartial and rapid machinery for individual or collective grievances concerning the interpretation or application of collective agreements. With regard to the specific cases mentioned by the complainants, the Committee takes due note of the Government s explanation that the authorities were obliged to appeal the aforementioned rulings and awards because, in its view, they were unlawful. The Committee observes, however, that these cases show that the proceedings ' from the lodging of a complaint or grievance to its settlement ' can take several years (for example, the complainants indicate that in Complaint No. / on unfair labour practices, over eight years elapsed between the lodging of the complaint and the JRL s ruling and the Supreme Court s decision on appeal is still pending) and that, in the event of an appeal, the ruling or arbitral award is not implemented until it has been confirmed by the Supreme Court. The Committee also notes that the ACP, with regard to the expeditious nature of procedures for dealing with complaints as compensatory guarantees, envisages a better supervision of the work of the JRL and continuous training for arbitrators. The Committee emphasizes that the rapidity of the proceedings and the prompt implementation of the awards or rulings issued are a key element of compensatory mechanisms for denial of the right to strike. It therefore requests the Government, in light of all the statistics on the length of the proceedings established as compensatory guarantees, including the frequency of appeals to the Supreme Court, to facilitate dialogue with the social partners in order to ensure the efficiency and the rapidity of these procedures. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.
.Concerning the alleged refusal to grant representation privileges, the Committee takes note of the complainants' statement that, misinterpreting a Memorandum of Understanding signed with the trade union, the ACP denies that workers' organizations are empowered to decide which of their representatives are entitled to paid representation leave. The Committee also observes that the complainants mention other practices that hinder representation (allegations that representation leave was not granted for meetings organized by trade unions, demands that meetings only be held on the representative s rest days, alteration of the duty roster to allow only a short rest period before meetings, requiring that senior management approve the granting of representation leave, and granting less leave to the workers' team during the mid-term negotiations on a collective agreement). On the one hand, the Committee notes the Government s explanation in its reply that, according to the Memorandum of Understanding, only the three area representatives designated by the trade union are entitled to paid representation leave (a maximum of  hours per week) and that in order for other representatives to be granted such leave, the union would need to designate them area representatives. The Committee also notes the Government s indication that the Memorandum was included in the clauses on trade union representation agreed upon in the new collective agreement. On the other hand, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the other allegations of obstacles to representation and observes that the ACP does not deny that limiting representation leave to the three area representatives can undermine the principles of freedom of association invoked by the complainants (in fact, the ACP recognizes that in one of the aforementioned arbitral proceedings, restricting privileges to area representatives prevented the trade union from attending several meetings). The Committee also observes that, as is clear from the wording of the Memorandum, two weeks' notice of any change in the designated area representatives is required. While recognizing the need to ensure the effective operation of the service, as mentioned by the Government, the Committee would like to point",-1,2014,Panama
26,"out that trade union representatives should enjoy the appropriate privileges for the performance of their duties, including having the time needed to fulfil their representation responsibilities, and that trade unions should be able to decide, without undue restrictions, which representatives can enjoy the representation privileges provided for that purpose. The Committee therefore invites the Government to facilitate dialogue between the competent authorities and the social partners on the existing representation privileges and their implementation in practice in light of the principles of freedom of association.
.With respect to the allegation of failure to negotiate in good faith with the UCOC, the Committee takes note of the disparities between the complainants' account and that of the ACP, each accusing the other of acting in bad faith at the bargaining table. The Committee also notes that the complainant has lodged a complaint on this matter with the JRL and that, on  January , the latter issued a ruling in favour of the Administration on six of the seven issues raised by the trade union. Moreover, the Committee notes the Government s indication that, once the ruling had been issued by the JRL, the ACP made several further invitations to the UCOC to resume negotiations, and that it reports in its recent communication that a collective agreement was concluded with the UCOC on  July . Consequently, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.In relation to the allegations with regard to the UPCP of failure to implement a collective agreement (denial of a request to develop a training programme), unilateral imposition of working conditions and refusal to allow the trade union to engage in collective bargaining, the Committee notes that, according to the information provided by the Government in its latest communication: (i) negotiations continued with the UPCP, and the JRL therefore set aside the appeal lodged by the organization concerning the deadlock; (ii) on  May  a collective agreement was concluded with the UPCP; and (iii) the parties included general clauses on training in the new agreement, and six paid training courses have already been agreed to with the UPCP. As a consequence, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.With regard to the alleged victimization of workers who carry out legitimate trade union activities, the Committee observes that, according to the complainants, when the trade union team was ordered to go back to work during negotiations and refused to do so on the grounds that its members had been granted representation leave, they immediately received written notification that they were subject to a disciplinary measure for failing to obey the order. The Committee also notes that the complainants add that the disciplinary measure was ultimately cancelled and that the complainants do not provide any other specific information or evidence in support of their allegation of victimization and anti-trade-union discrimination. In these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government, in light of all the statistics on the length of the proceedings established as compensatory guarantees, including the frequency of appeals to the Supreme Court, to facilitate dialogue with the social partners in order to ensure the efficiency and rapidity of these procedures for dealing with complaints as compensatory guarantees. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(b) The Committee invites the Government to facilitate dialogue between the competent authorities and the social partners on the existing representation privileges and their implementation in practice in light of the principles of freedom of association.",1,2014,Panama
27,".The Committee last examined this case, which concerns allegations of dismissal of trade unionists, detention of trade unionists and fines for participation in a trade union protest, filing of a criminal complaint for trade union activities, and break-in at the headquarters of the Firefighters' Association of the Republic of Panama, at its meeting in October  (see Report No. , paras ' ). On that occasion, the Committee welcomed the referral of the case to the Committee for the rapid handling of complaints relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining and suggested to the authorities that, as far as possible, recourse be had to dialogue mechanisms rather than penal action. The Committee also requested the complainant organization and the Government to keep it informed of any ruling handed down with regard to the alleged break-in at the headquarters of the Firefighters' Association and the deprivation of the use thereof to the detriment of the Association, and invited the Government to take steps, pending the judicial ruling, to provide the Association with premises to facilitate the exercise of its activities.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government indicates that on  May , the Committee for the rapid handling of complaints relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining signed an agreement to close Case No.  before the Committee on Freedom of Association on the grounds that it had been settled to the satisfaction of those concerned and in accordance with the terms provided for in national legislation, ILO Conventions and the observations of the ILO supervisory bodies. The Government annexed a copy of the above-mentioned Agreement, which indicates that, in view of the reinstatement and payment of back pay of Mr Cruz Gomez and Mr Ral Marshall (who, as indicated in the complaint, had been the most belligerent in the trade union protest) of the Fire Brigade of the Republic of Panama, the case was closed, and the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development was requested to inform the Committee on Freedom of Association of the above.
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government and welcomes the fact that the reinstatement of the above-mentioned workers and the agreement concerning the case were reached within the Committee for the rapid handling of complaints relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining, which demonstrates the fundamental role played by the said Committee. On the basis of the above and having received no further information in this respect, the Committee considers that the case is closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  November  from the Confederation of Workers of the Republic of Panama (CTRP).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May  and  January .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the CTRP alleges that in December  and January and February  the permanent staff of the Fire Service of the Republic of Panama, who are members of the Firefighters' Association of the Republic of Panama, held a number of protests to demand better conditions of work and wage increases which had been established by law but not implemented by the administration. The protests culminated in agreements signed by the parties concerning observance of the law with regard to wages and the promise by the administration to seek to improve conditions of work for the protestors.
.The complainant organization indicates that, as part of the protests, over a dozen firefighters announced a hunger strike and took up positions outside a number of fire stations. The administration dismissed all of them. As a result of the pressure of the protest and further to mediation by the Catholic Church, nearly all the firefighters were reinstated, the exceptions being two union members, Mr Cruz Gmez and Mr Ral Marshall, who were not reinstated on account of being the most belligerent participants in the protest.
.The CTRP adds that in February , as a result of the protests, the director-general of the Fire Service of the Republic of Panama filed a criminal complaint against the protesters, claiming improper use of institutional property, which was dismissed by the judicial authorities.
.Furthermore, according to the allegations, in February  the peaceful protest held by the firefighters outside certain stations was dispersed by the national police, which arrested  of them and brought them before the administrative police authorities (Corregidor de California), which ultimately fined them for causing public disorder. The fines had to be paid in order to secure their release.
.The CTRP also adds that the headquarters of the Firefighters' Association was broken into by the administration of the fire service, without any justification and in the absence of its leaders, the doors being forced. As a result of this offence, it was necessary to file a complaint with the competent authorities.
.The CTRP emphasizes that no regulations have been adopted in the Republic of Panama indicating that firefighters are excluded from exercising freedom of association or engaging in protests. On the contrary, section  of the Administrative Careers Act (No.  of ) includes the fire service among the institutions which are obliged to provide a minimum service during a strike, which implies that the right to strike and hence to freedom of association is recognized for these public servants under the law.
.The CTRP requests the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association to call on the Government to put an end to the harassment of trade union officials in the public sector and to respect the freedom of association of permanent fire service staff, who are members of the Firefighters' Association of the Republic of Panama, by dropping the measures taken in reprisal against their leaders.
.In its communications dated  May  and  January , the Government states that when the protests by the Firefighters' Association of the Republic of Panama began in December , the Fire Service of the Republic of Panama was not paying the wage increases prescribed in Act No.  of  March  since they did not have the budget resources to do so. The Government states that at the end of October  the firefighters announced the submission of a list of  points, which received a reply on  November , with various acts of protest and demonstration being carried out both previously and subsequently. The Government adds that the protests culminated in the signature of agreements by the parties designed to ensure compliance with the legislation relating to wages and improvements in conditions of work, uniforms, firefighting equipment, vehicles and training, which took effect in  and , as well as improvements regarding promotion, changes of category for candidates, wage standardization ' which took effect according to rank '  bonuses and discounts for operators. The Government also states that seven of the nine individuals dismissed in the wake of the protests of  January  were reinstated in their posts after a review by the fire service at the request of the persons concerned, and two trade unionists (Mr Cruz Enrique Gmez and Mr Ral Marshall) were reinstated later, without any interruption to their period of service.
.The Government states, in relation to these dismissals, that a number of firefighters announced as part of the trade union protests and demonstrations that they were on hunger strike, taking up positions outside a number of fire stations, and that the demonstrators used firefighting vehicles in an unauthorized manner, grouping all the vehicles together at one depot, using sirens for lengthy periods, holding placards with degrading messages and shouting slogans against the authorities of the institution. During the second wave of protests, there were marches, stoppages, strikes, calls for anarchy and contempt of the authorities, which culminated in the protest of  March . This was not a peaceful protest: masked individuals carrying blunt objects made use of service vehicles and blocked the public highway, as a result of which the police were obliged to intervene to restore public tranquillity.
.The Government adds that the complainant s statement that the criminal complaint filed by the director-general of the fire service against the protestors for unauthorized use of the vehicles of the institution was dismissed by the authorities is only partially accurate, since the competent authorities conducted inquiries of their own in the wake of the complaint and in some cases the prosecutor s office requested a temporary stay of proceedings, so the complaint cannot be considered to have been dismissed by the authorities. On the contrary, the complaint continues to be under investigation, having given rise to the temporary detention of  demonstrators and fines for public disorder.
.As regards the allegation that the Firefighters' Association headquarters was broken into by the fire service administration, with no justification, in the absence of its leaders and with entry having been forced, as a result of which it was necessary to file",0,2013,Panama
28,"the criminal complaint, the Government disputes the accuracy of this statement, since the premises were transferred to the National Directorate for Firefighting, Search and Rescue Operations at the request of its director on grounds of insufficient physical space, and this arrangement was duly communicated to the Firefighters' Association, even though its leaders failed to comply with it. The Government adds that the fire service administration knew that the Association had filed a complaint when staff from the Public Prosecution Service came to conduct an on-the-spot inspection; nevertheless, to date no charges have been brought against the fire service administration.
.In conclusion, the Government points out that it is committed to respecting, promoting and fully applying Conventions Nos  and  and is striving to strengthen tripartite dialogue mechanisms. Accordingly, it has submitted the present case to the Committee for the rapid handling of complaints relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining with a view to reaching agreement by consensus.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges that in the present case anti-union reprisals occurred in the context of a dispute that started in  owing to non-payment of wage increases established by law (a point acknowledged by the Government) and a number of trade union demands relating to conditions of work. The Committee observes that both the complainant and the Government concur that the parties reached agreements which settled the demands from which the dispute had arisen and that the trade unionists who had been dismissed were reinstated in their posts. The Government points out that the dismissals and the temporary detention of  demonstrators with the imposition of fines were due to excesses committed by the demonstrators, including the use and accumulation of official vehicles at one station, calls to anarchy, blocking of the public highway, the carrying of blunt objects by masked individuals and various instances of public disorder.
.The Committee notes the complainant s statement that the judicial authorities dismissed the criminal complaint filed by the director-general of the fire service for unauthorized use of official vehicles, while the Government maintains that the complaint is still under investigation and that in some cases the prosecution service requested a temporary stay of proceedings. In view of the fact that the vast majority of the points of dispute were settled through agreements between the parties and taking account of the situation involving a requested temporary stay of proceedings by the prosecution service, the Committee, while acknowledging that there should be no unauthorized use of official vehicles in the context of the exercise of freedom of association, welcomes the submission of the case to the Committee for the rapid handling of complaints relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining (which the Committee recalls is a mechanism that was the result of ILO technical assistance and a tripartite agreement) and suggests, with a view to the full restoration of harmony in labour relations, that, to the extent possible, recourse is had to dialogue, rather than penal action.
.As regards the alleged break-in at the headquarters of the Firefighters' Association of the Republic of Panama, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the transfer of the premises to the National Directorate for Firefighting, Search and Rescue Operations as decided by its director was due to the fact that the directorate had insufficient physical space and that the Association was duly notified of this decision. The Committee observes that, according to the Government s reply, the Association filed a complaint with the prosecution service in relation to the break-in at its headquarters.
.The Committee requests the complainant organization and the Government to inform it of any ruling handed down in this respect and, in view of the damage caused to the Firefighters' Association as a result of the administrative decision which deprived it of its headquarters, invites the Government to take steps, pending the judicial ruling, to provide the Association with premises to facilitate the exercise of its activities.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee welcomes the submission of the case to the Committee for the rapid handling of complaints relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and suggests, with a view to the full restoration of harmony in labour relations, that, to the extent possible, recourse is had to dialogue rather than penal action.(b)	The Committee requests the complainant organization and the Government to inform it of any ruling handed down with regard to the alleged break-in at the headquarters of the Firefighters' Association and the deprivation of the use thereof to the detriment of the Association, and invites the Government to take steps, pending the judicial ruling, to provide the Association with premises to facilitate the exercise of its activities.",-1,2013,Panama
29,".The complaint in the present case is contained in a communication from the National Federation of Associations and Organizations of Public Employees (FENASEP) dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  June and  October .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  November , FENASEP alleges that the Deputy General Secretary of FENASEP, Mr Edgardo Voitier, was transferred from one province (Coln) to another (Panam) without being consulted and was subsequently dismissed by the National Customs Authority pursuant to Administrative Decision No.  of  November , without any disciplinary reason or grounds for dismissal being given.
.The complainant organization explains that Mr Edgardo Voitier had been appointed as a clerk but worked as a customs inspector, and that the decision in question disregarded the protection that he was afforded in his capacity as Deputy General Secretary and for having been expressly appointed by FENASEP as one of the three officers who enjoy the privilege granted under section  of the Consolidated Text of Act No.  of  June , as amended. According to the provision in question:  The following public servants, even if they do not occupy a public administration career position, can be dismissed only for the reasons established in the present act: () the General Secretary of any association or federation of public servants, from the time of his or her selection until three months after the conclusion of the term of office for which he or she was elected; and () up to three key officers of the executive boards or executive committees of associations or federations of public servants, appointed by the corresponding association or federation of public servants, for the duration of their appointment by their organization. The names of these officers will be provided to the General Directorate of the Public Administration  ?Having been notified on  November  of the contents of Decision No.  of  November , Mr Edgardo Voitier filed an application for reconsideration with the General Directorate of Customs on  November of the same year.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government states that, in dismissing Mr Edgardo Voitier on  November , the appointing authority was exercising its discretionary power, since his appointment is based on the trust that his superiors have in him; and that the administrative procedure in question was carried out in compliance with all procedural safeguards. The Government also states that, in Administrative Decision No.  of  December , a response was given to the application for reconsideration filed by Mr Edgardo Voitier, upholding the contested decision. Once the content of that decision had been notified, administrative channels were exhausted.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government reported that the National Customs Authority had rehired Mr Edgardo Voitier as a project coordinator. The Government considered it important to highlight that the working conditions of the official in the position to which he was transferred are, in terms of remuneration, better than those he had prior to his dismissal. The Government also stated that an application for review filed by Mr Edgardo Voitier with the Supreme Court of Justice was pending a decision. It added that, as soon as the court s decision on the transfer is known, it will be accepted by the National Customs Authority.
.Furthermore, the Government reports that this matter has also been referred to the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints relating to Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, which arose from the Panama Tripartite Agreement signed on  February  and was officially established by Executive Decree No.  of  September .
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization in this case alleges the violation of the protection afforded to certain trade union officials (trade union immunity) under the Consolidated Text of Act No.  of  June , as amended, and more specifically relates to the transfer and subsequent dismissal of trade union official Mr Edgardo Voitier. The Committee notes the Government s statements that: () in dismissing Mr Edgardo Voitier, the appointing authority was exercising its discretionary power and the administrative procedure in question was carried out in compliance with all procedural safeguards; () subsequently Mr Edgardo Voitier was rehired by the National Customs Authority as a project coordinator, with better conditions in terms of remuneration than those he had previously; () an application for review filed by Mr Edgardo Voitier with the Supreme Court of Justice, regarding his transfer, is pending a decision; and () the case of this official has been referred to the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints relating to Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining. The Committee regrets the action of dismissal initially taken against this trade union official given that the Consolidated Text of Act No.  of  June , as amended, affords protection to active trade union officials against dismissal and that the Government has provided no information on the specific events that led to the dismissal, and has merely referred to the administration s discretionary power to dismiss him. Taking into account that the subsequent rehiring of this official upheld the initial, previously decided transfer to another post, the Committee requests the Government to communicate the outcome of the application filed with the Supreme Court of Justice against his transfer and any agreement reached within the framework of the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints relating to Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to communicate the outcome of the application filed with the Supreme Court of Justice against the transfer of Mr Edgardo Voitier to another post, and any agreement reached within the framework of the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints relating to Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining.",0,2014,Panama
30,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Workers of the Republic of Panama (CTRP) of September .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  March .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication of September , the CTRP alleges that the Minister of Labour and Employment Development rejected the registration of the Trade Union of Public and Private Transport Workers of Panama (SITTRACOSEP) and, on the day after that rejection, more than  workers of the enterprise Transporte Masivo de Panam SA  Mi Bus'  who supported the creation of the union, were dismissed.
.The complainant also alleges that an enterprise trade union already exists, controlled by the enterprise. The complainant attaches the text of the Minister s ruling, dated  January , in which she rejected the application for the registration of SITTRACOSEP. The complainant alleges that these acts violate ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.In a communication dated  March , the Government declares that the refusal to grant SITTRACOSEP legal personality was not the result of a pre-established labour policy, but due to inconsistencies in the documentation provided in the application for legal personality, which are inadmissible in such an important act.
.The Government explains that on  January , the Department of Social Organizations of the General Directorate of Labour received an application for legal personality from the organization.
.Having examined the documentation, the Department observed that the membership of the trade union that was being established included workers of the enterprise Transporte Masivo de Panam SA, and certain self-employed workers, which made it impossible to continue processing the application, since the law prohibits the existence of two enterprise unions in the same enterprise, as set out in section  of the Labour Code. Nor could it be considered an industry union as the workers wishing to create the occupational organization do not work in two or more enterprises. Once the Department of Social Organizations realized that most of the founding members of the organization worked for that enterprise, and that the rest were independent transport operators, it observed that, although the stated purpose of the application was to register an industry union, section () of the Labour Code provides that  Trade unions are: ' . Industry unions, when they are established by persons with different occupations, functions or specialities, providing services in two or more enterprises of the same type' 
.The union merely indicated that its members work for the same enterprise and that the rest are self-employed.
.However, if it is understood that the application for legal personality is for an enterprise trade union, the provisional executive committee of the applicant union is exclusively made up of workers of the enterprise Transporte Masivo de Panam SA, which already has a trade union. It is also impossible to determine which workers are engaged in private transport and/or are self-employed. Accordingly, after the examination of the documentation, it was concluded that the aim of this new industry trade union was to carry out the functions of an enterprise union.
.If it is considered to be an enterprise union, the Government reiterates that the Ministry cannot allow two trade unions of the same nature to coexist in the same enterprise, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code:Note No. DM..Section . n enterprise shall not have more than one enterprise trade union. Trade unions that find themselves in such a situation upon the entry into force of this Code will have one year in which to merge. If such a merger has not occurred by the end of that period, the Government shall proceed to the dissolution for that reason of the trade union with the lowest number of members.
.Following its examination of the application, the intention could not be understood as the establishment of an industry trade union, as it was not possible to identify the two enterprises in which the workers were engaged, nor an enterprise union, while another enterprise union existed. On these grounds, the Ministry of Labour and Employment Development cannot proceed with registration as the application does not comply with the requirements of section  of the Labour Code for the determination of the type of union that is to be established.
.The Government indicates that the provisions of the Labour Code respecting the establishment of trade unions, and in particular the prohibition in section  of more than one enterprise trade union in the same enterprise, has been the subject of  observations' from the ILO supervisory bodies which supervise the application of Convention No. , among others, including the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR), the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards and the Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA).
.Accordingly, the Committee on the Panama Tripartite Agreement, also known as the  Harmonization Committee' (created in the context of the social dialogue established under the Panama Tripartite Agreement, signed on  February ), has included this subject in the list of observations by the ILO supervisory bodies which will be examined, studied and consensus-based solutions agreed upon through social dialogue within the Committee, to align national labour legislation with the provisions of Convention No. . It should be emphasized that the Committee on the Panama Tripartite Agreement is the social dialogue committee which is responsible for developing draft legislation and finding compromises based on consensus to align national law with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and , in accordance with the comments of the supervisory bodies on the application of ILO Conventions. If consensus is achieved between the parties, its mandate may be extended to the harmonization of other ILO Conventions ratified by Panama for which there are problems of implementation in national law.
.The Government indicates that, being aware of the importance of social dialogue as an instrument to find ways of resolving problems in the implementation of ILO Conventions Nos  and , it considered it appropriate to refer this case to the Tripartite Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints relating to Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining (also known as the  Complaints Committee'  on  February  so that it could be examined through tripartite dialogue in order to identify solutions and reach agreements based on consensus.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges the rejection of the registration of the legal personality of SITTRACOSEP on  January , and the dismissal of more than  workers of the enterprise Mi Bus on the day after this administrative decision. The complainant also alleges that an enterprise trade union already exists, controlled by the enterprise. The Committee notes the Government s indication that the substantive legal grounds for refusing the registration of the applicant union related to the fact that it did not represent workers from two or more enterprises (an industry union) and/or that an enterprise union already existed, for which reason another could not be registered under sections  and  of the Labour Code.
.The Committee notes that the Government recalls that this case involves provisions of the Labour Code relating to the establishment of trade unions to which objections have been raised by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Committee on Freedom of Association, and that these issues will be discussed in the (Tripartite) Harmonization Committee in order to find solutions based on consensus. The Committee notes that the Government, which expresses the wish to align its legislation with ILO Conventions Nos  and , has also submitted this case to the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints Relating to Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining with a view to its examination through tripartite dialogue in order to identify solutions and reach agreements based on consensus.
.The Committee recalls that all workers, without distinction whatsoever, including without discrimination in regard to occupation, should have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing, and that the free exercise of the right to establish and join unions implies the free determination of the structure and composition of unions [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee firmly expects the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints to reach solutions which will satisfy the applicant trade union, SITTRACOSEP, and which will resolve the legislative problems related to the establishment of trade union organizations mentioned by the Government in its reply, and which make it impossible to legally establish an enterprise trade union when another already exists, and to establish an industry union which represents both the workers of an enterprise and self-employed workers.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent any observations regarding the allegations concerning the dismissal of more than  workers on the day following the refusal to register the applicant trade",0,2013,Panama
31,"union, or the allegation that an enterprise union already exists, which is controlled by the enterprise. The Committee urges the Government to conduct an inquiry without delay and to obtain information about the enterprise through the relevant employers' organization, and that if the allegations are proven, to take measures to resolve the situation and to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee recalls that all workers, without distinction whatsoever, including without discrimination in regard to occupation, should have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing, and that the free exercise of the right to establish and join unions implies the free determination of the structure and composition of unions. The Committee firmly expects the Complaints Committee to reach solutions which will satisfy the applicant trade union, SITTRACOSEP, and which will resolve the legislative problems related to the creation of trade union organizations mentioned by the Government in its reply, which make it impossible to legally establish an enterprise union when another already exists, and to establish an industry union which represents both the workers of an enterprise and self-employed workers.(b) The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent any observations regarding the allegation concerning the dismissal of more than  workers on the day following the refusal of the registration of the applicant trade union, or in answer to the allegation that an enterprise union already exists that is controlled by the enterprise.

32,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting. On that occasion the Committee trusted that the necessary steps would be taken to draw up specific draft provisions to bring the Public Administration Careers Act into full conformity with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining laid down in the relevant Conventions so as to guarantee public servants who do not work in the administration of the State adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and interference, as well as the right to collective bargaining, and to ensure that the complainant (the National Union of Education Workers ' SINTE) may obtain legal personality and be registered as a trade union [see st Report, paras ' ].
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that, in its communications of  and  May , the Government informs that, pursuant to Resolution No.  of  April , the complainant was registered and granted legal personality. The Committee also notes with interest that the Government further informs about the preparation of a draft bill on collective relations in the public sector to address the observations of the ILO supervisory bodies in relation to the application of Conventions Nos  and , and observes that these legislative matters are being followed up by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Union of Education Workers (SINTE) dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the National Union of Education Workers (SINTE) states that it is a teachers' union in the process of becoming established, with nationwide coverage in public and private schools. SINTE alleges that, on  June , it submitted an application for legal personality ' along with all the documentation required under the labour law ' to the Labour Ministry s Department of Social Organizations of the Directorate-General of Labour and Workforce Development, and that the application was declared unfounded by the department in question on  July . SINTE adds that, on  September , the Directorate-General of Labour and Workforce Development issued decision No.  DGT dismissing the appeal lodged against the decision of the Department of Social Organizations on the grounds of inadmissibility.
.The complainant indicates that the administrative authority rejected its application on the grounds that the provisions set out in the Labour Code do not apply to the public sector. In this regard, SINTE points out that its members include not only public servants but also teachers in the private sector, and that all members work in the same branch ' education. Lastly, the complainant asserts that its intention is not to establish an association under ordinary law pursuant to the general right of association enshrined in article  of the Constitution, but to exercise its right to organize under article  of the Constitution and international conventions.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that it is in compliance with the ratified conventions, including those concerning freedom of association. Furthermore, it recalls that it maintains a policy of tripartite dialogue and that, with the ILO s support, it is promoting the implementation of Conventions Nos  and  via the committees set up within the framework of the Panama Tripartite Agreement, which was signed by the social partners on  February .
.The Government adds that, in the instant case, the Department of Social Organizations of the Directorate-General of Labour rejected SINTE s application for trade union status via Note No.  DOS. of  June  when it became aware of the fact that the founding members of the union were public servants and hence not governed by the Labour Code. In the aforementioned note, it cited the  June  decision of the First High Labour Court, which was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court of Justice, ruling that the provisions established in the Labour Code did not apply to workers in the public sector. The Government states that the Constitution differentiates between the right of association and the right to organize, both of which are governed by the Constitution, and that that does not restrict public sector workers' right of association, since they are able to form an organization by registering with the Government Ministry. The Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development is unable to take action and grant legal personality to a group of public sector workers, as doing so would contravene the law.
.Finally, the Government declares that, under the provisions of the Panama Tripartite Agreement, it is for the committee responsible for the compliance of national legislation with ILO Conventions, in particular the Subcommittee on Administrative Careers, to decide on amendments to the law by common agreement.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant alleges that the labour administration authority rejected its application for legal personality in  on the grounds that the provisions of the Labour Code did not apply to the public sector. (SINTE states that its membership includes teachers in the private sector as well as public servants, and that they all work in the same branch ' education.)
.In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government reports that: () the Department of Social Organizations of the Directorate-General of Labour rejected SINTE s application for trade union status via Note No.  DOS. of  June  when it noted that the founding members of the union were public servants and that they were not governed by the Labour Code; () in that note, it cited the  June  decision of the First High Labour Court, subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court of Justice, which ruled that the provisions established in the Labour Code did not apply to workers in the public sector; () the Constitution differentiates between the right of association and the right to organize, both of which are governed by the Constitution, and that that does not restrict public sector workers' right of association, since they are able to form an organization by registering with the Government Ministry; () the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development is unable to take action and grant legal personality to a group of public sector workers, as doing so would contravene the law, and () under the provisions of the Panama Tripartite Agreement, it is for the committee responsible for the compliance of national legislation with ILO Conventions, in particular the Subcommittee on Administrative Careers, to decide on amendments to the law by common agreement.
.The Committee takes note of this information and recalls that in the past it has had occasion to examine allegations of an administrative authority having declined to grant legal personality to a union of public servants whose employment relationship is governed not by the Labour Code but by the Public Administration Careers Act [see Case No. , Reports , ,  and ]. The Committee recalls that on that occasion () it considered that  there are no grounds for challenging the validity of special legal regulations which govern public servants' right to organize in so far as such regulations comply with the provisions of Convention No. '  and () requested the Government to take steps to ensure that national legislation guarantees the public servants who do not work in the administration of the State (which is the case for teachers in the public sector) adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and interference, as well as the right to collective bargaining.
.The Committee reiterates the recommendations made at that time, and trusts that the committee responsible for the compliance of national legislation with ILO Conventions, in particular the Subcommittee on Administrative Careers, will take the necessary steps to draw up, as a matter of urgency, specific draft provisions to bring the Public Administration Careers Act into conformity with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining laid down in the relevant Conventions and to guarantee the rights and guarantees mentioned in the previous paragraph so as to ensure that the complainant may obtain legal personality and be registered as a trade union in the near future.

.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January , SITRASEJUP states that it is a nationwide trainee lawyers' association and that it submitted an application for legal personality to the Department of Social Organizations of the General Labour Department of the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development on  October . SITRASEJUP alleges that the application was rejected and that this is stated in resolution DM- of  December .
.The complainant states that the administrative authority is preventing the professionals it represents from enjoying the right to organize and is in breach of article  of the national Constitution, which grants employers, employees and professionals of all categories the right to organize, and article () of the Labour Code, which provides for the existence of trade unions of persons from the same profession, trade or specialist skill area.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development decided, by resolution DM- of  December , to reject SITRASEJUP s application for legal personality as it failed to satisfy the criteria laid down in the Labour Code. The Government states that the documentation submitted by the complainant organization failed to meet the minimum requirements set forth in article  of the Labour Code. Furthermore, the Government notes that the trade union statute provides for eight secretariats whereas the founding instrument names only seven directors, and that the women s secretariat is mentioned in the founding instrument but not in the statute. The Government states that it issued the aforementioned resolution after examining the application and taking into account the shortcomings and inconsistencies.
.The Government notes that after the trade union received notification of the resolution, its authorized representative submitted a request for review; however, the appellant failed to substantiate said request within the statutory time period and it was declared null and void.
.Lastly, the Government informs the Committee that the case was due to be examined by the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints concerning Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining established under the  Panama Tripartite Agreement, but that the work of said committee has been suspended since November  because the workers' sector withdrew from the committee.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that on  October , the Department of Social Organizations of the General Labour Department of the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development rejected its application for legal personality by resolution DM- dated  December  and that it thereby prevented the professionals it represents from enjoying the right to organize.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government reports that: () the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development decided, by resolution DM- of  December, to reject SITRASEJUP s application for legal personality as it failed to satisfy the criteria and minimum requirements laid down in the Labour Code, in particular article ; () the trade union statute provides for eight secretariats, whereas the founding instrument names only seven directors, and that the women s secretariat is mentioned in the founding instrument but not in the statute; () after the trade union received notification of the resolution, its authorized representative submitted a request for review; however, the appellant failed to substantiate the said request within the statutory time period and it was declared null and void; and () the case was due to be examined by the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints concerning Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining established under the  Panama Tripartite Agreement, but the work of the said committee has been suspended since November  because the workers' sector had withdrawn from the committee.
.The Committee takes note of this information and in particular the Government s submission that the complainant organization failed to substantiate the request for review which it lodged against the administrative resolution rejecting its application for legal personality. Furthermore, as regards the examination of the case by the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints concerning Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining and that committee s operational problems, the Committee notes with interest that, during the June  session of the International Labour Conference, the Standards Department encouraged the Panama tripartite delegation to meet and that during that meeting an agreement was signed whereby the Government and the social partners undertook to make every effort to revive the roundtables with a view to officially resuming their work as soon as possible. Consequently, taking account of the fact that freedom of association is a fundamental right, the Committee is confident that the case in question may be examined promptly within the framework of the aforementioned committee, that the shortcomings identified by the Government will be remedied and that SITRASEJUP will ultimately be granted the legal personality it seeks.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee is confident that the case in question may be examined promptly by the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints concerning Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, and that SITRASEJUP will ultimately be granted the legal personality it seeks.",0,2012,Panama

.In their communication of  January , the ANFACSS, AECSS, AMOACSS and the CONUSI allege that since the new administration of the Social Insurance Fund came into office there has been a policy of human rights and freedom of association violations that has been prejudicial to the administrative and health-sector unions. This has allegedly resulted in trade union officials being vilified in the media, bans on exercising the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, bans on trade union leave, workers being encouraged to resign their trade union membership, transfers of trade union officials without consultation and, lastly, the dismissal of two trade union officials, Mr Juan Samaniego and Ms Elineth Menchaca. Finally, the complainant organizations state that the alleged violations of trade union rights prompted a large number of unions to establish the National Coordinating Body of United Unions of the Social Insurance Fund, through which proceedings have been initiated before the General Directorate.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that as a result of an ILO technical assistance mission that visited Panama in January  the Tripartite Agreement for Panama was signed, establishing a committee for the implementation of the agreement and a committee for the rapid handling of complaints regarding freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Government indicates that the present case was examined under the auspices of the latter committee, and with the input of a moderator appointed by the ILO. An agreement was signed, which contained a proposal for the Social Insurance Fund to take steps to resolve five of the allegations presented in the complaint and it was agreed that the joint meetings would continue in order to resolve all the issues raised in the case before the Committee.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that on  December , the Social Insurance Fund signed an agreement on trade union freedoms with the complainant organizations, which was endorsed by the Catholic Church and the Office of the Ombudsperson, in which the Fund undertook to guarantee and promote the principle of trade union freedom, as well as freedom of association and other fundamental rights and guarantees enshrined in the Political Constitution. In addition, the Government indicates that it was also established that: () the Social Insurance Fund repeals and renders void the memorandum of  June , encouraging workers to resign their trade union membership; () all officials will respect the right to affiliate and resign from affiliation with any trade union, free from interference of any sort; () the Social Insurance Fund declares its firm respect of the right to freedom of expression and freedom of information, both recognized under the Political Constitution, subject to the limitations established by law, and, consequently, respects and guarantees the right of trade unions to exercise them freely; and () modalities were established to facilitate the exercise of the right of assembly and the granting of trade union leave through the distribution of publications, the submission of lists of claims and the granting of trade union leave to trade union officials to enable them to initiate or participate in organizational and training activities.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege a number of violations of trade union rights (bans on exercising freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, bans on trade union leave, workers being encouraged to resign their trade union membership, transfers and the dismissal of two trade union officials) at the Social Insurance Fund.
.The Committee recalls that in June  it noted that  at the request of the Government and in the framework of the Special Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints concerning Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, a technical assistance/mediation mission was conducted in relation to the issues raised in the complaint alleging violations of trade union rights at the Social Insurance Fund and that in the context of the mission the parties signed an agreement which contains concrete commitments, including joint meetings. In this respect, the Committee expects that all issues raised in the complaint will be dealt with in accordance with the abovementioned agreement and requests the Government and the complainant organizations to keep it informed of developments relating to the implementation of this agreement' [see th Report, para. ].
.The Committee notes that in a recent communication the Government states that on  December , the Social Insurance Fund signed an agreement on trade union freedoms with the complainant organizations, which was endorsed by the Catholic Church and the Office of the Ombudsperson, in which the Fund undertook to guarantee and promote the principle of trade union freedom as well as freedom of association and other fundamental rights and guarantees enshrined in the Political Constitution. In addition, the Government indicates that it was also established that: () the Social Insurance Fund repeals and renders void the memorandum of  June  encouraging workers to resign their trade union membership; () all officials will respect the right to affiliate and resign from affiliation with any trade union free from interference of any sort; () the Social Insurance Fund declares its firm respect of the right to freedom of expression and freedom of information, both recognized under the Political Constitution subject to the limitations established by law, and consequently respects and guarantees the right of trade unions to exercise them freely; and () modalities were established to facilitate the exercise of the right of assembly and the granting of trade union leave through the distribution of publications, the submission of lists of claims and the granting of trade union leave to trade union officials to enable them to initiate or participate in organizational and training activities.
.The Committee notes this information with interest and expects that the agreement signed by the parties has taken into account the allegations relating to the dismissal of two trade union leaders. Under these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue the examination of the allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to consider that this case does not call for further examination.",0,2012,Panama
36,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see rd Report, paras ' ] when it made the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee takes note with deep concern a number of the reasons given by the Government for refusing to register or grant legal personality to the six trade union organizations in formation mentioned in the complaint. The Committee considers that the different legal requirements or their interpretation in practice in this case appear to have contravened Article  of Convention No.  under which workers without distinction whatsoever and without previous authorization have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing.(b)	The Committee, on the one hand, urges the Government to adopt measures to amend legislation to bring it in line with Convention No.  and, as it has already done with regard to Case No. , the Committee requests the Government, including the administrative authorities, to examine with the complainants in a proactive and constructive manner the reasons for this situation so as to assess how the system is working in practice and how to resolve the issue of registration or access to legal personality for trade union organizations whose registration has been denied. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(c)	The Committee also understands that some of the cases of denial of legal personality have been submitted to the judicial authority and requests the Government to inform it of the decisions handed down.(d)	Lastly, with regard to the allegations that the workers who signed the intention to form the SINTEGPPI and those who signed the intention to form a workers' trade union in  Panama Gaming and Services of Panam' and/or  Cirsa Panam SA' were dismissed, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent detailed comments on these serious allegations and, recalling that pursuant to Article  of Convention No.  it is expressly prohibited to  cause the dismissal of, or otherwise prejudice, a worker by reason of union membership'  the Committee urges the Government, should the allegations be verified, to take steps to reinstate the workers of both trade unions immediately and compensate them for their losses (salaries and benefits) and to keep it informed thereof.
.In a communication of  January , the Government reports that:' As regards recommendation (a), the issue of the refusal to grant legal personality to the trade union organizations in formation mentioned in the complaint, is included in the list of matters that will be addressed by the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints, established under the Panama Tripartite Agreement, and will be evaluated through tripartite dialogue under the moderation of Dr Rolando Murgas. The Committee notes this information and trusts that this matter will be resolved in the near future.' As regards recommendation (b), concerning the need to amend the legislation (on the registration of legal personality) to bring it in line with Convention No. , the committee responsible for analysing areas for harmonization in national legislation, established under the Panama Tripartite Agreement, is drawing up a list of matters to be addressed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and information will be sent when the necessary consensus is achieved. The Committee takes note of this information and trusts that the necessary amendments to the legislation will be adopted in the near future.' As regards, recommendation (c), only one denial of legal personality (the case of the Industrial Trade Union of Panamanian Waterway Workers and Related Industries) was brought before the courts. The Supreme Court of Justice ordered the approval of a new list of trade union members, but it did not grant the trade union legal personality. Furthermore, the Government reports that this case will be examined by the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints. The Committee notes this information and firmly expects that, once the legal requirements have been met, legal personality will be granted to the trade union organization in question.' As regards recommendation (d), the workers of the company  Panama Gaming & Services of Panam' and/or  Cirsa Panam SA'  referred to by the complainant organizations, were not dismissed but rather signed a mutual agreement with the company to terminate their employment relationship. As regards the company  Gaming Properties of Panam Inc.'  the founding members of the trade union organization left the company, and legal personality was denied on the grounds that the trade union lacked the minimum number of workers () needed to establish a company trade union. The Committee takes note of this information. In accordance with the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its  observation on the application of Convention No.  by Panama, the Committee considers that the minimum number of  workers required to form a trade union under the Labour Code should be reduced so as not to obstruct the creation of company trade unions. The Committee trusts that this matter will be addressed within the framework of the Committee in charge of analysing areas for harmonization in national legislation established under the Panama Tripartite Agreement, and that the necessary steps will be taken to amend the relevant legislative provisions.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  from the Autonomous Trade Union Confederation of Panamanian Workers (CGTP).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the CGTP alleges that the authorities refused to register or grant legal personality to the following trade union organizations in formation: () the Agricultural Workers' Union of Corregimiento de Tort; () the  Gaming Properties of Panama Inc.' Workers' Trade Union (SINETEGPPI); () a workers' trade union in  Panama Gaming and Services of Panam SA' and/or  Cirsa Panam SA'  () the Dockworkers, Checkers and Operators of Balboa and Cristbal Ports Workers' Trade Union (SITEVOP-BALCRIS); () the Health Committee Workers' Trade Union; and () the Industrial Trade Union of Panamanian Waterway Workers and Related Industries. According to the allegations, the workers who signed the intention to form the  Gaming Properties of Panama Inc.' Workers' Union and those who signed the intention to form a workers' union in  Panama Gaming and Services of Panam SA' and/or  Cirsa Panam SA' were dismissed.
.The complainant organization sent a copy of the administrative rulings and decisions adopted based on the appeals lodged and emphasizes that the decisions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Development have violated the provisions of the Labour Code (whose section , for example, stipulates that objections to the application for registration of a trade union may only be made if the intended purpose is not laid down in legislation, if it was not formed with the minimum legal number of members or if the legally-required documentation is not submitted in the correct form) and of ILO Convention No. .
.The complainant organization also alleges that the Ministry of Labour rejected the list of dispute grievances submitted for the purposes of collective bargaining by the Hotel, Gastronomy and Tourism Workers' Trade Union against: () Comidas y Bebidas Especializadas Int. SA; and ()  Cirsa Panam SA' and/or  Gaming and Services'  even though in both cases the companies' workers were present at the conciliation hearings convened by the Ministry.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that the complaint of the CGTP is completely unfounded. The Government recognizes and values the principle of freedom of association as a fundamental right of labour relations and the important role that it plays in democratic consolidation, governance and social peace. In this regard, its provisions are incorporated in national legislation and practice, through which it complies with its stipulations to ensure that freedom of association and collective bargaining are developed effectively throughout the country.
.With regard to the denial of legal personality to the Agricultural Workers' Union of Corregimiento de Tort, the Government states that, in fact, on  November , the application for registration of legal personality was filed with the General Labour Directorate of the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Employment and Labour Development (MITRADEL), by the trade union in formation in question, submitted by Mr Carlos Guerra Nieto, in his capacity as interim Secretary General. The aforementioned application was not approved because, on examining the documents, it was observed that it contained some irregularities which prevent the normal approval procedure for legal personality. The irregularities include the following:()	Article  of the trade union in formation s constitution specifically states that the trade union is a trade organization, and it should be pointed out that agricultural activity encompasses a variety of tasks undertaken, ranging from ploughing, sowing, operating spraying and harvesting machinery to the work of agricultural engineers, hence various activities or specialist skills that are",1,2011,Panama
37,"essential to the agricultural field of activity.()	Furthermore, the applicants (signatories) do not give details of the specialist skills of individuals, limiting themselves merely to noting that they are self-employed, non salaried agricultural workers, residents of Corregimiento de Tort. This fact fails to comply with the requirements for forming social organizations, specifically section () of the Labour Code, which provides that trade unions are: ' . Trade associations, when they are composed of persons from the same profession, trade or specialist skill area;  ?
.Decision No. DM  of  December  ruled that the Agricultural Workers' Union of Corregimiento de Tort should be denied legal personality, which was appealed by the complainant in an application for reconsideration.
.The outcome of the appeal was Decision No.  of  April , which ruled that the contested ministerial decision should be upheld in its entirety, as the characteristics of these workers are not in line with the definition contained in section  of the Labour Code, which reads as follows:  Workers are any natural persons who have the obligation by means of a verbal or written employment contract, individually or as part of a group, explicit or presumed, to provide a service or perform a task while subordinate to or dependent on a person.' 
.It is clear that the petitioners sought to register a trade union composed of workers whose characteristics do not correspond to labour-management relations in accordance with the section invoked. It was therefore deemed appropriate to uphold Decision No. DM  of  December .
.With regard to the denial of legal personality to the SINTEGPPI, the Government states that it was rejected in Decision No. DM  of  March  due to non-compliance with the minimum percentage of initial membership required pursuant to section  of the Labour Code. The decision in question was appealed by the legal representative in an application for reconsideration, alleging that: the MITRADEL has implemented a measure that contravenes section  of the Labour Code; the trade union was already formed, since the request was submitted on  January  and Decision No. DM  of  was handed down on  May ; the MITRADEL has violated the freedom of association, as it accepted resignation letters from some members of the aforementioned organization, and they state that this situation is a direct interference by the ministry s authorities in the exercise of freedom of association; and that the MITRADEL has ignored the fact that the workers provided a membership list of nine workers on  February , disregarding section  of the Labour Code.
.Concerning the arguments put forward by the complainant, the Ministry intends to settle the dispute as follows:()	The plenary session of the Supreme Court of Justice, ruling on an application for constitutional review brought by Mr Sergio Gonzlez, declares that the terms  fifteen calendar days' and  fifteen days' set forth in article  of Act No.  () for the formation of trade unions, which replaces section  of the Labour Code, are unconstitutional.()	Ms Elosa Miller, interim Secretary-General of the trade in formation known as SINTEGPPI, aware of the period allowed in law for applying for legal personality, decides to go to the MITRADEL on  May  and is notified of Decision No. DM  of  March  handed down by the ministry in accordance with the time limits laid down in law.()	Concerning the arguments claiming that the MITRADEL violated the freedom of association, with reference to the resignations tendered by some members of the organization in formation, the Government indicates that there are essentially two converging aspects within the principle of freedom of association: the positive singular aspect, establishing that a person is free to choose to belong to a social organization; and the negative singular aspect, referring to the power of an individual not to join a union, or to resign from an organization when he/she deems it appropriate to do so. On this basis, the MITRADEL accepted the resignations of the workers not wishing to join the organization in formation, respecting the freedom of choice; it is thus not a case of interference, as the legal representative maintained in his allegations of non compliance.()	With regard to the objection stating that the MITRADEL has ignored the fact that the workers provided a membership list of nine workers, the Government considers that such a declaration is illogical, as it was included in the file containing the application for registration of legal personality, as found on page  of the file. The list was provided after the request for legal personality; the persons concerned enjoyed the protection of trade union immunity, a privilege also enjoyed by the founding members, and not as the appellants state in their appeal.()	However, to clarify section  of the Labour Code, it refers to the personal identity cards recorded in the organization s constitution, and not to the membership lists that may arrive after the application has been formalized. The personal identity cards recorded in the constitution were therefore checked against the copies of the personal identity cards provided in this application, from which it was determined that, given all the inconsistencies found during the checking process, in addition to the resignations of five of the founding members of the organization in question, only  of the members who had signed the constitution met the requirements stipulated in the provision on labour, a figure that contravenes section  of the Labour Code, which demands that  the personal identity cards recorded in the constitution shall be checked to ensure at least the minimum number of members required under section ' 
.In view of the above, the MITRADEL, in Decision No. DM - of  June , deemed it appropriate to uphold Decision No. DM  of  March , as there are no grounds for amending it.
.With regard to the rejection of the communication of intent to form a workers' union in  Panama Gaming and Services of Panam SA' and/or  Cirsa Panam SA'  the Government states that, at . a.m. on  April , the letter signed by a group of  workers of  Panama Gaming and Services of Panam SA' and/or  Cirsa Panam SA' was sent to the Department of Social Organizations of the MITRADEL s General Labour Directorate, in which they state their wish to form an enterprise trade union, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. They subsequently forwarded membership lists dated  April and  May  for insertion into the first communication.
.After the technical staff of the Department of Social Organizations had examined the communication, it was deemed not to have met the minimum requirements set forth in section  of the Labour Code, as the provision states as follows:Section . Workers, or their representatives, who are forming a trade union shall, to obtain the protection of trade union immunity, notify the Regional or General Labour Directorate in writing of the group s wish to form the trade union, along with a statement of the names and general information of each person, and the company, establishment or business where they work ' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.Although trade union rules do not prescribe a particular formality to follow in forming a union, the Labour Code sets out certain minimum parameters for its submission, and these are basic guidelines that were followed when registering or accepting the feasibility of applications filed by workers.
.The provision is therefore clear and needs no interpretation, as it stipulates that this notification must come with a statement of the names and general information of each person; it being understood that individuals' general information, apart from their full name, includes personal identity card, address, telephone number, occupation, age, marital status, etc. Moreover, legislation also stipulates that the company, establishment or business where the person works must be described. It is thus clear from the documentation provided by the workers that the signatures are accompanied by the description of only some of the information required under the specific provision, i.e. that the general information (general details) of each person must be completed. The CGTP was therefore informed, in note No. DOS. of  May , addressed to Mr Abelardo Herrera, that the notification submitted to the Department of Social Organizations could not be registered, due to the aforementioned omissions.
.However, another communication was issued, note No.  DOS. of  May , to notify Mr Eric A Batista Ros that the documentation was being returned because it failed to meet the requirements stipulated in section  of the Labour Code.
.It should be noted that on  May , a meeting was convened at the request of the Secretary-General of the CGTP, Mr Mariano Mena, to discuss the issue in question. The meeting was attended by Mr Hernn Garca, Secretary-General, Ms Ada Romero, Director-General of Labour, Mr Rodrigo A Gmez Rodrguez, Head of the Department of Social Organizations, on behalf of the MITRADEL, and a group of workers accompanying Mr Mena. At",-1,2011,Panama
38,"this meeting, the MITRADEL s position with respect to section  of the Labour Code was put forward, and it was explained that the issue could be resolved quickly if the information required were provided to the Ministry, so as to be able to grant the trade union the immunity mentioned in the provision. However, they did not accept the recommendations and chose to lodge an appeal for protection of constitutional rights in the Supreme Court of Justice against the administrative decision contained in note No.  DOS. of  May , issued by the Head of the Department of Social Organizations.
.With regard to the denial of legal personality to the SITEVOP-BALCRIS, the Government states that Messrs Ulises Colina and Manuel Arosemena, representing a group of workers of  Port Outsourcing Services SA'  indicated their intention to form a trade union organization in a letter dated  May . They subsequently submitted a formal application for registration of legal personality on  May .
.However, the Head of the Department of Social Organizations informed them, in note No.  DOS. of  May , that an application for an enterprise trade union had already been filed previously; hence there were legal barriers to continuing with the process and encouraged them to make a new application as an industrial trade organization.
.As is clear from the above, it is not that this group of workers are being prevented from continuing with the process of forming a trade union but that, for the reasons already given in the aforementioned note, they are being informed that under the national legislation two enterprise trade unions cannot exist in the same company.
.Despite this communication and legal barrier, the group of workers proceeded to submit member lists to the Department of Social Organizations, which were received. Subsequently, and in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Labour Code, the General Labour Directorate issued Decision No.  DOS. of  June , the operative part of which provides that:Article : To instruct interested parties in the application for legal personality for the Port Outsourcing Service SA Workers' Union to correct the omissions identified, primarily its name and envisaged activity, to ensure it does not conflict with the organization filing the previous request.
.On  June , Mr Ulises Colina filed an application for reconsideration of the  June  decision. This group of workers continued submitting member lists. However, on  July , Messrs Ulises Colina and Manuel Arosemena, sent the letter dated  July  to the Department of Social Organizations, addressed to Mr Gavino Omar Rodrguez, stating the following:I enclose herewith the corrections requested in accordance with Decision No.  DOS. regarding the formation of our trade union organization, which was intended to be called Port Outsourcing Services SA.
.As is clear in this letter dated  July , the parties concerned corrected the documentation in line with Decision No.  DOS. of  June , confirming that it is not a new application, as evidenced in their extraordinary appeal for the protection of constitutional rights. The MITRADEL therefore, throughout this case, ensured the constitutional and legal rights of the workers and the due process of law called for in this type of process.
.It should be noted that these petitioners continued to pursue legal personality as an enterprise trade union, despite having been informed that it was more appropriate to seek legal personality as an industrial trade union, not least because in April  a previous application had already been made by workers of the  Port Outsourcing Services SA'  This group of workers also simultaneously instigated an application for constitutional review against the  Port Outsourcing Service SA' Workers' Union, file No. -, which halted the process pending a ruling by the plenary session of the Supreme Court.
.This is corroborated in note No.  DOS. of  May , issued by Mr Edgar D ngelo R, Head of the Department of Social Organizations, addressed to HE Alma L Corts Aguilar, Minister of Employment and Labour Development. In the light of this application for constitutional review, the Department of Social Organizations halted the procedure pending the outcome or ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice.
.After some time had elapsed, Mr Ulises Colina submitted the letter dated  March , stating the following:The purpose of this letter is to request you to comply with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code, given that the periods stipulated in sections  and  of the Labour Code have elapsed without comment, as required under section  of the Labour Code. We are therefore requesting you to kindly issue the respective certificate attesting to the existence of the Dock Workers, Checkers and Operators of Balboa and Cristbal Ports Industrial Trade Union (SITEVOP-VALCRIS) and to record the entry and registration of that trade union on the registers of organizations.
.This request, submitted on  March , reflects the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice dismissing the application for constitutional review filed by this group of workers of the trade union currently in formation.
.Decision No. DM - was subsequently handed down on  April , the operative part of which rules not to allow the registration of the request for legal personality of the social organization known as the Dockworkers, Checkers and Operators of Balboa and Cristbal Ports Industrial Trade Union (SITEVOP-VALCRIS). An application for reconsideration was filed against Decision No. DM - of  April , which was settled in Decision No. DM - of  April , upholding, in its entirety, the contested decision.
.With regard to the administrative silence resulting in denial of legal personality to the Health Committee Workers' Trade Union, the Government states that a group of workers of the Health Committee of the San Isidro Health Centre submitted a communication in writing to the MITRADEL, in a letter dated  June , concerning the intention to form an industrial trade union, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. This communication was submitted to, and received on  June  by the Department of Social Organizations. The Director-General of Labour subsequently decided, in Decision No.  DOS. of  July , to return the Health Committee Workers' Trade Union s application for legal personality to the parties concerned to enable them to make the corrections identified within  days of the notification.
.The Department of Social Organizations subsequently received back the corrected documentation from the aforementioned organization, which was duly examined, but it transpired that not all of the omissions identified had been corrected. Consequently, in accordance with section () of the Labour Code, on  August  the Director General of Labour, in Decision No.  DOS., rejected the application for legal personality of the organization in formation.
.In this regard, the operative part of the last paragraph of Decision No.  DOS. stipulates as follows:In accordance with the order contained in the decision in question (Decision No.  DOS.),  of the identity cards of the founding members of this organization were checked. However, it should be noted that, in addition to all the omissions identified not having been corrected, the petitioners at no time confirmed that they were health sector workers, which was an essential and compulsory requirement of section  of the Labour Code to avoid a possible challenge on the grounds of admitting members not meeting the legal requirements.
.Concerning the refusal of the MITRADEL to grant legal personality to the Industrial Trade Union of Panamanian Waterway Workers and Related Industries, the Government states that on  April and on , , ,  and  May , communications were submitted to the Department of Social Organizations to notify it of the wish of a group of workers of the  Panama Ports Company SA' to form a trade union in that company, which were accompanied by members' signatures and their respective identity card numbers. Thereafter, on  May  documentation containing the formal application and registration material were received by the Department of Social Organizations from the social organization in formation called the Industrial Trade Union of Panamanian Waterway Workers and Related Industries, whose interim Secretary-General was Mr Luis Alberto Zrate.
.After examining the documentation, the MITRADEL forwarded the file to the Ministry of the Presidency, in note No. DM - of  June , for its consideration and signature of the respective decision, but it failed to reach the highest authority of the Executive Body.
.Clearly, the measure was not wholly legal because the application for legal personality was not endorsed by the highest competent authority. In this regard, the MITRADEL issued Decision No. DM - of  August , ordering the file of the aforementioned organization to be closed. Mr Luis Alberto Zrate Salazar through his legal representative Mr Martin Gonzlez, filed an application for reconsideration of the decision on the simple grounds that the decision in question was improperly notified, thus rendering it illegal.
.In response to that appeal, the MITRADEL issued Decision No. DM - of  September , ruling",1,2011,Panama
39,"that Decision No. DM - should be upheld in its entirety, which states:After several attempts to locate the Secretary-General of the aforementioned social organization, this authority duly complied with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code, the first paragraph of which states:If the proxy of an existing party in the case who had to be notified in person could not be traced for that purpose, the bearer shall note that on the file, indicating the day and time on which he/she was to hand over the personal notification.
.In this regard, the notification was handed over as per the requirement, contrary to the allegations of the appellant.
.With regard to the alleged illegality of the contested decision, Decision No. DM - states that  the flawed administrative decision occurred because of a failure to implement the provisions of the decision in the application process for legal personality, as upheld in Decision No. DM - of  August ' 
.Following these events, Mr Roberto Mendoza, signatory to the application for legal personality, lodged an appeal for protection of constitutional rights through his legal representative on  June , with the Supreme Court of Justice on the grounds that those rights were not provided for in note No. - of  March , issued by the Department of Social Organizations of the MITRADEL s General Labour Directorate.
.This appeal was acknowledged in a decision of  July , informing the General Labour Directorate and ordering it to report on action taken, as the notification in question was not the responsibility of the General Labour Directorate, but the public official mandated to take the action described above, i.e. the incumbent Head of the Department of Social Organizations, which is why it is deemed to be a violation of the due process of law.
.In this regard, article  of the Judicial Code clearly stipulates as follows:Any person against whom an order to do or not to do is issued or enforced by any public official which violates the rights and guarantees enshrined in the Constitution shall have the right for the order to be revoked upon his/her request or that of any other person ' The appeal for protection of constitutional rights to which this article refers shall be processed by way of a summary proceeding and shall fall under the jurisdiction of the judicial courts.
.The foregoing stipulates that the responsibility for issuing a ruling on an appeal for protection of constitutional rights does not fall to the plenary session of the Supreme Court because the official respondent does not have the authority and jurisdiction throughout the Republic of Panama or in two or more provinces in accordance with article () of the Judicial Code.
.Without distinction, the plenary session of the Supreme Court of Justice, in the operative part of the decision of  October , granted the appeal lodged and ordered the list of new members to be accepted and the existence of the organization in question to be certified. The Department of Social Organizations complied with the order to accept the list of new members.
.However, Mr Luis Alberto Zrate Salazar, through his legal representative Mr Martin Gonzlez, filed a motion of contempt against the MITRADEL on the grounds of non compliance with the order of the decision of  October , handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice, on certifying the existence of the aforementioned organization (case file No. -, which remains unresolved in the highest judicial authority).
.In this regard, the Government states that is clearly important to draw attention to the fact that the aforementioned order is inconsistent and clearly confusing, in that the MITRADEL cannot certify the existence of the aforementioned organization (a task carried out by the Department of Social Organizations) if the existence of this organization has still not been established in law (this occurs when a trade union organization in formation has been certified (for the purpose of registering its legal personality) by the President of the Republic), which was not done in this particular case.
.The Ministry of Employment and Labour Development is therefore not in contempt, as the applicant claims in the aforementioned case, since the Ministry accepted a list of the organization s new members, as ordered by the plenary session of the Supreme Court, and in no way did the latter order that registration of legal personality should be granted to the social organization in question.
.The Government points out that the denial of legal personality to the aforementioned trade unions in formation has nothing to do with Government policy, but is due to non compliance with the procedural requirements for obtaining legal personality.
.Lastly, with regard to the allegation concerning the rejection of two lists of dispute grievances, submitted for the purpose of collective bargaining by the Hotel, Gastronomy and Tourism Workers' Trade Union, made against two companies, the Government states that in one case seven of the eight workers who supported the list ceased supporting it and, in the other case, the trade union in question addressed the list of dispute grievances to a slot machine company whose activity is at odds with that of the trade union.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant alleges that the Ministry of Employment and Labour Development prevented the formation of six trade union organizations in different sectors in violation of Convention No.  and the Labour Code. The complainant sent a copy of the administrative decisions and the outcome of the appeals lodged and points out that section  of the Labour Code provides that objections to the application for registration of a trade union may only be made if the intended purpose is not laid down in legislation, if it was not formed with the minimum legal number of members or if the legally required documentation is not submitted in the correct form. The complainant also alleges that the workers who signed the intention to form two of the six trade unions in question were dismissed.
.The Committee notes that the Government states that these refusals to register or grant legal personality to trade union organizations in formation are due to non-compliance with legislation or irregularities and that they are not due to any State policy, as the State recognizes and values the principle of freedom of association as a fundamental right. The Government adds that the trade unions in formation lodged legal appeals, which were processed in accordance with the law.
.The Committee observes that the substantive grounds for denial of legal personality are as follows:' with regard to the Agricultural Workers' Union of Corregimiento de Tort, the main grounds for denying legal personality are that its members are self-employed, non salaried workers, while the concept of a worker under the Labour Code refers to natural persons who have the obligation to provide a service or perform a task  while subordinate to or dependent on a person' ' with regard to the SINTEGPPI, the grounds for denying legal recognition are that the trade union in formation did not meet the legal requirement for minimum membership and that workers who subsequently join do not count, and in particular, that five founding members resigned, leaving only  workers who were founding members of the trade union, which did not comply with the legal requirements;' with regard to the workers of  Panama Gaming and Services of Panam SA' and/or  Cirsa Panam SA'  the grounds for rejecting the communication of intent to form a trade union were that the communication should, according to legislation, have contained the following general information: full name; personal identity card; address; telephone number; occupation; age; marital status; etc., and a description of the company or business where the person works. The Committee notes that the Ministry of Labour invited those concerned to complete this information, but they chose to lodge an appeal for protection of constitutional rights in the Supreme Court of Justice;' with regard to the denial of legal personality to the SITEVOP-BALCRIS, the grounds for denial were the existence of a previous application (by other workers) to form an enterprise trade union, as according to legislation there cannot be two enterprise trade unions in the same company (although it could form an industrial trade union);' with regard to the denial of legal personality (by way of administrative silence) to the Health Committee Workers' Trade Union, the grounds for denial are that they could not form an industrial trade union because the applicants failed to prove that they are health sector workers;' with regard to the denial of legal personality to the Industrial Trade Union of Panamanian Waterway Workers and Related Industries, the grounds for denial were that the application for legal personality was not endorsed by the highest competent authority (the President of the Republic); the applicants lodged an appeal for protection of constitutional rights before the Supreme Court of Justice, an appeal that was granted, and on the basis of which the Ministry of Labour accepted the list of new members of the trade union, but it",-1,2011,Panama
40,"failed to certify the existence of the trade union because the Ministry of Labour cannot, according to the Government, certify the existence of the organization in question as it still has not been established in law because the registration of the organization has not been endorsed by the President of the Republic.
.The Committee takes note with deep concern a number of the reasons given by the Government for refusing to register or grant legal personality to the six trade union organizations in formation mentioned in the complaint.
.The Committee considers that the different legal requirements or their interpretation in practice in this case appear to have contravened Article  of Convention No.  under which workers without distinction whatsoever and without previous authorization have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing. Article  of Convention No.  enshrines the principle of non-interference by the authorities. In that regard, the Committee emphasizes that, although the requirement for simple formalities for the formation of trade union organizations is compatible with Convention No. , it is contrary to Convention No.  to prevent trade unions of self-employed workers who are not subordinate to, or dependent on, a person, to prevent two enterprise trade unions coexisting, to make the granting of legal personality subject to the approval of the President of the Republic, to demand information from the founders of an organization such as their telephone number, marital status or home address (this indirectly excludes from membership workers with no fixed abode or those who cannot afford to pay for a telephone), to allow unexpected resignations by member workers (in the documents attached to the complaint, the complainant implies that they had been induced) resulting in the trade union in formation failing to have the minimum legal number of members. The Committee also observes that in Case No.  the complainant (including CONATO ' which is the most important trade union organization in the country) alleged that  applications for trade union registration were  frozen' by the authorities.
.Therefore the Committee, on the one hand, urges the Government to adopt measures to amend legislation to bring it in line with Convention No.  and, as it has already done with regard to Case No. , the Committee requests the Government, including the administrative authorities, to examine, with the complainants in a proactive and constructive manner, the reasons for this situation so as to assess how the system is working in practice and how to resolve the issue of registration or access to legal personality for trade union organizations whose registration has been denied. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.
.The Committee also understands that some of the cases of denial of legal personality have been submitted to the judicial authority and requests the Government to inform it of the decisions handed down.
.With regard to the allegations that the workers who signed the intention to form the SINTEGPPI and those who signed the intention to form a workers' trade union in  Panama Gaming and Services of Panam' and/or  Cirsa Panam SA' were dismissed, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent detailed comments on these serious allegations and, recalling that pursuant to Article  of Convention No. , it is expressly prohibited to  cause the dismissal of, or otherwise prejudice, a worker by reason of union membership'  the Committee urges the Government, should the allegations be verified, to take steps to reinstate the workers of both trade unions immediately and compensate them for their losses (salaries and benefits) and to keep it informed thereof.
.Lastly, with regard to the allegation concerning the rejection of two lists of dispute grievances, submitted for the purpose of collective bargaining by the Hotel, Gastronomy and Tourism Workers' Trade Union made against two companies, the Committee notes that the Government states that, in one case, seven of the eight workers who supported the list ceased supporting it, and, in the other case, the trade union in question addressed the list of dispute grievances to a slot machine company whose activity does not correspond to the scope of the trade union.
.In view of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee takes note with deep concern a number of the reasons given by the Government for refusing to register or grant legal personality to the six trade union organizations in formation mentioned in the complaint. The Committee considers that the different legal requirements or their interpretation in practice in this case appear to have contravened Article  of Convention No.  under which workers without distinction whatsoever and without previous authorization have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing.(b)	The Committee, on the one hand, urges the Government to adopt measures to amend legislation to bring it in line with Convention No.  and, as it has already done with regard to Case No. , the Committee requests the Government, including the administrative authorities, to examine with the complainants in a proactive and constructive manner the reasons for this situation so as to assess how the system is working in practice and how to resolve the issue of registration or access to legal personality for trade union organizations whose registration has been denied. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(c)	The Committee also understands that some of the cases of denial of legal personality have been submitted to the judicial authority and requests the Government to inform it of the decisions handed down.(d)	Lastly, with regard to the allegations that the workers who signed the intention to form the SINTEGPPI and those who signed the intention to form a workers' trade union in  Panama Gaming and Services of Panam' and/or  Cirsa Panam SA' were dismissed, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent detailed comments on these serious allegations and, recalling that pursuant to Article  of Convention No.  it is expressly prohibited to  cause the dismissal of, or otherwise prejudice, a worker by reason of union membership'  the Committee urges the Government, should the allegations be verified, to take steps to reinstate the workers of both trade unions immediately and compensate them for their losses (salaries and benefits) and to keep it informed thereof.",1,2011,Panama
41,".The Committee last examined the substance of this case at its March  meeting, when it made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee firmly expects that the future reform of the Act governing administrative careers will reduce the minimum number of public servants needed to establish a trade union association.(b)	The Committee reiterates once again the importance of recognizing FENASEP for all purposes (this includes it being represented on the Technical Committee and the Appeal and Conciliation Committee in the light of Act No.  of ) in connection with its representativeness and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments and to take the necessary measures to ensure that its legislation recognizes the right to establish federations and confederations in the public sector. Furthermore, the Committee notes that, as regards the refusal to allocate education insurance funds to FENASEP for training, the Government is waiting for the Third Administrative Division of the Supreme Court of Justice to provide clarification on the matter. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c)	As regards the alleged freezing of  requests for trade union registration, bearing in mind the number of denied requests for legal personality, the Committee requests the Government to examine the grounds for denial with the organizations so that the functioning of the system in practice can be evaluated, including the means of resolving the issue of securing legal personality for the  trade union organizations in question. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d)	The Committee notes that the Government is awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the dismissal of the leader of ASEMITRABS, Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz (the Government disputes his appointment as leader of the association and underlines the fact that the association in question has not been operational for years). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(e)	The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government, and in particular the fact that the legal proceedings instituted by the Ministry of Labour against trade union leaders for mismanagement of funds (illicit diversion of public education insurance funds earmarked for trade union training) are ongoing. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the judicial decision taken in this regard.(f)	Finally, the Committee notes the Government s observations dated  February  sent in response to the information transmitted by FENASEP on  May  concerning dismissals of trade union leaders and other matters, which will be examined at the next examination of the case.
.In a communication dated  August , the National Federation of Public Employees and Public Service Enterprise Workers (FENASEP) alleges that: () the freedom of association situation has deteriorated; () the cases where new trade unions have been denied legal personality by the Government have not been reviewed; () the payment of the State subsidy for training was recently re-established, although the legal proceedings brought in this regard before the Supreme Court in  by the Ministry of Labour have not been formally withdrawn; () the trade union leaders in the public sector who were unfairly dismissed have not been reinstated but, on the contrary, Ms Jennyfer Malca, FENASEP Executive Board Secretary for youth issues, Ms Melanie Guittens, FENASEP executive board member, Mr Ismael Ruiz, FENASEP Executive Board Secretary for education and Mr Andrs Rodrguez, education official, were further dismissed; () no inquiry has been made into the murder of the trade unionists in Changuinola, who were killed by the police in ; () the management of the Social Security Fund continues to deny freedom of association; () through the assistance of the ILO, two tripartite dialogue forums were established in February  to bring legislation into line with Convention Nos  and  as far as possible, and another forum was established to seek to provide rapid solutions to disputes arising in relation to freedom of association (a number of agreements have been reached which have not yet been enforced or have only been enforced in part); and () a subcommittee made up of government and FENASEP members was created to bring the text of Act No.  governing administrative careers into line as regards freedom of association. The subcommittee has been operating since May  but has yet to produce results.
.In its communication of  February , in relation to the allegations concerning anti union dismissals submitted by FENASEP in May , the Government reports that: () Mr Alba did not have trade union immunity; () Mr Alba and Mr Eduardo Baltazar Lan were dismissed on the grounds that they were not in good standing with the Social Security Fund (non-compliance with requirements as members of the executive board of the Fund); () Mr Andrs Gndola was absent from duty, without permission, from  to  May , and thus a decision was issued requesting his dismissal on the grounds of dereliction of duty. Mr Gndola lodged an appeal before the administrative courts that is currently being processed; () Mr Abdiel Zapateiro was dismissed under Staff Decree No.  of  December , and his appeal for review was rejected, indicating that he was not a union leader; () Mr Reynaldo Nez Castillo was dismissed from the Banco Hipotecario Nacional under Decision No. - of  February , as a result of the functional and structural reorganization carried out throughout the institution. Mr Nez Castillo lodged administrative appeals, which were rejected, and may bring his case before the judicial authorities; and () Ms Ana Bolena Ayarza, journalist for the Public Relations Office of the National Police of Coln was not unfairly dismissed, but was a temporary employee; she was not a union leader of any public sector trade union.
.In its communication of  October , the Government indicates the following with regard to the recommendations made by the Committee:' Recommendation (a): (i) In the framework of the social dialogue conducted in the committees on the Panama tripartite agreement of  February , the labour subcommittee on administrative careers of the Committee on the Implementation of the Tripartite Agreement is in operation; and (ii) the subcommittee has been addressing all matters relating to administrative careers in search of legal measures to align the legislation in force with Conventions Nos  and .' Recommendation (b): (i) FENASEP is an organization that is recognized in the public sector; and (ii) the subsidy for trade union training has been re-established with FENASEP and with the General Union of Workers (UGT), and the month of July  has already been paid.' Recommendation (c): (i) All the requests for legal personality were answered via reasoned decisions and the Department for Trade Union Organizations is not in default in this respect; (ii) the requests for registration in question were rejected and were not corrected by the applicants; and (iii) the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling denying the requests for legal personality.' Recommendation (d): The Government is awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court in relation to the dismissal of the ASEMITRABS union official, Mr Victor Castillo.' Recommendation (e): (i) On  June  the First Anti-corruption Prosecutor s Office ordered that statements be taken from a number of unionists; (ii) under the instructions issued by the Prosecutor s Office the use of funds allocated to trade union training was examined and it was found that the list of course participants provided by some trade unions included deceased persons and new born children, as well as the use of funds to pay for alcohol, telephone bills, cable television in private residences, etc.; (iii) to date, the case continues before the Public Prosecutor s Office, which is carrying out investigations in order to submit its report to the judiciary; and (iv) as a result of tripartite dialogue between sectors, the Minister submitted a request before the Prosecutor s Office for the withdrawal of the proceedings, which was not accepted by the Public Prosecutor s Office.
.Lastly, in its communication of  November , the Government refers to the new allegations presented by FENASEP and reports the following: () tripartite dialogue is operating in the committees on the Panama tripartite agreement (Committee on the Implementation of the Tripartite Agreement and the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints) as well as the subcommittee on administrative careers to address matters related to freedom of association; () under the dialogue process, with the assistance of the ILO, three agreements were signed in the tripartite dialogue committees and Dr Rolando Murgas Torraza was elected by consensus as moderator; () the subcommittee in charge of bringing the Act governing administrative careers into line with Conventions Nos  and  has been meeting since May  and to date has produced a progress report, establishing the list of matters to be addressed, with a view to reaching consensus as regards the amendment of the Act; () the new unions were denied legal personality because they did not meet the requirements established in the Labour Code. The",1,2009,Panama
42,"applicants have not submitted the required corrections; () Ms Melanie Yvette Guittens de Salazar was dismissed in accordance with the administrative authority s power of free discretional appointment and dismissal. She was not an administrative career employee, and she was not a member of the FENASEP executive board or of the Association of Employees of the Administration of the Coln Free Trade Zone, and she did not have trade union immunity, which would have prevented the action adopted; () Mr Andrs Rodrguez Olmos, Secretary-General of the Association of Teachers of the Republic of Panama has not been dismissed from his position. The sanction that was issued for his dismissal (following a disciplinary inquiry which followed due process) is formally suspended as a result of an appeal lodged by the sanctioned party and which is currently pending; () the case of Mr Ismael Ruiz is currently before the Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining, for its tripartite consideration; () in the case of Ms Jennifer Malca, information has been requested from the Sports Institute of Panama; () as regards the acts of violence in the city of Changuinola, the trade unions SITRAIBANA, SITRAPBI, Comit Ocho de Julio (Committee of the Eighth of July), SITRAEMBA, SUNTRACS and the National Government signed a settlement on  August  concluding the negotiations and agreeing not to submit any complaints in respect of the events of  July . Likewise,  people affected during the events were accorded monthly financial support on humanitarian grounds until their retirement; and () as regards the claim that the Social Security Fund continues to deny freedom of association, the Government reports that the institution respects freedom of association, engaging in dialogue with more than  existing trade union organizations in the Fund and in May  agreements were signed to bring a strike to an end.
.The Committee takes note of all this information. The Committee firmly expects that the committees and subcommittees that were established through the tripartite agreement signed in February  will produce tangible results in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. It also requests the Government to keep it informed of: () the result of the legal proceedings concerning the dismissals of the unionists Mr Andrs Gndola, Mr Victor Castillo and Mr Andrs Rodrguez Olmos; () the result of the handling of the case in the committee on complaints related to freedom of association concerning the dismissal of the unionist Mr Ismael Ruiz; () the employment situation of the unionist Ms Jennifer Malca; and () the result of the investigation being carried out by the First Anti-corruption Prosecutor s Office on the use of funds for trade union training.
.More generally, the Committee has observed in different cases related to Panama that the legal provisions governing trade union rights in the public sector are subject to significant restrictions. For example, in a case examined in its meeting of March  [see th Report, Case No. , paras ' ] indication is made that provisions are needed that protect public servants against acts of anti-union discrimination or interference, and clearly recognize the right to collective bargaining of public servants who are not engaged in the administration of the State. The Committee observes that this case also illustrates that the creation of trade unions in the public sector encounters obstacles in practice. The Committee requests the Government to submit these matters to tripartite dialogue and to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ). The National Federation of Public Employees and Public Service Enterprise Workers (FENASEP) sent additional information by communication dated  May .
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  December  and responded to the FENASEP communication of  May  in a communication dated  February .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	As to the allegations regarding Act No.  of  June , establishing a special regime for the area of Bar, which includes a provision allowing enterprises to operate for the first six years without undertaking bargaining processes concerning collective labour agreements (section  of the Act), the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to repeal the abovementioned section  without delay. Furthermore, noting that the Government has not responded to the allegation made by the complainants with regards to said Act, according to which, the representatives of the workers' central CONATO and the employers' central CONEP are not represented on the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar, the Committee recalls the importance of consultation with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations with regards labour issues, requests the Government to consider, together with those organizations, the possibility of the latter being represented on the Administration Committee, in order that they might be consulted on issues affecting their members, and to keep it informed in this regard.(b)	As to the allegations regarding a Manual of Procedures for the Department of Social Organizations (ministerial ruling of  December ), which according to the complainants restricts the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee notes that the text of the Manual (copy provided by the Government) does not seem to have been subject to consultations with the most representative trade union organizations. Rather, it is claimed that the Manual consists of a series of flexible procedures aimed at speeding up the administrative process and the Government is ready to consider any recommendations that might arise from its application. The Committee finds that certain terms employed in the Manual, such as the  approval' of executive committees, may give rise to problems of interpretation and requests the Government to examine said Manual with the most representative workers' organizations in order to clear up any misunderstandings and produce a text which enjoys as much support as possible.(c)	As to the alleged increase of the minimum number of public servants needed to establish a trade union association in the public sector ( servants) in the light of Act No. , the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend Act No.  in order to reduce the minimum number of public servants necessary to establish a trade union association, given that an excessively high minimum number could restrict trade union rights, in particular in certain public institutions and small municipalities. As to the allegation that, in the light of Act No.  of , public servants dismissed unfairly and then reinstated through a ruling do not have the right to receive the lost wages for the period between the moment of separation and that of reinstatement, the Committee notes the Government s statement that this allegation is groundless and notes that the Government backs up this claim by referring to two Supreme Court rulings obliging the State to pay the wages and other benefits. The Committee notes that the Government only sent one of the rulings, dated  February , when, in fact, Act No.  was adopted in . The Committee would therefore be grateful if the Government would send other rulings supporting its statement.(d)	As to the allegations regarding the public servants' organization FENASEP i.e. refusal by the authorities to recognize FENASEP in practice, despite the fact that FENASEP representatives have participated in the ILC as delegates on several occasions, exclusion of representatives of this organization from the Technical Committee and the Appeal and Conciliation Committee in the light of Act No.  of  July , denial of education insurance funds (trade union training) previously enjoyed by FENASEP ' (despite the fact that all public servants have . per cent deducted from their salaries for the education insurance, thus discriminating between trade union associations of public servants and private sector trade unions), the Committee requests the Government to initiate a constructive dialogue with FENASEP in order to find a solution to the problems which will avoid any risk of discrimination against the organization while allowing it to be recognized for all purposes in connection with its representativeness.(e)	As to the allegation that the Ministry of Labour has frozen  requests for trade union registration over the past ten months, the Committee requests the Government to indicate those trade unions which have not been registered despite the fact that they have submitted applications for registration and to communicate the reasoned administrative rulings behind the non-registration of trade union organizations.(f)	As to the dismissal of Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz (according to the allegations, the General Secretary of the Association of Employees of ASEMITRABS) in violation of",0,2009,Panama
43,"Act No.  on the protection of trade union leaders (trade union immunity), the Committee request the Government to communicate the result of the appeal lodged against the dismissal of Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz and, given that the Government disputes his appointment as Secretary General and even the existence of his association of public employees (despite the fact that the complainant organizations have sent a public instrument drawn up by a solicitor which vouches for ASEMITRABS' establishment and executive committee), to indicate whether said association has applied for registration and legal personality and, should that be the case, to indicate the reasons why that application was unsuccessful.(g)	The Committee requests the Government to send it copies of any rulings or charges brought by the Public Ministry against trade union leaders for illicit diversion of public education insurance funds earmarked for trade union training.(h)	Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has been examining the possibility of establishing a higher labour council as a consultative body in order to promote social dialogue concerning labour issues with the technical support of the ILO, and that it has formally requested ILO technical assistance in harmonizing national legislation and practice with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  (the Government highlights that request in the part of this document regarding the allegations affecting FENASEP). The Committee expresses the firm hope that said technical assistance will be established in the very near future.
.In its communication dated  December , the Government refers to the Committee s recommendation (a) contained in its th Report and states that Act No.  of  April  repealed Act No.  of  June  (including section , which allowed enterprises in the area of Bar to operate for the first six years without undertaking collective bargaining in order to align its legislation with ILO Convention Nos  and . The repeal is the result of the agreements of the special tripartite committee for the forum for dialogue set up by the Government.
.As regards the Committee s recommendation (b), the Government states that in , the Ministry of Labour and Social Development will carry out a comprehensive review of the Manual of Procedures for trade union organizations, which will provide an opportunity for intervention and making suggestions to confederations, trade union centres, federations and other organizations; that will encourage them to participate in the process and will better assist them in their various trade union procedures.
.As regards the Committee s recommendation (c), in which it finds the minimum number of  public servants needed to establish a trade union association in the public sector (pursuant to Act No.  of ) to be excessive, the Government states that the objective of the reform committee for the Act governing administrative careers is to amend the relevant section to provide as follows:  there may be more than one trade union association within a public institution'  This amendment will then be submitted to the executive body to be studied and given due consideration. The Government adds that the objective of the reform committee for the Act governing administrative careers is also to amend section  of Act No.  of  July  to enable all public servants, including non career public servants, as well as those freely appointed pursuant to the Constitution, those appointed following a selection process and those already serving to freely establish a trade union organization or association. These amendments will be submitted to the executive body for due study and consideration.
.As regards the second part of the Committee s recommendation (c) concerning the allegation according to which, by virtue of Act No.  of , public servants dismissed and then reinstated through a ruling did not have the right to receive lost wages, the Government states that if a worker employed by a State institution is dismissed and reinstated, he or she immediately receives the salary and is paid any lost wages in keeping with the budget of each public institution. Should this prove to be insufficient, budgetary funds may be raised to pay the corresponding amount.
.As regards recommendation (d) concerning the non-recognition of the public servant organization FENASEP, the Government states that the Federation is not currently registered as such according to the records of legal personality of the Department of Social Organizations, the General Labour Department of the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development (MITRADEL). FENASEP was established and granted legal personality by the Ministry of the Interior in  but was subsequently regulated by Act No.  of , which governs public servants in the administrative careers system. Section  of the Labour Code provides as follows:Section . The provisions of this Code are of a public nature and are binding on all persons, whether individuals or juridical persons, corporations, farms and establishments that are located or established within the national territory. Public employees shall be governed by the norms of the administrative careers system, except in cases where it is expressly determined that the precepts of this Code shall apply thereto.
.Similarly, on  April  the High Court of Justice ruled on a previous case involving the same parties, underlining, among other things, the following:Consequently, this High Court considers that the labour provisions contained in the Labour Code do not apply to the National Finance Corporation, given that is it a State body legally established by law and is therefore excluded from labour legislation in accordance with section  of the Labour Code and section  of Act No.  of  December  [...]
.The Government adds that the Third Administrative Division of the Supreme Court of Justice endorsed the aforementioned ruling by a judicial decision taken on  May . Therefore, in view of this ruling, the MITRADEL is not acting arbitrarily by refusing to grant legal personality to a public sector federation, given that to do so would constitute an illegal act that could entail legal consequences for the administration when the highest judicial authority has already taken a decision on the matter. This is the reason why FENASEP is not recognized and not because of an arbitrary decision on the part of the Government or the Minister for Labour as alleged by the complainants. The Government must abide by the principle of legality and the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice.
.As regards the refusal to allocate education insurance funds to FENASEP for training, the Government states that it is waiting for the Third Administrative Division of the Supreme Court of Justice to provide clarification on the matter.
.The Government adds that it is examining the possibility of setting up a bipartite forum for dialogue between the Ministry of Labour and FENASEP representatives in order to address and resolve issues relating to the public sector.
.As regards the Committee s recommendation (e) concerning the alleged freezing of  requests for trade union registration, the Government states that this allegation is entirely false, given that the denial of legal personality to trade unions in the process of being established stemmed from their failure to meet the relevant legal requirements, which was communicated via reasoned administrative decisions. Therefore, in this case, it was not a question of a failure to reply, especially when the law establishes a period of  working days in which to do so. The Government does not keep a full list of the trade unions to which legal personality has been denied but highlights six cases in which it observed irregularities: the Agricultural Workers Union of Tort, the Union of Gaming Properties of Panama Inc., the Workers Union of Panama Gaming Services of Panam S.A. and/or Cirsa Panam S.A., the Union of Workers, Stevedores, Controllers and Operators of the Ports of Balboa and Cristbal, the Workers Union of the Committee for Health and the Industrial Workers Union for Water Transport in Panama.
.As regards recommendation (f) concerning the dismissal of Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz, as alleged by the General Secretary of the Association of Employees of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (ASEMITRABS), the Government states that it is awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice on the appeal lodged by Mr Castillo Daz who, according to the Government, appointed himself as the General Secretary of ASEMITRABS knowing full well that this association was not functioning and that the majority of public servants were unaware of its existence, as it had not been operational since the end of . The association has not been operational in practice since then and, at the time of the  elections, a number of public servants close to the Government of the time decided to revive the association in order to seek refuge in the immunity enjoyed by trade union officials. Having failed to achieve the ends that had justified its revival, the aforementioned association once again ceased functioning and remained non-operational until the end of the  elections when, once again, public servants close to the Government attempted to revive the association so as to avail themselves of",1,2009,Panama
44,"trade union immunity. The Government reiterates that the association in question was never actually operational in practice, nor is it recognized at the institutional level or by the very public servants of the Ministry (including those who have served for more than  years) but has been used strategically during the periods of transition from one Government to another by a number of public servants for purely personal gain, namely to seek refuge in the immunity acquired on becoming a member of such an association. As things stand, in legal terms, this association still exists but is not operational in practice or recognized by the public servants of the institution.
.As regards the Committee s recommendation (g) requesting copies of any rulings or charges brought by the Public Prosecution Service against trade union leaders for illicit diversion of public education insurance funds earmarked for trade union training, the Government recalls that it lodged a complaint with the Attorney-General s Office against the trade union leaders for mismanagement of funds and the possible misuse of trade union training funds allocated by the Panamanian Institute for Labour Studies (IPEL) to various trade union confederations and federations. The Government adds that Prosecutorial Order No.  of  September  requested the judge to call a provisional, impersonal and objective stay of proceedings on behalf of the Public Prosecution Service. Subsequently, the tenth Criminal Circuit Court of Panama granted the request for a provisional stay of proceedings made by the First Anti-corruption Prosecutor s Office. This was then followed by the Ministry of Labour lodging a complaint on  March  requesting the resumption of proceedings, which was granted by means of Decision No. - of  April . The legal proceedings are currently under way.
.As regards the Committee s recommendation (h), the Government states that it is examining the possibility of establishing a tripartite higher labour council but that a decision has yet to be taken since a consensus on the subject has not yet been reached. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Labour and Social Development will conclude a collaborative agreement with the Labour Foundation led by employers' and workers' organizations), which will allow the institution to become a tripartite body and an institutional forum for permanent social dialogue concerning labour issues aimed at seeking out mutually agreed ways to allay the concerns of social actors and to address major social challenges, including the handling of trade union complaints and labour disputes, in addition to mutually-agreed ways of harmonizing national legislation and practices with the relevant ILO Conventions.
.Recommendation (a) of the Committee s th Report. The Committee notes with satisfaction that, in its reply, the Government states that Act No.  of  April  repealed Act No.  of  June , including section , which allowed enterprises in the area of Bar to operate for the first six years without undertaking collective bargaining. The Committee notes that this repeal, which follows up the Committee s recommendation, was the result of a tripartite agreement. The Committee understands that, since the Act in question has been repealed, the pending matter of the non-representation of trade union and employer representatives on the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar instituted under the henceforth repealed Act has been resolved.
.As regards recommendation (b), the Committee notes with interest the Government s decision to carry out a comprehensive review of the Manual of Procedures for trade union organizations in , thereby involving trade union organizations across the country. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case.
.As regards recommendation (c), in which it found the minimum number of  public servants needed to establish a trade union association in the public sector to be excessive, the Committee welcomes the Government s statement to the effect that the objective of the reform committee for the Act governing administrative careers is to amend the current legal norm to provide as follows:  there may be more than one association within a public institution'  The Committee takes note of the will shown by the Government to align its legislation with Convention Nos  and  and, just as it did in its previous examination of the case, firmly expects that the future reform will reduce the excessive minimum number of public servants needed to establish a trade union association. Lastly, the Committee notes that this matter is subject to follow-up by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.As regards the second part of recommendation (c) concerning a request for information, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement reiterating that workers dismissed and then reinstated do have the right to receive lost wages. Bearing in mind that the trade union organizations do not subscribe to the Government s explanation or, at the very least, have expressed reservations, the Committee once again requests the Government to send a copy of recent rulings supporting its statement.
.As regards recommendation (d) requesting the recognition of the organization FENASEP, the Committee notes that in accordance with the aforementioned legislation and jurisprudence, it would be illegal to grant legal personality to a public sector federation. The Committee wishes to underline that this situation is incompatible with the right of workers to freely establish worker organizations of their own choosing (Article  of Convention No. ), including the right to establish federations and confederations (Articles  and  of Convention No. ). The Committee welcomes the fact that the Government is examining the possibility of setting up a forum for dialogue with FENASEP to address and resolve issues relating to the public sector. While it takes note of the Government s statement that FENASEP is not registered according to the records of legal personality of the Ministry of Labour (it was established and granted legal personality by the Ministry of the Interior in ), the Committee recalls that FENASEP has participated in various ILO Conferences and reiterates once again the importance of recognizing FENASEP for all purposes (this includes it being represented on the Technical Committee and the Appeal and Conciliation Committee in the light of Act No.  of ) in connection with its representativeness and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments and to take the necessary measures to ensure that its legislation recognizes the right to establish federations and confederations in the public sector. Furthermore, the Committee notes that, as regards the refusal to allocate education insurance funds to FENASEP for training, the Government is waiting for the Third Administrative Division of the Supreme Court of Justice to provide clarification on the matter. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards recommendation (e) concerning the alleged freezing of  requests for trade union registration, the Committee takes note of the Government s explanation that it is not a question of  freezing' or of a failure to reply, given that the law establishes a period of  working days for the Ministry of Labour to do so, but of a refusal to grant legal personality owing to the relevant legal requirements not being met. The Government refers to six cases as examples in which irregularities were observed. Bearing in mind that, according to the allegations, the number of denied requests for legal personality stands at  organizations, the Committee requests the Government to examine the grounds for denial with the complainants so as to evaluate how the system functions in practice and the best way to resolve the issue of securing legal personality for the  trade union organizations in question. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments. [These matters are also examined in Case No.  concerning six alleged cases of denied registration.]
.As regards recommendation (f), the Committee notes that the Government is awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the dismissal of the leader of ASEMITRABS, Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz. The Government disputes his appointment as leader of the association and underlines the fact that the association in question has not been operational for years. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.As regards recommendation (g), the Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government, and in particular the fact that the legal proceedings instituted by the Ministry of Labour against trade union leaders for mismanagement of funds (illicit diversion of public education insurance funds earmarked for trade union training) are ongoing. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the judicial decision taken in this respect.
.As regards recommendation (h), the Committee notes with interest the Government s statements to the effect that a collaborative agreement is to be concluded with the Labour Foundation, which is led by employers' and workers' organizations, which will allow the institution to become a tripartite body and an institutional forum for permanent social dialogue to address all social challenges, including the handling",-1,2009,Panama
45,"of trade union complaints and labour disputes.
.Finally, the Committee notes the Government s observations dated  February  sent in response to the information transmitted by FENASEP on  May  concerning dismissals of trade union leaders and other matters, which will be examined at the next examination of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee welcomes the progress reported by the Government, particularly on the legislative matters, and invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee firmly expects that the future reform of the Act governing administrative careers will reduce the minimum number of public servants needed to establish a trade union association.(b)	The Committee reiterates once again the importance of recognizing FENASEP for all purposes (this includes it being represented on the Technical Committee and the Appeal and Conciliation Committee in the light of Act No.  of ) in connection with its representativeness and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments and to take the necessary measures to ensure that its legislation recognizes the right to establish federations and confederations in the public sector. Furthermore, the Committee notes that, as regards the refusal to allocate education insurance funds to FENASEP for training, the Government is waiting for the Third Administrative Division of the Supreme Court of Justice to provide clarification on the matter. The Committee requests the Government to keep informed in this respect.(c)	As regards the alleged freezing of  requests for trade union registration, bearing in mind the number of denied requests for legal personality, the Committee requests the Government to examine the grounds for denial with the organizations so that the functioning of the system in practice can be evaluated, including the means of resolving the issue of securing legal personality for the  trade union organizations in question. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d)	The Committee notes that the Government is awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the dismissal of the leader of ASEMITRABS, Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz (the Government disputes his appointment as leader of the association and underlines the fact that the association in question has not been operational for years). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(e)	The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government, and in particular the fact that the legal proceedings instituted by the Ministry of Labour against trade union leaders for mismanagement of funds (illicit diversion of public education insurance funds earmarked for trade union training) are ongoing. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the judicial decision taken in this regard.(f)	Finally, the Committee notes the Government s observations dated  February  sent in response to the information transmitted by FENASEPT on  May  concerning dismissals of trade union leaders and other matters, which will be examined at the next examination of the case.
.The complaints are contained in communications of the National Federation of Public Employees and Public Service Enterprise Workers (FENASEP) and the National Council of Organized Workers (CONATO) respectively dated  November  and  June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May,  November and  December .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , FENASEP alleges that, on  July , the Government enacted Act No. , reforming Act No. , of , and Act No. , of , respectively, structuring administrative and legislative careers. Act No.  eliminates tripartism, given that the previous act was based on the fundamental principle that the representatives of public servants on the Technical Committee and the Appeal and Conciliation Committee would be nominated by FENASEP. Act No.  eliminates this possibility.
.Despite the fact that the ILO supervisory bodies have urged that the minimum number of trade union members required by Panamanian legislation should be lowered, Act No.  raised the number to  in the public sector.
.Furthermore, FENASEP alleges that, on  October , the current Minister of Labour dismissed the General Secretary of the Association of Employees of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (ASEMITRABS) Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz (a labour inspector enjoying protection under the Conventions on labour inspection ratified by Panama), who is protected by section  of Act No. , which states that  the following public servants (even if they are not in the administrative service) can only be dismissed for the reasons established in this act: . The General Secretary of any association or federation of public servants, from the time of his selection until three months after the conclusion of the term of office for which he was elected ...' 
.Moreover, given that brother Castillo is a labour inspector, as stated in Staff Decree No. , the Minister of Labour, Dr Corts, has also violated another Convention ratified by Panama in , the Labour Inspection Convention,  (No. ), in particular Article  of that Convention which states that:  The inspection staff shall be composed of public servants whose status and conditions of service are such that they are assured of stability of employment and are independent of changes of government and of improper external influences.' The rights (enshrined in ILO Convention No. ) of brother Castillo and other inspectors who have been dismissed by the current government, as well as those of others who will surely be dismissed, are being violated.
.Finally, FENASEP alleges that the Minister of Labour is attempting to disregard FENASEP as a trade union organization and is currently refusing to grant it education insurance funds, leaving thousands of public servants without the necessary protection (all the private sector trade union organizations are receiving the corresponding budget appropriation).
.In its communication of  June , CONATO alleges that Act No.  of , and Act No.  of , have removed the right of public officials dismissed unfairly and then reinstated through a ruling to receive the lost wages running from the moment of separation until that of reinstatement.
.CONATO also alleges refusal to allocate  per cent of the education insurance to FENASEP. Section  of the cabinet decree of  July , establishing the education insurance, states that it is the Trade Union Education Commission that is responsible for determining the use of education insurance funds for education or trade union training. Indeed, for many years, the abovementioned Commission approved the allocation of said funds to FENASEP, taking into account the fact that FENASEP is a unique and special trade union organization which operates within the public administration and which has been a part of CONATO for approximately  years. Moreover, on various occasions, a FENASEP representative has spoken before the International Labour Conference (ILC) on behalf of the entire Panamanian trade union movement. Furthermore, the education insurance is financed by deductions (. per cent) from the salaries of all public workers. CONATO states that the Trade Union Education Commission is made up of three CONATO representatives, the Rector of the University of Panama, two technical experts on trade union education and the Minister of Labour (who presides over the Commission), with decisions being adopted by a majority. Furthermore, within this body, the Minister of Labour does not have the power to determine unilaterally how education insurance funds are allocated. The move to hold back these funds undoubtedly reflects the current Government s anti-union policy.
.Furthermore, the authorities orchestrated a libellous propaganda campaign to demonize and discredit the trade union leaders in the eyes of the public. In particular, they threatened to denounce various trade union leaders to the public ministry for alleged inconsistencies regarding the management of the  per cent of the education insurance. This anti-union campaign was undertaken despite the fact that section  of the Labour Code states that  The establishment of trade unions is in the public interest, being an effective means to contribute to the economic and social maintenance and development of the country, Panamanian popular culture and democracy' 
.The CONATO also alleges that, through Ruling No. DM / of  December , the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development (MITRADEL) implemented a manual of procedures for the Department of Social Organizations, with the aim of imposing these new rules on trade unions, federations, confederations and central workers' organizations when they present documents concerning the functioning of trade unions. These rules consist of supervising and vouching for the electoral process of trade union organizations and associations; intervening ex officio or at the request of the parties to the disputes between trade union organizations or associations or within them and resolving them in accordance with the law. Furthermore, in cases in which trade unions are carrying out changes to their executive, prior to its establishment, any new executive must be approved by MITRADEL. This ruling attempts to overturn or repeal provisions of the ILO Conventions, the Political Constitution and the",1,2009,Panama
46,"Labour Code which concern the right to elect trade union representatives freely and which limit the competence of the Ministry of Labour to the registration of the electoral process. The abovementioned ruling endangers the exercise of trade union rights.
.The CONATO adds that the authorities of the Ministry of Labour have frozen  requests for the trade union registration over the last ten months, that is to say, they are trying to avoid applying the Labour Code.
.Furthermore, section  of Act No.  of  June  allows enterprises to operate for the first six years without undertaking bargaining processes concerning collective labour agreements. Moreover, section  of this Act fails to take into consideration the representation of social organizations of workers and employers, that is to say, the National Private Enterprise Council (CONEP) and CONATO, with regards the composition of the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar.
.Finally, CONATO alleges that Act No.  of  frees employers from the duty of deducting trade union dues and transferring them to the trade union, this change having a major economic impact on trade unions. Moreover, the abovementioned act amends the Labour Code, restricting the workers' right to strike and to have disputes resolved through arbitration.
.Act No.  of  also establishes that workers' confederations, centrals and trade union federations not affiliated to any confederation or central shall be grouped together under the Workers' Council of Panama (COTRAPA), with CONATO (the highest Panamanian workers' body) being abolished. Formerly, it was CONATO which submitted short lists to the executive body for the nomination of the workers' representatives to the ILC and the official Panamanian bodies. Now, these short lists will be submitted by COTRAPA, the workers' confederations and centrals and the trade union federations so that the Government can manipulate the appointment of the workers' representatives. Act No.  makes the situation worse by establishing that COTRAPA will be made up of a representative of CONATO, a representative of the Independent National Confederation of Labour Union Unity (CONUSI), a representative of each trade union confederation, a representative of each workers' central and a representative of each workers' federation.
.Finally, CONATO refers to other violations of the labour rights of the workers not related to the ILO Conventions on freedom of association.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the allegations made by FENASEP in its complaint refer to a series of situations that this organization perceives as being violations of trade union rights, as well as to FENASEP and ASEMITRABS, the latter body being completely unknown to the majority of the public servants working at the Ministry of Labour. Consequently, there is a need to exhaustively examine the internal legislation, given that the public administration is built on a basis for management and rules which are distinct from those governing private enterprises. The latter are fundamentally covered by the provisions of the Labour Code, which defines the concept of trade union and how such bodies are granted legal personality, the situation regarding the public administration being very different.
.As to the amendment of Act No.  of , and Act No.  of , structuring administrative and legislative careers respectively, the Government states that it considered it appropriate to reformulate the provisions of said Act, given that Act No.  of  June  distorts the spirit of entry into the administrative service, which should be one of merit and competition. The Act of  clearly deviates from the main objective of the administrative service career path by stating that acting public servants will only be evaluated if they can prove that they meet the minimum requirements for entry into the service and will not be required to take part in administrative service open competitions.
.As to the legal minimum number of members of a trade union organization stated by FENASEP and established under Act No.  of  (Administrative Careers Act), the Government states that, originally, the number was . In , without any prior study being carried out, the minimum number of members required to form an organization of public servants was amended to . The only effect the new amendment of  has is to re-establish  as the minimum number of members required to form an organization of public servants. It is important to highlight this fact given that the Administrative Careers Act neither refers to nor governs trade union organizations, as pointed out by FENASEP in its complaint.
.Furthermore, FENASEP affirms that Act No.  of  July  eliminates the tripartism, advocated by the ILO, by preventing FENASEP from participating in the Executive Committee and the Appeal and Conciliation Committee of the Administrative Service. It should be pointed out, in this regard, that the participation of public servants, as well as of the Government and the users, in said bodies is enshrined in the provisions of said act.
.The Government refers to the allegation that Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz is protected by section  of Act No.  of , given that he holds the post of Secretary General of ASEMITRABS. In this regard, the Government states that the abovementioned employees' association is not currently operating within MITRADEL. The officials know nothing about ASEMITRABS or the activities of any such organization of public servants. In reality, said association does not operate within the institution. Furthermore, Mr Daz has lodged an administrative appeal of full jurisdiction with the Third Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. Consequently, the Panamanian State must not issue an opinion in this regard because the case is currently being examined by the internal judicial authority which will decide on the legal merit of the claim.
.FENASEP calls itself a trade union organization and states that it is being denied education insurance funds, with thousands of public servants being left without the necessary protection, given that all the trade unions in the private sector have received the corresponding budget appropriation. In this regard, the Government states that, under Panamanian positive law, the legislation is clear with regards the difference between a trade union and an association of public servants. The following is an example which demonstrates that point. There was an attempt to establish a trade union at the University of Panama, referred to as an enterprise workers' trade union. This registration of a trade union, made up of public servants working at the University of Panama, was presented as that of an enterprise trade union. However, the law does not permit the establishment of this type of organization for several reasons: () it is not composed of  workers' as defined according to the provisions of section  of the Labour Code; () the persons applying to register an enterprise trade union are employed at the University of Panama, an entity which, in accordance with article  of the Political Constitution, is an Official University of the State with autonomous status. Hence, all persons employed there are public servants, as defined by article  of the Constitution:  Public servants are persons who are temporarily or permanently appointed to posts in the executive, legislature or judiciary, municipalities, or autonomous or semi-autonomous entities; and in general persons who are remunerated by the State'  () this trade union calls itself an enterprise trade union and it is therefore necessary to clarify this term in accordance with section  of the Labour Code which states  For the purpose of labour standards, enterprise means the structure encompassing activities and means which constitute an economic unit for the extraction, production or distribution of goods or services for profit or otherwise'  Clearly, in view of the provisions of the Constitution, the University of Panama does not meet this definition. It is important, therefore, to point out that registration of a trade union composed of public servants of the University of Panama is not feasible, since this violates clear, specific standards of the Labour Code.
.The Government highlights that section  of the Labour Code governs the relationship between capital and labour, i.e. it refers to the employment relationship between a private investor and an employee. Such a private investor, as opposed to a public or official investor, has the legal title of  employer' and is defined as  the natural or legal person for whom the worker provides services or performs work' (section  of the Labour Code). An employee, as opposed to a public servant, is given the title of  worker' and is defined by law as the natural person who has the obligation  by means of a verbal or written employment contract, explicit or presumed, individually or as part of a group, to provide a service or perform a task while subordinate to or dependent on a person' (section ). The Labour Code does not govern employment relationships between public servants and state/public institutions, as provided for in section :  Public employees shall be governed by the administrative career regulations, except where specific provision is made for the application",-1,2009,Panama
47,"of any rules of the present Code'  Article  of the Constitution states that public servants are persons appointed within, inter alia, autonomous or semi-autonomous entities, and in general those who receive remuneration from the State; therefore, it is not the provisions of the Labour Code but the administrative career regulations which are applicable, as laid down by section  of the Code, and therefore it is not possible to claim treatment and benefits, such as the education insurance appropriation, equal to those enjoyed by trade unions if associations of public servants are not covered by those benefits.
.In its communication of  December , the Government transmits a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice, of  February , recognizing the right of public servants to receive the lost wages and other benefits for the period between the date of their unfair dismissal and their reinstatement. Regarding this last point, in its communication of  November , the Government states that the complainants state that in the world of work (both private and public), as a general rule, any worker who has been unfairly dismissed and then reinstated through a ruling, has the right to receive the lost wages for the period between the moment of separation and reinstatement. Furthermore, according to the complainants, as a result of Act No.  of  July , public servants have had this right taken away from them. The Government states that this claim is groundless, given that Act No.  of  does not contain any provision for the removal of such a right. This is demonstrated by the cases of the officials of MITRADEL, who were dismissed and consequently brought successful legal actions which resulted in the State having to pay the employment benefits resulting from the actions.
.As to the alleged disregard for FENASEP as a trade union organization, the Government states that in the complaint it is claimed that the authorities disregard Articles  and  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). However, Artitcle  determines the meaning of the term  organization'  and therefore the authorities cannot be held to have disregarded anything because the article merely refers to the meaning of a term. Article  determines the obligation of those Members of the International Labour Organization (ILO) whose ratifications have been registered with the Director-General.
.With regards this last point, the Government highlights that it responded to the appeal made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Standards Committee of the ILC of the ILO, setting out the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association concerning Case No. , and the proposals that the Office wishes to implement. Among other things, a formal request was made to the ILO for technical assistance from the Office in addressing issues concerning freedom of association, in order to seek formulas of compromise making it possible to harmonize national legislation and practice with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and .
.It should be reiterated that under Panamanian law there exists a clear and defined difference between a trade union organization and an association of public servants. The Labour Code does not govern employment relations between public servants and government or public institutions, in accordance with the final paragraph of section , which states that:  Public employees shall be governed by the administrative career regulations, except where specific provision is made for the application of any rules of the present Code' 
.The Political Constitution of the Republic determines that  Public servants are persons who are temporarily or permanently appointed to posts in the executive, legislature or judiciary, municipalities, or autonomous or semi-autonomous entities; and in general persons who are remunerated by the State' 
.Furthermore, for FENASEP to be considered as a trade union organization, the Political Constitution would have to be amended, which would be no easy task according to article , Title XIII of the Constitution on  Reform of the Constitution'  which states that:The National Assembly, Cabinet Council and the Supreme Court of Justice all have the power to propose constitutional reforms. Said reforms must be approved through one of the following procedures:
.As to the allegation regarding the refusal to grant  per cent of the education insurance to FENASEP, the Government states that FENASEP is a representative association of the public sector workers of Panama, with legal personality granted by the executive body through Ruling No.  of  September , and is therefore governed by Title VIII, chapter I, section , and the following articles of Act No.  of  June   establishing and regulating administrative careers' 
.Section  of the same Act states that  Associations of public servants shall be recognized by the executive body through the Ministry of Government and Justice, with the opinion of the General Directorate of Administrative Careers through a reasoned ruling and subject to compliance with the requirements established by law'  Section  goes on to state  Associations shall be granted legal personality once they have been registered in the Associations of Public Workers Section of the public registry, and shall enjoy the same rights and be governed by the same limitations as any other not-for-profit association' 
.The above information is fundamental in determining whether FENASEP has the right to receive education insurance funds for trade union education under Act No. , section (), of  July .
.This act states that the  per cent appropriation shall be used for  trade union education'  that is to say, by trade union organizations recognized by the executive body and whose legal personality shall be determined by registration with MITRADEL. FENASEP does not fall into this category, because, although it was granted recognition and consequent legal personality by the executive body, this was done through the Ministry of Government on the understanding that FENASEP was a not-for-profit association, and in no way a trade union, as if it were, its legal personality would be registered with MITRADEL.
.The Government opines that the way in which FENASEP was granted its legal identity and the purposes for which it was established cannot be disregarded. While the purposes of FENASEP seem to coincide with those of a trade union organization and with participation in CONATO, the federation does not fall into this category. Therefore, the idea that FENASEP should receive financial support is questionable, given that only trade unions are entitled to such funding.
.FENASEP cannot claim to have been established under Act No.  of  June  and then use other provisions of Panamanian positive law to claim benefits to which, in the view of the Government, it is not legally entitled. Had financial support been granted, then this would mean that MITRADEL had committed an act of corruption and diversion of public funds, which would obviously be illegal.
.As to the allegation that the Government has dismissed trade union leaders within the Ministry of Labour, disregarding the grounds mentioned in Act No.  of , the Government states that no employees' associations operate within MITRADEL, and therefore, no trade union leaders have been dismissed.
.As to the alleged campaign aimed at discrediting the trade union leaders, the Government states that it is clear that the complainants have made a series of fictitious statements. The complainants refer to a report issued by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, dated  May , examining the way in which trade unions spend public money (such as the education insurance), the use of which must be supervised by the State owing to its provenance. This report identified serious administrative irregularities and the diversion of funds by some trade unions, as a result of which the State was clearly obliged to send the findings of the report to the Public Ministry, so that the latter could, subject to compliance with the law, identify those responsible, should they exist. In a State governed by the rule of law, these principles apply to all citizens residing in the Republic of Panama, with no exception being made for members of a trade union, and therefore no articles of Convention No.  have been violated, nor has the freedom of association been infringed in any way.
.As to the allegations regarding the manual of procedures for the Department of Social Organizations, established under ministerial Ruling No. DM / of  December , the Government states that this instrument is used by the Department of Social Organizations of MITRADEL. The manual covers the mechanism and requirements that must be respected with regards applications or procedures within said department. It in no way limits the freedom of association, on the contrary, it reiterates, for the benefit of trade union organizations, the formalities with which they sometimes fail to comply (thus impeding the effective and timely management of procedures). The manual also gives details of and expands on the legal framework, in keeping with the Constitution and the Labour Code, allowing",-1,2009,Panama
48,"officials to be proactive and to manage trade union structures in due form (assemblies, vote counting, leave to attend seminars, reform of statutes, etc.). The Department of Social Organizations does not, however, interfere with regards changes to executive committees, nor issues involving trade union immunity. Rather, those changes are transmitted to the department so that the database can be updated and the information certified should such an assurance be sought by interested parties. The Government attaches a copy of the manual of procedures, published in the Official Journal No.  of  January .
.As to the alleged freezing of  requests for trade union registration over the last ten months, thus avoiding implementation of the Labour Code and infringing provisions of Conventions Nos  and , the Government states that, once the appropriate inquiries were carried out before the Department of Social Organizations, nine legal personalities were granted under the current administration, far exceeding the number granted under any previous administration. The Government highlights that section  of the Labour Code establishes that:Once the  calendar days referred to under articles  and  have expired, should the request for registration not have been rejected or objected to, the trade union, federation, confederation or workers' central organization shall be considered to be registered for all legal purposes and, consequently, the Ministry is obliged to issue the respective documents and certifications and to add the corresponding entry to the registry of social organizations.
.The Government goes on to state that, under the above provision, once the period established has expired, should the request for registration not have been rejected or objected to, the trade union, federation, confederation or workers' central organization shall be considered to be registered. Thus, it would be impossible to freeze  requests for trade union registration, given that under the law, they would have to have been registered and the corresponding certifications issued. The Government clarifies, however, that it would be impossible to grant legal personalities outside the framework of the law, that is to say, to bodies which fail to comply with the requirements established under the Act through actions such as: the presentation of a provisional list of members, failure to provide personal identity cards, errors of form (and sometimes of substance) concerning statutes, as well as the founding instrument or its clauses, among other causes or omissions leading to refusal of registration.
.As to Act No.  of  June , establishing a special regime for the area of Bar, the Government states that for several decades now Puerto Armuelles and the district of Bar, in particular, have suffered from social, cultural, economic and health problems, owing to the failure of previous administrations to implement sustainable policies, an issue that the Government is addressing in a responsible manner. Assessments were carried out across the region, in order to identify possible opportunities for development. It was concluded that there was a need to establish an appropriate mechanism for attracting economic investment to the district in the form of a special economic area. The project took the form of a suitable integral development plan, based on the establishment of a special integral regime for the establishment and operation of enterprises, manufacturing industries and any economic activity that will contribute to the national and global economy through the export of goods and services, promoting investment and encouraging scientific, technological, economic, cultural, educational, health and social development in the country.
.The labour legislation was drawn up with employment promotion in mind, guaranteeing a / business environment through changes in terms of varying shifts and rest days (not necessarily Sundays). MITRADEL set up the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar, which carried out large-scale consultations, dialogues and presentations aimed at the workers of the area, who, in turn, expressed their support for the project.
.As to the allegations relating to Act No.  of , the Government states that it concluded the National Tripartite Dialogue Forum with sectors of civil society, which met for over three months of intense debate over Act No. . Tripartite agreements were signed under which it was agreed that Act No.  would be split into six bills, to be approved at a future date by the legislative body.
.Act No.  was repealed in October  in the framework of a national tripartite dialogue which led to the approval of various acts by the National Assembly, including an act containing labour reforms (all of which were duly agreed on at the Tripartite Dialogue Forum). The arguments of the complainants were rendered groundless by the repeal of Act No. .
.Finally, the Government reiterates that it respects the Conventions on the freedom of association and collective bargaining that it has ratified. It is for this reason that it has been making every effort to ensure their implementation within a framework of dialogue with the social actors. Therefore, the current labour administration, taking into account the reality of the current situation and in order to comply with Conventions Nos  and  on freedom of association and to promote the social dialogue, has been examining the possibility of establishing a higher labour council as the consultative tripartite body of the executive body, attached to MITRADEL, with the aim of regulating dialogue and promoting economic and social cooperation between the public authorities and the employers' and workers' organizations of the country with regards labour issues, with the technical support of the ILO.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege recent legal reforms and rulings restricting fundamental trade union rights, refusal to recognize the public servants' organization FENASEP in practice, the exclusion of FENASEP from tripartite bodies, refusal to grant FENASEP educational insurance funds for trade union training, the freezing of the recognition of  trade union organizations and the dismissal of a trade union leader.
.As to the allegations regarding restrictions on trade union rights contained in Act No.  of , concerning the right to strike, the deduction of union fees through a check-off facility, the possibility of recourse to arbitration and the establishment, in the light of this Act (or law), of COTRAPA in order to suppress CONATO, the Committee takes due note of the Government s statements concerning the repeal of Act No.  in October of , within the framework of a national tripartite dialogue which led to the approval by the National Assembly of various acts containing reforms which had been duly agreed on.
.As to the allegations regarding Act No.  of  June , establishing a special regime for the area of Bar, which includes a provision allowing enterprises to operate for the first six years without undertaking bargaining processes concerning collective labour agreements (section  of the Act) and that the employers' central CONEP and the workers' central CONATO are not represented on the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar, the Committee notes that the Government states that the aim of the Act is to address important social, economic and cultural issues while attracting economic investment and promoting employment. According to the Government, the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development established the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar, which has carried out consultations, dialogues and presentations aimed at the workers of the area, who, in turn, have expressed their support for the project.
.The Committee wishes to point out that the right to collective bargaining is a fundamental right of the workers and their organizations and that Convention No.  only allows exceptions to the right to collective bargaining with regards officials engaged in the administration of the State, the armed forces or the police. Consequently, the Committee considers that section  of Act No.  constitutes a direct violation of Convention No.  and therefore urges the Government to take the necessary measures to repeal said provision without delay. Furthermore, noting that the Government has not responded to the complainants' allegation that the representatives of the country s workers' and employers' centrals are not represented on the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar, the Committee, recalling the importance of consultation with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations with regards labour issues, requests the Government to consider, together with those organizations, the possibility of the latter being represented on the Administration Committee, in order that they might be consulted on issues affecting their members, and to keep it informed in this regard.
.As to the allegations regarding a manual of procedures for the Department of Social Organizations (ministerial ruling of  December ), which according to the complainants restricts the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that said Manual does not limit freedom of association and that it is in keeping with the Constitution and the Labour Code. The Committee observes that the complainant organizations highlight in particular the fact that the Manual requires that the rules governing executives must be  approved' by the Ministry of Labour and allows this Ministry to",1,2009,Panama
49,"intervene ex officio in disputes between trade union organizations, as well as to supervise trade union electoral processes. The Committee observes that the text of the Manual (copy provided by the Government) does not seem to have been subject to consultations with the most representative trade union organizations. Rather, it is claimed that the Manual consists of a series of flexible procedures aimed at speeding up the administrative process and the Government is ready to consider any recommendations that might arise from its application. The Committee considers that certain terms employed in the Manual, such as the  approval' of executive committees, may give rise to problems of interpretation and requests the Government to examine said Manual with the most representative workers' organizations in order to clear up any misunderstandings and produce a text which enjoys as much support as possible.
.As to the alleged increase of the minimum number of public servants required to establish a trade union association in the public sector ( servants), in the light of Act No. , the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that: () the number of public servants required stood at  in  (Act No. ); () without any prior study being carried out, the minimum number of members required to form an organization of public servants was amended to ; and () the new amendment of  (Act No. ) re-established  as the minimum number of members required to form an organization of public servants. In this regard the Committee wishes to highlight the principle that  The requirements prescribed by law for the establishment of a trade union should not be applied in such a manner as to delay or prevent the establishment of trade union organizations. Any delay caused by the authorities in registering a trade union constitutes an infringement of Article  of Convention No. .' Furthermore, the Committee refers to the article concerning the principle it established regarding enterprise trade unions, which states that  The establishment of a trade union may be considerably hindered, or even rendered impossible, when legislation fixes the minimum number of members of a trade union at obviously too high a figure, as is the case, for example, where legislation requires that a union must have at least  founder members.' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ].
.The Committee also recalls that the Committee of Experts had considered the requirement of  public servants for the establishment of a trade union association in Panama to be excessive and had requested the Government to reduce that figure. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend Act No.  in order to reduce the minimum number of public servants necessary to establish a trade union association, given that an excessively high minimum number could restrict trade union rights, in particular in certain public institutions and small municipalities.
.As to the allegation that, in the light of Act No.  of , public servants dismissed unfairly and then reinstated through a ruling do not have the right to receive the lost wages for the period between the moment of separation and that of reinstatement, the Committee notes the Government s statement that this allegation is groundless and notes that the Government backs up this claim by referring to two Supreme Court rulings obliging the State to pay the wages and other benefits. The Committee notes that the Government only sent one of the rulings, dated  February , when, in fact, Act No.  was adopted in . The Committee would therefore be grateful if the Government would send other rulings supporting its statement.
.As to the allegations regarding the organization of public servants FENASEP i.e. refusal by the authorities to recognize FENASEP in practice, despite the fact that FENASEP representatives have participated in the ILC as delegates on several occasions, exclusion of representatives of this organization from the Technical Committee and the Appeal and Conciliation Committee in the light of Act No.  of  July , denial of education insurance funds (trade union training) previously enjoyed by FENASEP ' affecting, in particular, all those public servants from whose salaries . per cent is deducted for the education insurance (thus discriminating between trade union associations of public servants and private sector trade unions), the Committee notes the Government s statements that: () FENASEP is an association of public servants who are remunerated by the State, with legal personality granted by the Ministry of Government, governed by the Administrative Careers Act as a not-for-profit association, and not a trade union governed by the Labour Code and registered with the Ministry of Labour; () therefore it is not possible to claim treatment and benefits, such as the education insurance appropriation, equal to those enjoyed by trade unions if associations of public servants are not covered by those benefits; and () Act No.  of  July  ensures the participation of public servants and the Government in the Expert Committee and the Appeal and Conciliation Committee of the Administrative Career Service. According to the Government, the Constitution would have to be amended for FENASEP to be considered as a trade union organization. The Government recognizes, however, that FENASEP participates in CONATO and was established for purposes which seem to coincide with those of a trade union organization. The Committee also recalls that, under the law, FENASEP enjoys the right to conclude collective agreements.
.The Committee wishes to highlight that associations of public servants, whether they call themselves trade unions or not, must enjoy all the rights and guarantees contained in Convention No. , which only allows the armed forces and the police to be excluded from enjoying such rights and guarantees. The Committee wishes to emphasize that the public servants' organization FENASEP (whose representatives have participated in the ILC on several occasions and which is considered by the Government to be a representative association) recently had its right to enjoy education insurance funds for trade union training withdrawn despite the fact that public servants contribute . per cent of their salaries to said fund. Moreover, FENASEP has been excluded from the Expert Committee and the Appeals and Conciliation Committee of the Administrative Career. The Committee believes that the arguments for these exclusions advanced by the Government do not justify such treatment and requests the Government to initiate a constructive dialogue with FENASEP in order to find a solution to the problems which will avoid any risk of discrimination against the organization while allowing it to be recognized for all purposes in connection with its representativeness.
.As to the allegation that the Ministry of Labour has frozen  requests for trade union registration over the past ten months, the Committee notes that the Government states that the current administration has granted nine new legal personalities to trade union organizations (far exceeding the number granted under any previous administration), recalling that in cases of administrative silence trade union organizations having applied for registration should be considered to be registered. The Committee also notes that the Government states that legal personality cannot be granted unless the legal requirements have been fulfilled (submission of the list of members, presentation of identity cards, failure to provide founding act or the clauses of the statutes). The Committee requests the Government to indicate those trade unions which have not been registered despite the fact that they have submitted applications for registration and to communicate the reasoned administrative rulings behind the non-registration of trade union organizations.
.As to the dismissal of Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz (according to the allegations, the General Secretary of the Association of Employees of ASEMITRABS) in violation of Act No.  on the protection of trade union leaders (trade union immunity), the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () this association is completely unknown to the majority of public servants working within the Ministry of Labour and no employees' associations currently operate within the Ministry; () Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz lodged a judicial complaint before the Third Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, which will rule on the legal merit of the claim. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the result of the appeal lodged against the dismissal of Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz and, given that the Government disputes his appointment as General Secretary and even the existence of his association of public employees (despite the fact that the complainant organizations have sent a public instrument drawn up by a solicitor which vouches for ASEMITRABS' establishment and executive committee), to indicate whether said association has applied for registration and legal personality and, should that be the case, to indicate the reasons why that application was unsuccessful.
.As to the alleged campaign to discredit the trade union leaders in the eyes of the public, in particular involving threats to denounce various trade union leaders to the Public Ministry for alleged inconsistencies in the management of",1,2009,Panama
50,"the  per cent of the education insurance, the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () the allegations are a series of fictitious statements; () the Comptroller General of the Republic issued a report on  May  examining the way in which trade unions spend public funds (such as the education insurance). This report identified serious administrative irregularities and the diversion of funds by some trade unions, as a result of which the State was clearly obliged to send the findings of the report to the Public Ministry, so that the latter could, subject to compliance with the law, identify those responsible, should they exist. The Committee requests the Government to send it copies of any rulings or charges brought by the Public Ministry against trade union leaders for illicit diversion of public funds.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has been examining the possibility of establishing a higher labour council as a consultative body in order to promote social dialogue concerning labour issues with the technical support of the ILO, and that it has formally requested ILO technical assistance in harmonizing national legislation and practice with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  (the Government highlights that request in the part of this document regarding the allegations affecting FENASEP). The Committee expresses the firm hope that said technical assistance will be established in the very near future.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As to the allegations regarding Act No.  of  June , establishing a special regime for the area of Bar, which includes a provision allowing enterprises to operate for the first six years without undertaking bargaining processes concerning collective labour agreements (section  of the Act), the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to repeal the abovementioned section  without delay. Furthermore, noting that the Government has not responded to the allegation made by the complainants with regards to said Act, according to which, the representatives of the workers' central CONATO and the employers' central CONEP are not represented on the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar, the Committee recalls the importance of consultation with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations with regards labour issues, requests the Government to consider, together with those organizations, the possibility of the latter being represented on the Administration Committee, in order that they might be consulted on issues affecting their members, and to keep it informed in this regard.(b) As to the allegations regarding a Manual of Procedures for the Department of Social Organizations (ministerial ruling of  December ), which according to the complainants restricts the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee notes that the text of the Manual (copy provided by the Government) does not seem to have been subject to consultations with the most representative trade union organizations. Rather, it is claimed that the Manual consists of a series of flexible procedures aimed at speeding up the administrative process and the Government is ready to consider any recommendations that might arise from its application. The Committee finds that certain terms employed in the Manual, such as the  approval' of executive committees, may give rise to problems of interpretation and requests the Government to examine said Manual with the most representative workers' organizations in order to clear up any misunderstandings and produce a text which enjoys as much support as possible.(c) As to the alleged increase of the minimum number of public servants needed to establish a trade union association in the public sector ( servants) in the light of Act No. , the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend Act No.  in order to reduce the minimum number of public servants necessary to establish a trade union association, given that an excessively high minimum number could restrict trade union rights, in particular in certain public institutions and small municipalities.

The Committee expresses the firm hope that said technical assistance will be established in the very near future.",1,2009,Panama
51,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee once again deplores the murders, injuries and other acts of violence between  and  against trade union members and, in certain cases, against police officers. The Committee requests the Government to send the rulings issued and any future rulings in order to ensure that the facts have been clarified and that the guilty parties have been severely punished. The Committee requests the Government to convoke a tripartite dialogue with workers' and employers' organizations in the construction sector in order to examine the problems mentioned and to take all measures necessary to avoid a repeat of the acts of violence. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to communicate: () the rulings issued in relation to the alleged murder of the trade union officials Mr Luiyi Argelles and Mr Al Iromi Smith; () the rulings in relation to the injuries suffered by the trade union officials Mr David Nio and Mr Eustaquio Mndez on  August .(c) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether any judicial proceedings have been initiated against the trade union leader Mr Raymundo Garcs and, if this is the case, to communicate the ruling.(d) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the workers Mr Donaldo Pinilla and Mr Flix de Len have filed criminal charges.(e) The Committee once again requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged arrest and imposition of fines on more than  workers in the context of the demonstration of  February .(f) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the workers who were arrested and fined for the events that took place during the demonstration of  March  (all of whom were released) initiated judicial proceedings and, if this is the case, to communicate the outcome.(g) The Committee invites the Government to submit the law concerning the use of criminal records for labour-related purposes (sentences handed down for crimes) to a tripartite dialogue, particularly to ensure that criminal records acquired because of peaceful union activities do not have a bearing on obtaining employment.(h) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether judicial proceedings have been initiated by the workers concerned and, if so, to indicate their outcome.(i) The Committee calls the Governing Body s special attention to the extreme seriousness and urgency of the issues in this case.
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that the Special Committee for the Rapid Handling of Complaints concerning Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining (the Complaints Committee), established under the  Panama Tripartite Agreement, is an excellent tool for achieving tripartite dialogue in the construction sector in order to examine the issues raised and avoid a recurrence of violence. Following an ILO technical assistance mission, conducted in February , the Committee was informed of the various agreements reached during meetings of the Complaints Committee and of its timetable of activities for , which includes a monthly meeting to discuss and resolve initial and follow-up complaints presented to the Committee on Freedom of Association. In this context, the Committee encourages the Government, together with the workers' and employers' organizations in the construction sector, to consider meeting within the framework of the Complaints Committee to examine jointly the issues raised and reach agreements that will avoid recurrence of the violence in that sector. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that it will consider convening a dialogue on Act No.  of  April , on the use of criminal records for labour-related purposes, within the framework of the Tripartite Agreement Committee in order to ensure, in particular, that criminal records acquired because of peaceful trade union activities do not have a bearing on obtaining employment. The Committee requests the Government to report on the discussion of the aforementioned Act at the meetings of the Tripartite Agreement Committee.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s report (based on information provided by the Supreme Court) on the murders of Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo, Mr Luiyi Argelles and Mr Al Iromi Smith. With regard to Mr Oswaldo Lorenzo, the Government states that in Judgment No. -PI of  March , the Second High Court of Panama City sentenced Mr Jorge Morgan Melchor and Mr Miguel ngel Ibarra to  years' imprisonment and Mr Rogelio Ramos Camargo to  years' imprisonment. As regards Mr Luiyi Argelles, the Government reports that the oral hearing (trial by jury) was held on  February ; the jury acquitted the defendants and the case was therefore closed. As regards the murder of Mr Al Iromi Smith, the Government reports that the trial was transferred to the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court on  July  and the oral hearing has yet to be held. The Committee recalls that in its previous examination of the case, it took note of the sentences handed down in connection with the murder of Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo and requested the Government to confirm whether these sentences were final or whether they could be appealed before the Supreme Court of Justice. Observing that the legal proceedings in connection with the murder of the trade union leader Mr Luiyi Argelles have concluded and that the case has been closed, the Committee regrets the need to express particular concern at the failure to shed light on the facts and on the circumstances of the murder. The Committee recalls that the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to send it copies of the sentences handed down in the cases concerning the murder of Mr Argelles and of Mr Al Iromi Smith, respectively.
.With regard to the arrest of some  workers who took part in a demonstration on  February  to protest the death of the trade union leader, Mr Al Iromi Smith (where the workers were detained at national police stations and released upon payment of a fine), the Committee takes note of the police report of  May , submitted by the Government, which states that the police responded with conventional weapons to acts of public disorder and arrested the workers who had committed those acts and acted violently using firearms.
.As regards the allegations relating to the injuries suffered by the trade union leaders, Mr David Nio and Mr Eustaquio Mndez, on  August , the Government reports that neither has initiated legal proceedings for bodily harm and that both are in good health. Bearing this information in mind, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.The Government further adds that, although it has requested information from the Public Prosecution Service, it has yet to receive any information indicating whether: (i) Mr Donaldo Pinilla and Mr Flix De Len have filed a criminal complaint in connection with the alleged injuries suffered at the hands of the police during the demonstration held on  February ; (ii) criminal proceedings have been initiated against the trade union leader, Mr Raymundo Garcs (arrested in connection with a violent demonstration held in ); (iii) the workers who were arrested and fined in connection with the demonstration held on  March  (who were released) filed appeals; and (iv) the workers dismissed in  have initiated legal proceedings. The Committee regrets that to date, the Government has been unable to provide information on events that took place almost a decade ago and requests the Government to gather the relevant information as soon as possible and to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee also invites the complainants to provide information on these matters.
.The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention once again to the serious and urgent nature of this case.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report of the Committee, paras '  , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )].
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  and  November , and  February and  October .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) .
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee firmly expects that the ongoing investigations into the murders of Mr Luiyi Argelles and Mr Al Iromi Smith will be concluded without delay and that those responsible for the events in question will consequently",-1,2009,Panama
52,"be punished and requests the Government to inform it of any rulings issued.(b)	The Committee urges the Government without delay to send its observations regarding the following allegations: () the injuries suffered by trade union officials Mr David Nio, a member of the SUNTRACS executive committee, and the secretary for finances of CONUSI, Mr Eustaquio Mndez, on  August ; () the detention of SUNTRACS press and communications secretary, Mr Raimundo Garcs; () the incident in which police officers attacked workers Messrs Donaldo Pinilla and Flix de Len using firearms on  February  while they were taking part in a peaceful demonstration as part of a national strike and the arrest of and imposition of fines on over  workers who were protesting as a result of the death of the trade union official Mr Al Iromi Smith; () the violent repression and arrest by the police of  workers (including  members of SUNTRACS) participating in a demonstration on  March  and the imposition of fines on the abovementioned workers; and () the submission by the Government of a bill establishing that job applicants must provide their  police records' (proving that they do not have a criminal record) prior to obtaining employment, which, in the view of the complainants, is an attempt to punish those having participated in the demonstrations.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to take promptly the necessary measures to carry out an investigation without delay regarding the allegations concerning the dismissal of over  workers belonging to SUNTRACS owing to their refusal to join another trade union allegedly established by the enterprise ODEBRECHT and to inform the Committee of the results of this investigation and, given that the allegations date back to , to report on the current state of labour relations between the enterprises concerned and the trade unions in the construction sector.(d)	The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.
.In its communications dated  and  November , and  February and  October , the Government states that it recognizes and values the principle of freedom of association as a fundamental right of labour relations and the important role that it plays in democratic consolidation, governance and social peace. In this regard, the Government has acted in a manner befitting the rule of law, for which reason it considers the actions impugned by the complainants to be unfounded.
.The Government states that there are police intelligence reports that reveal the existence of an internal worker-union dispute, the main aim of which appeared to be the attainment of hegemony over collective agreements of large-scale building projects and their economic importance in terms of the income that the total amount of each worker s union dues represents. The participants in the inter-union dispute are the National Union of Workers of the Construction Industries (SUNTRACS) and the National Construction and Drilling Industry Workers' Union of Panama (SINTICOPP).
.SUNTRACS claims to be a consolidated and hegemonic association that strives to defend workers' rights. It states that its rivalry with SINTICOPP can be attributed to the fact that the latter is being financed by employers, for which reason it is branded a  right-wing union'  On the other hand, SINTICOPP claims that SUNTRACS promotes violence and the imposition of the will of trade union officials, who always promote radical positions influenced by extremist left-wing ideological tendencies, while, in contrast, SINTICOPP promotes the well-being of workers through dialogue and bargaining.
.Both trade unions are affiliated with confederations among which there is an amount of tension and rivalry. SUNTRACS is affiliated with the Independent National Confederation of Labour Union Unity (CONUSI) while SINTICOPP is affiliated with the National Confederation of Organized Workers (CONATO), confederations which, in the recent past, had serious disagreements involving acts of violence that resulted in public disorder. The Government adds that the information from police intelligence succeeds in linking the ideological sympathizers of SUNTRACS to the organization called the National Front for Economic and Social Rights (FRENADESO), which would appear to be the emerging platform for a future political party composed of workers with a political ideology based on the theory of social class conflict. The affiliation of the trade unions SUNTRACS and SINTICOPP with different rival worker confederations (CONUSI and CONATO respectively), added to other political and social issues championed by FRENADESO, meant that they could become a potential breeding ground for activities making use of force, which could endanger people s physical integrity.
.As a result of the police intelligence activities, which entailed obtaining, collating, streamlining and analysing specific information pertaining to the actions, threats, risks and disputes ongoing at the inter-union level, possible situations were identified that could adversely affect citizen security and the country s social collective, and that could lead to the decision to issue an alert as a cautionary and preventive measure.
.Below, the Government provides information from police sources, the Public Prosecution Service and the judicial authority relating to a significant number of acts of violence between SUNTRACS and SINTICOPP, which, according to the case, led to injuries or deaths caused by knives, blunt weapons and firearms wielded by either trade union or by the police who were set upon by the workers. According to some reports, the trade union members involved have tried to attribute their crimes to the police. The information provided by the Government contains, among other things, the details of the death of Mr Luiyi Argelles and Mr Al Iromi Smith, the injuries suffered by Mr David Nio and the detention of Mr Raimundo Garcs (in the complaint, Reinaldo) and Mr Donaldo Pinilla.
.As regards the investigation of the murder of Mr Luiyi Antonio Argelles and Mr Al Iromi Smith, the Government states that, regarding the murder of Mr Argelles (Case No. ), the Second High Court of Justice of the Province of Panama issued a ruling on  September  acquitting two police officers accused of the murder of that SUNTRACS worker (information provided by the Supreme Court of Justice in a communication dated  November ). As regards the murder of Mr Al Iromi Smith (Case No. ), the Government states that the ruling on this case (which connects a police officer) is being appealed in the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. Following this process, any developments in that regard will be communicated once the judicial body updates the relevant information. The Government states that appropriate action has been taken to move these cases forward.
.As regards the injured parties, Mr David Nio, a member of the SUNTRACS executive committee, and the secretary for finances of CONUSI, Mr Eustaquio Mndez, the Government states that, on  August , on the premises of the Panam-Coln motorway construction project, which belongs to the construction company ODEBRECHT located in the community of Chilibre, which is a district and province of Panama, the metropolitan police based in the Metro Norte jurisdiction state that, on that date, a group of people, presumably workers affiliated with SUNTRACS, arrived unannounced on the premises of the project carrying banners and flags with flagpoles made of long, blunt cylindrical objects intent on disrupting the daily tasks of the workers. According to the Government, the SUNTRACS workers were repelled by the group of workers at the construction premises, who were presumably affiliated with SINTICOPP. The aggression with which they confronted each other reached the point of physical violence and the use of blunt weapons and knives, which resulted in Mr Ronald Adamson and Mr David Nio suffering injuries including trauma and cuts, both men, who were members of SUNTRACS, were transferred to health-care facilities to receive the necessary medical attention. The Government adds that the members of the Crowd Control Unit arrived at the scene to calm the members of both trade unions, SUNTRACS and SINTICOPP, who continued to call each other communists and supporters of Chvez in the case of SINTICOPP, and right-wing sell-outs in the case of SUNTRACS.
.As regards the injured party, Mr Eustaquio Mndez, the Government states that, on  February , in various premises where construction projects for buildings in the city of Coln were being carried out, trade union members affiliated with SUNTRACS were responsible for committing acts of public disorder, notably that which took place in the area known as Los Cuatro Altos, where, from the top of the buildings, the trade union members used firearms against the public order officers belonging to the Crowd Control Unit, which forced them to respond by using the arms appropriate for this type of situation (tear gas, rubber bullets and shots). This confrontation led to the injury of a number of workers, among them Mr Eustaquio Mndez, who were transferred to the emergency department of the Dr Hugo Spadafora General Hospital of the Social Insurance Fund in the area of Coco Solo, in the town of Cristbal, in the district and province of Coln. Once the workers had been transferred to the hospital, the Lince police units were ordered via radio to go",-1,2009,Panama
53,"to the hospital to confirm what had happened and the admission of the injured thereto. Another incident took place on the hospital premises involving the two Lince police units, the SUNTRACS trade union officials and the members affiliated with the National Association of Administrative Civil Servants of the Social Insurance Fund (ANFACSS). An incident was reported in which a group of approximately  to  people, who were standing opposite the hospital premises and which included three SUNTRACS members in addition to natural persons, civil servants of the Social Insurance Fund (CSS) health institution, who were presumably militants and/or sympathizers of a trade union group known as ANFACSS and who impeded the police officers from entering the hospital by encircling them. The three SUNTRACS members, Mr Alfonso Cunningham, Mr Al Iromi Smith and Mr Eustaquio Mndez proceeded to use such extreme physical violence against the motorcycle of the two police officers and the police officers themselves that one of the officers was forced to fire his regulation weapon, shooting one of the people involved in the attack, Mr Al Iromi Smith.
.As regards the detention of Mr Raymundo Garcs, SUNTRACS press and communications secretary, the Government states that, on  August , a group of approximately  people, presumably members of SUNTRACS, arrived on the premises of a construction project for a hotel complex belonging to the company MAQTEC, by sea, from Isla San Miguel intent on arriving unannounced onto the project premises in Isla Viveros to halt the work being carried out by the workers, presumably affiliated with SINTICOPP.
.As regards this incident, the Government states that, prior to its occurrence and on the occasion of the re-examination of the events that took place between the two rival trade union groups, added to the mutual threats and warnings that only served to exacerbate the inter-union dispute, both factions mutually denounced the recruitment of persons with no part in construction activities, including foreigners, to introduce hostile forces into movements aimed at defending the interests of trade unions, claiming that they would take any measures and use any weapons necessary to defend themselves.
.The Government adds that this prompted the National Police, given the prior alert and the hostile activities that had resulted in the death of Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo (which was examined during the previous examination of the case), to implement a plan of operations in the construction project of the company MAQTEC, located on Isla Viveros in the Archipilago de las Perlas in the Pacific Ocean, in the district of Balboa, in the Province of Panama, in view of the fact that the same type of conflict existed between the same trade unions (SUNTRACS and SINTICOPP) in that project, adducing the same arguments as in the Panama-Coln motorway project, and of the fact that they accused each other of using persons with no part in the labour movements for the purposes of intimidation and assassination.
.The National Police mobilized a contingent composed of Crowd Control Units (public order) and Special Forces (threat of assassination), located on Isla Viveros on the premises of the construction project of the company MAQTEC.
.Early on the morning of  August , the group of police officers guarding the control dock of the National Police on Isla Viveros were informed that the SUNTRACS workers were on their way to the island, which prompted the units to respond. This prompted a group of police officers to be swiftly and urgently deployed to intercept them as they made their way to the project site.
.When they were approximately , metres away from the demonstrators, they ordered them to halt their advance but the demonstrators paid them no heed. Instead, they hurled insults and threats at the project workers while making known their intention to stop their work with immediate effect, for which reason the police officers again ordered the demonstrators to stop their advance and to vacate the area. The demonstrators continued their advance until they were barely  metres away from the construction site. The police squadrons took up their positions while the workers continued their advance, hurling insults and threats, carrying banners, stones, sticks, machetes, axes, knives, shovels and spades, objects which were in plain sight and which could be seen through the binoculars of the special units of the National Police from  metres away, between the demonstrators and the police.
.The National Police once again ordered them to halt their advance. However, they only became more aggressive and threatening, for which reason, when there was approximately  metres between the demonstrators and the police, gases were released by mechanical propulsion devices and by hand. Nevertheless, the demonstrators started to rush towards the project, for which reason the use of gas and shotguns to fire warning rounds intensified.
.Subsequently, there was only a distance of '  metres between the demonstrators and the National Police, for which reason the use of gas and shotguns to fire warning rounds intensified, which expedited the demonstrators' withdrawal from the area and allowed the police to apprehend the trade union official, Mr Raymundo Ernesto Garcs Castillo, personal identification No. --, who had been participating in the demonstrations with a video camera, two mobile telephones and a balaclava on his head as a hat before the police units transferred him via boat to Isla San Miguel on the orders of magistrate Secundino Henrquez, the competent authority of the area.
.As regards the attacks involving firearms against Mr Donaldo Pinilla and Mr Flix de Len, the Government states that they took part in the aforementioned events that took place on  February  involving public disorder in various locations where construction projects for buildings in the city of Coln were being carried out, for which members affiliated with SUNTRACS were responsible and during which they did not demonstrate peacefully as they state in their complaint. In a number of cases, these workers fought against the police units from the top of buildings with firearms, which forced the police to respond by using the arms appropriate for public disorder, such as tear gas, rubber bullets and shots. These confrontations led Mr Pinilla and Mr De Len to suffer injuries and Mr Pinilla to be transferred to the emergency department at Dr Hugo Spadafora General Hospital.
.As regards the events that took place on  March , during which the complainants claim that over  construction workers were arrested, the Government states that the Director of the National Police, in his statement of  October , provides a detailed report of the events that took place, which includes the following:On  March , television channels and National Police surveillance cameras warned that the vicinity of Bella Vista, Calle , Avenida Balboa y Cinta Costera, was the scene of protests by construction workers carrying flags and insignias alluding to the National Union of Workers of the Construction and Related Industries (SUNTRACS) and blocking the free movement of vehicles and commuters in that area by burning tyres and throwing stones, bags of cement, breeze blocks and other blunt weapons from the unfinished buildings, not only at private and State property but, more seriously, this constituted an attack on the physical integrity of the commuters in that area. These protests had been ongoing since before  March  and had created an atmosphere of insecurity in the capital, which, on  March, finally erupted into violence, the closure of lanes on certain streets, the smashing of shop windows, damage to private and National Police vehicles and the injury of two police officers: Second Sergeant , Aquilino Cruz, and Officer , Reynaldo Rodrguez. These acts of violence, which exceeded the right of workers to speak out against any labour-related irregularity, became classed as criminal acts in accordance with our criminal legislation, prompting the intervention of the Crowd Control Unit and the Support Team of the National Police in order to re-establish public order, peace and security, and to protect the life, honour and property of all those involved.
.Section  of the Police Act, Act No.  of  June  specifically sets out the National Police s functions as: to safeguard the life, honour, property and other rights and freedoms of those who come under the jurisdiction of the State; to preserve internal public order; to preserve the peace and security of inhabitants, as well as to carry out any missions assigned to it by the President of the Republic, in accordance with the Constitution and the law; which it shall complete, according to the provisions of paragraphs ,  and  of the aforementioned law, by assisting and protecting persons and their property, maintaining and re-establishing public order, preventing and suppressing criminal acts and offences, as well as by pursuing and capturing law-breakers.
.In the light of these events, it was necessary to take action against the law-breakers, in strict accordance with the Constitution and law, contrary to the claims of the complainants. The National Police, despite the number of protesters apprehended, brought them before the competent authority, namely the Magistrate of Curund, in a",-1,2009,Panama
54,"timely fashion on  March . Furthermore, criminal charges for those acts were filed with the Complaints Reception Centre on the same date. It should be noted that a number of the participants in the protests were in possession of a slip stating that they had been transported or captured.
.The Government states that it is not opposed to peaceful protests because it is an established right but the SUNTRACS protests that day were in no way peaceful. In this context, the National Police intervened with control measures in order to re-establish order, which led it to apprehend  protesters. It should be noted that, of the persons apprehended in the riots orchestrated by members of SUNTRACS, four were found to have ongoing cases before the competent authority (criminal courts and official municipal representative).
.In addition to the aforementioned acts, the Magistrate of the Bella Vista Police, Mr Eduardo Palacios, in a communication dated  October , stated that, on  March , a total of  construction workers were referred to his office and that, through a resolution issued on  March , they were fined a sum of  balboas for disrupting public order. He also pointed out that the resolution in question was duly signed by the workers' legal representative.
.The Government adds that, as a consequence of the acts of violence and disruption of public order, the National Police filed criminal charges against the demonstrators (SUNTRACS workers) on  March , who were apprehended. The charges were filed for crimes against the judicial administration and the National Police and were also filed with the Assistant Prosecutor of the Republic of Panama of the Public Prosecution Service in order for the pertinent investigations to be carried out and for those involved to be sanctioned for violating the criminal legislation in force.
.In this case, the Deputy Attorney-General stated in Communication No. DPGN-- of  October , that the aforementioned charges were indeed filed with the Complaints Reception Centre of the Public Prosecution Service for the acts committed by SUNTRACS members during the demonstrations on Avenida Balboa, Calle , Cinta Costera and Calle  Bella Vista. The Communication states the following:' the charges were filed on  March  by the legal adviser of the National Police, explaining that during the five days preceding the filing of the charges, SUNTRACS workers had been participating in demonstrations;' the charges state that, on the day of the incident, video surveillance cameras showed the demonstrations turning into riots and disruption of public order, during which the demonstrators burned tyres on the public highway and threw stones and blunt weapons. These acts prompted the intervention of the Crowd Control Unit and the Support Team of the National Police to re-establish public order, peace and security, and to protect the life and property of commuters and residents where the events took place;' the charges explain that the demonstrators reacted in an inappropriate manner against the National Police, charging at uniformed officers, throwing various blunt weapons at them, obstructing the functions set out in the Police Act in order to re-establish public order, and thereby perpetrating the crime specified in section  of the Criminal Code. As a result of the aforementioned actions, which clearly disrupted public order, the National Police apprehended those involved and brought them before the administrative authorities in order for their legal situation to be assessed and resolved. The charges filed by the National Police initiated the relevant procedure, which included carrying out and incorporating into the summary all the steps that would clarify the events and attribute the crime to the perpetrators. Once the investigations mentioned in the summary had been completed and their outcome analysed, this case was referred to the First Anti-Corruption Prosecutor s Office at the Bella Vista Magistrate s Office in order for the appropriate judicial action to be taken;' similarly, in addition to the aforementioned summary, the Public Prosecution Service also launched investigations based on charges filed by private citizens and by the municipality of Panama in view of the damage caused as a result of the demonstrations and aforementioned acts. However, in none of the cases could any one person be identified as the perpetrator of or a participant in the acts, given the tumultuous manner in which they took place;' this confirms that the members of SUNTRACS were only sanctioned by the Magistrate by means of a fine for having disrupted public order. The investigations following that imposition are the result of charges filed by the National Police, the institution affected by the events that took place on the date mentioned. This disproves the facts established by SUNTRACS in its complaint to the ILO in which it states that they were being sanctioned twice on the same grounds.
.As regards SUNTRACS s allegations that this constituted a violation of human rights, constitutional guarantees and the right to freedom of association, the Government considers these rights and guarantees not to have been violated since the trade union acted contrary to the provisions governing the right to demonstrate and the right to organize, which resulted in acts of violence against the National Police, affected third parties and private property and disrupted free movement and public order in general. Consequently, this led to arrests in flagrante delicto.
.As regards the allegations that those arrested were not brought before the competent authority, these are false, since they were taken to the Ancn police station. However, given the number of demonstrators apprehended, which exceeded , and that they were too numerous to house, they were transferred to La Joya and La Joyita penitentiary centres while the investigations were being carried out and they were being referred to the competent authorities. Similarly, at no time were they incarcerated with criminals serving sentences in those penitentiary centres, rather they were placed in adjacent areas (yards and open areas) inside the centres pending the sanctions of the Magistrate to whom they had been referred. They remained in custody while the sanction was being determined by the relevant authority and were assigned a legal representative, who was responsible for paying the fines imposed upon them.
.From the above, it is clear that many of the complaints made by SUNTRACS are in fact unfounded, in view of the acts that were both violent and inconsistent with the exercise of the right to demonstrate freely and the right to freedom of association.
.The Government states that is respects all provisions of Convention No.  and seeks to comply with its requirements in order to effectively promote freedom of association in Panama, provided that this right is exercised appropriately and without breaking the law.
.As regards the allegation that the Government submitted a bill establishing that job applicants must provide their  police records' (proving that they do not have a criminal record), the Government states that the bill was approved and ratified by Act No.  of  April , which prescribes measures concerning the Personal Record Certificate, amends the Electoral Code and adds a section to the Criminal Code (which the Government has attached as an appendix to its reply). Under this law, access to information held in the Archives and Personal Information Office shall be granted to the competent authorities, the holder of the information and to natural or legal persons duly authorized by the holder for labour purposes. Contrary to the opinion of the complainants, this law does not seek to prevent demonstrations or curtail the right to organize, rather it seeks to grant access to personal records through certification by the Legal Investigation Directorate, which will contain only information held in the Archives and Personal Information Office related to prison sentences handed down for crimes recorded over the decade preceding the issuing of the certificate.
.As regards the complainants' allegations concerning the dismissal of over  workers affiliated to SUNTRACS owing to their refusal to join another trade union allegedly established by the enterprise ODEBRECHT, the Government states that, according to the company s reply contained in a communication dated  September , which was allegedly sent to the ILO in  in a timely fashion, it may be established that sometime on the morning of  August , a considerable group of SUNTRACS members (according to the complaint, more than ) arrived in hired buses, on the premises of the company ODEBRECHT in the camping resort of Chilibre in order to demonstrate against the company workers who were members of SINTICOPP, alleging that SINTICOPP belonged to the company and had been set up by it in order to sign a collective agreement. Owing to these problems and the confrontations between the SUNTRACS workers and the SINTICOPP workers, a member of SUNTRACS died, which led the Public Prosecution Service to carry out investigations condemning those involved and fining them by means of a judicial ruling. The dismissals had nothing to do with the company ODEBRECHT because the members of SUNTRACS did not work for the company and, when the confrontation on the premises of ODEBRECHT occurred, they should not",-1,2009,Panama
55,"have been demonstrating in that place.
.In reply to a request for information made by the Committee, the Government states that, currently, the company ODEBRECHT enjoys good relations with both SINTICOPP and SUNTRACS, given that for the projects they have been contracted to work on, the company signed collective agreements with both trade unions, which took place without incident, as did the signing of the collective agreements for the irrigation project Remigio Rojas in Chiriqu and the Madden-Coln motorway with SINTICOPP, and the collective agreements for the Cinta Costera project and the Dos Mares hydroelectric project with SUNTRACS.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s observations to the effect that it respects Convention No.  and points out that the context for the majority of the allegations were acts of violence between rival groups of trade union members in the construction sector between  and  (struggling to gain access to the trade union dues in the lucrative construction sector) and violent demonstrations in , and that the conduct of the police fell within the current judicial framework aimed at safeguarding citizen security and preventing public disorder and damage to property (as can be deduced from the police reports that the Government has attached as an appendix). The Committee takes note of the Government s description of the developments in the labour relations in the sector since that time, and that both trade unions have concluded collective agreements in the sector.
.The Committee deeply deplores the murders, injuries and other acts of violence against trade union members and, in certain cases, against police officers, and underlines the extreme seriousness of these events. The Committee recalls that freedom of association can only be exercised if the right to life is fully respected and that it is incompatible with a climate of violence, threats, fear or pressure, whether these emanate from State agents or representatives of professional organizations.
.The Committee recalls that it is the responsibility of the Government to guarantee the right to life and the physical integrity of all citizens and to prevent situations in which this right is threatened, and observes that the measures taken by the Government (resorting to intelligence services, the intervention of specialized security units  Crowd Control Unit'  failed to prevent loss of life or injury. The Committee underlines that trade union organizations should carry out their activities in a peaceful manner and that the intervention of the police in such activities should only occur in case of serious danger to public order and to fundamental human rights and should always be proportionate.
.The Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to guarantee the peaceful exercise of trade union activities by identifying the perpetrators of the crimes and by calling for a tripartite dialogue with workers' and employers' organizations in the construction sector in order to examine the problems mentioned and to take all measures necessary to avoid a repeat of the acts of violence.
.The Committee observes that the version of events presented by the complainants during the previous examination of the case and that presented by the Government concerning the acts of violence do not match (the complainants attribute the acts of violence to State agents and the murders to the company or a trade union controlled by the company, which the company denies) and requests the Government to send the rulings issued and any future rulings so that it can take a decision based on all of the evidence, identify those responsible for any abuse and ensure that the facts have been clarified and that the guilty parties have been severely punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it updated on these requests for information.
.The Committee notes that the judicial authority, through a ruling issued on  September , acquitted the two police officers accused of murdering the worker Mr Luiyi Argelles, who was a member of SUNTRACS, and that the ruling concerning the murder of Mr Al Iromi Smith (which convicts a police officer) is currently at the stage of appeal before the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the rulings issued in both cases.
.The Committee takes note of the injuries suffered by the trade union officials Mr David Nio (SUNTRACS) and Mr Eustaquio Mndez (CONUSI) on  August . The Committee notes the Government s assertion that, in the first case, it is a question of a violent confrontation between groups belonging to SINTICOPP and SUNTRACS and, in the second, the injuries were the result of weapons being fired from the top of a number of buildings by members of SUNTRACS, which forced the public order officers to respond by using tear gas, rubber bullets and shots. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the rulings issued in relation to these injuries.
.As regards the detention of the SUNTRACS leader, Mr Raymundo Garcs, on  August , the Committee takes note of the Government s statement to the effect that he was arrested in the context of a violent demonstration by a group belonging to SUNTRACS, which was carrying knives and blunt weapons and which refused to obey the police s order to halt their advance. Subsequently, he was brought before the competent authority of the area. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether judicial proceedings have been initiated against this official and, if this is the case, to communicate the ruling issued.
.As regards the alleged attacks on workers Messrs Donaldo Pinilla and Flix de Len by police officers using firearms on  February  while they were taking part in a peaceful demonstration as part of a national strike, and the arrest of and imposition of fines on over  workers who were protesting as a result of the death of the trade union official Mr Al Iromi Smith, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements to the effect that () Mr Donaldo Pinilla and Mr Flix de Len took part in acts of public disorder at various construction projects for buildings in the city of Coln carried out by SUNTRACS members; () in a number of cases, the workers fought the police units with firearms from the tops of buildings, which caused the police to use tear gas, rubber bullets and shots, resulting in the injury of Mr Donaldo Pinilla and Mr Flix de Len during the confrontations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it whether these workers filed a complaint because of their injuries. The Committee once again requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged arrest and imposition of fines on more than  workers in the context of the demonstration of  February .
.As regards the alleged violent repression and arrest by the police of  workers (including  members of SUNTRACS) participating in a demonstration on  March  and the imposition of fines on the abovementioned workers, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements to the effect that () the protests were not peaceful, rather they descended into criminal activity and acts of violence (the burning of tyres and throwing of stones, bags of cement and other blunt weapons from unfinished buildings), which constituted an attack on the physical integrity of the commuters in that area and on private property, obstructed the free movement of vehicles and commuters, closed lanes, caused damage to police and private vehicles and injury to two police officers; () acting within the relevant judicial framework, the police proceeded to re-establish public order, peace and security; () the police arrested the  law-breakers on  March  and brought them before the competent authority. Furthermore, charges were filed for crimes against the judicial administration and the National Police, which were referred to the Public Prosecution Service (since the police officers had been attacked with a range of blunt weapons), which, in turn, launched investigations based on charges filed by private citizens and by the Municipality of Panama in view of the damage caused to property; however, in none of the cases could any one person be identified as the perpetrator or a participant in the acts, given the tumultuous manner in which they took place; those arrested were assigned a legal representative, who was responsible for paying the individual fines imposed upon them for having disrupted public order; they were only held in custody for the time it took the competent authority to determine the appropriate imposition (fine); () on  March ,  workers from the construction project, who had each been fined  balboas for having disrupted public order in accordance with a resolution signed by their legal representative, were brought before the competent authority of Bella Vista. The Committee observes that the number of those arrested and fined differs according to the complainants and according to the Government, notes that the workers in question were released and requests the Government to indicate whether the workers arrested and fined have initiated judicial proceedings and, if this is the case, to communicate their",-1,2009,Panama
56,"outcome. In general, the Committee recalls that although the right of holding trade union meetings is an essential aspect of trade union rights, the organizations concerned must observe the general provisions relating to public meetings, which are applicable to all. This principle is contained in Article  of Convention No. , which provides that workers and their organizations, like other persons or organized collectivities, shall respect the law of the land [see Digest of the decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.As regards the submission by the Government of a bill establishing that job applicants must provide their  police records' (proving that they do not have a criminal record) prior to obtaining employment, which, in the view of the complainants, is an attempt to punish those having participated in the demonstrations, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement to the effect that the bill was approved by Act No.  of  April , which prescribes measures concerning the Personal Record Certificate, amends the Electoral Code and adds a section to the Criminal Code; the law does not seek to prevent demonstrations or curtail the right to organize, rather it seeks to provide information related to prison sentences handed down for crimes recorded over the last decade. The Committee observes that recording criminal records for labour-related purposes is not covered by the principles of freedom of association. However, given the importance that the complainants attach to this issue and their reservations about this law, the Committee invites the Government to submit this matter to a tripartite dialogue to ensure that criminal records acquired because of peaceful trade union activities do not have a bearing on obtaining employment.
.Lastly, as regards the investigation requested by the Committee regarding the allegations concerning the dismissal of over  workers belonging to SUNTRACS owing to their refusal to join another trade union allegedly established by the enterprise ODEBRECHT, the Committee notes that the Government sends information from the company indicating that, on  August , a considerable group of SUNTRACS members (more than ) arrived in hired buses on the premises of the company to demonstrate against the company workers who were members of SINTICOPP; owing to these problems, a member of SUNTRACS died, which led to a punishment being handed down to those involved by means of a judicial ruling; the company adds that the members of SUNTRACS did not work for the company. The Committee takes note of the company s statement to the effect that, currently, it enjoys good relations with the trade unions and has concluded collective agreements with both of them. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether judicial proceedings have been initiated by the workers concerned, and, if so, to indicate their outcome.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee once again deplores the murders, injuries and other acts of violence between  and  against trade union members and, in certain cases, against police officers. The Committee requests the Government to send the rulings issued and any future rulings in order to ensure that the facts have been clarified and that the guilty parties have been severely punished. The Committee requests the Government to convoke a tripartite dialogue with workers' and employers' organizations in the construction sector in order to examine the problems mentioned and to take all measures necessary to avoid a repeat of the acts of violence. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to communicate: () the rulings issued in relation to the alleged murder of the trade union officials Mr Luiyi Argelles and Mr Al Iromi Smith; () the rulings in relation to the injuries suffered by the trade union officials Mr David Nio and Mr Eustaquio Mndez on  August .(c)	The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether any judicial proceedings have been initiated against the trade union leader Mr Raymundo Garcs and, if this is the case, to communicate the ruling.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the workers Mr Donaldo Pinilla and Mr Flix de Len have filed criminal charges.(e)	The Committee once again requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged arrest and imposition of fines on more than  workers in the context of the demonstration of  February .(f)	The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the workers who were arrested and fined for the events that took place during the demonstration of  March  (all of whom were released) initiated judicial proceedings and, if this is the case, to communicate the outcome.(g)	The Committee invites the Government to submit the law concerning the use of criminal records for labour-related purposes (sentences handed down for crimes) to a tripartite dialogue, particularly to ensure that criminal records acquired because of peaceful trade union activities do not have a bearing on obtaining employment.(h)	The committee requests the Government to indicate whether judicial proceedings have been initiated by the workers concerned, and, if so, to indicate their outcome.(i)	The Committee calls the Governing Body s special attention to the extreme seriousness and urgency of the issues in this case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the Sole Union of Workers of the Construction and Related Industries (SUNTRACS) and the Independent National Confederation of Labour Union Unity (CONUSI) of March . SUNTRACS and CONUSI submitted additional information in a communication of  April . The Building and Wood Workers' International (BWI) associated itself with the complaint in a communication of  May .
.The Government sent partial observations in communications of  September  and  April .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of March  and  April , SUNTRACS and CONUSI allege murders, assaults and acts of violence against trade union officials and members and mass detentions of protestors against a background of grave anti-union persecution in Panama, as well as violations of the right to collective bargaining, the establishment of a trade union by an enterprise and anti-union dismissals.Acts of violence
.The complainant organizations allege that, on Saturday,  August , building workers belonging to SUNTRACS began strike action affecting the construction of the Panama Coln highway, a project being run by the enterprise Construtora Norberto Odebrecht SA. The authorities were unable to guarantee the workers' right to strike, with the latter being prevented from entering the enterprise s premises and then being attacked by hired thugs claiming to be officials of the trade union controlled by the enterprise.
.The complainant organizations add that, on  August , thugs hired by the enterprise physically and verbally abused the workers and members of the executive committee of SUNTRACS while they were picketing the enterprise s installations. The sub-secretary for monitoring of the executive committee of SUNTRACS, Mr David Nio, and Mr Adamson Ronald, the secretary for occupational safety and health of CONUSI, were injured as a result of this harassment. Moreover, Yamir Crdoba, Luis Gonzlez (both members of the executive committee of SUNTRACS) and Mr Eustaquio Mndez (secretary for finances of CONUSI) were physically attacked.
.The complainant organizations allege that, on  August , approximately  members of SUNTRACS, including trade union representatives and members of the executive committees of CONUSI and SUNTRACS, were again making their way towards the Panama Coln highway construction site with the aim of protesting peacefully against the attacks carried out on the abovementioned trade union officials. Between  a.m. and  a.m., hired thugs and common criminals armed with guns and in the pay of the enterprise attempted to murder SUNTRACS and CONUSI officials. Shots were fired from within the building site at the demonstrators who were protesting peacefully in front of the enterprise s installations. As a consequence, trade union official and SUNTRACS member, Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo Prez was killed and trade union officials Jos de los Santos Castillo Ceballos and Carlos Dimas Colindres Covilia were injured. The complainant organizations state that these events took place in the presence of members of the national police force, who remained suspiciously inactive thus allowing the hired thugs to carry out these criminal acts against the SUNTRACS and CONUSI members. SUNTRACS launched criminal proceedings in order to identify the authors and perpetrators of the murder of the trade union official Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo Prez. However, almost two years after the event the case remains unsolved. The complainant organizations believe that a climate of impunity and complicity on the part of the State exists with regards these events.
.The complainant organizations state that, on  June , SUNTRACS issued a public statement concerning the use of hired thugs as a part of the Isla Viveros project. Worker members of SUNTRACS consequently announced that they would carry out work stoppages and demonstrations against non-compliance with labour laws, precarious working, health and safety conditions and",1,2009,Panama
57,"anti-union practices. As a result of the protests, trade union official Mr Luiyi Antonio Argelles Moya was shot and killed by Sergeant Manuel Moreno of the Panamanian national police force on Isla Viveros on  August . On the same day, trade union official and SUNTRACS press and communications secretary, Mr Raimundo Garcs, was arrested.
.The complainants state that trade union official Mr Argelles Moya was murdered two days after the killing of Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo took place, but that, rather than investigating the complainants, the Government stated that SUNTRACS was the main party responsible for the events. SUNTRACS instituted criminal proceedings against Sergeant Manuel Moreno, the director of the national police force, the enterprise Maqtec SA and the mayoress of the judicial municipality, for the crime of homicide and breach of collective security. However, the complaint only pointed the finger of blame at Sergeant Moreno, exonerating the rest of those concerned. Almost two years have passed since the proceedings were launched but no sentence has been passed. The case is still pending before the Second High Court of the Judicial District of Panama, with no date as yet having been set for a hearing. The complainant organizations consider that the investigation process was carried out in a climate of absolute impunity, with the state apparatus taking the side of those presumed responsible.
.The complainant organizations state that, on  February , the workers of SUNTRACS carried out a national strike against the rise in the cost of living and in favour of the approval of a safety and health regulation in the construction sector. A peaceful demonstration held by the workers in the city of Coln was brutally suppressed. Against this background a SUNTRACS trade union official, Mr Al Iromi Smith, was murdered and workers Ronaldo Pinilia and Flix de Len were assaulted by members of the national police force. Mr Al Iromi Smith was a leading SUNTRACS official in Coln Province, as well as being a community leader and an active member of the student movement. He took part in various processes aimed at demanding the rights of the workers and even publicly denounced acts of political repression carried out by the Government in the media.
.The complainant organizations state that thousands of workers protested in the streets on hearing of the death of Mr Al Iromi Smith. The Government responded by arresting around  workers who were held at national police barracks where representatives of the Judiciary sentenced them for breach of public order. These proceedings were carried out with no regard for any rights whatsoever, violating all guarantees of due process. Fines of over US$ were imposed on the workers (paid by SUNTRACS in order that the protestors might be freed) . The complainant organizations state that criminal proceedings were instituted against Eliseo Madrid Valds and Miguel ngel Prez Ortega, members of the national police force, in the matter of the murder of trade union official Mr Al Iromi Smith. The preliminary proceedings carried out by the Third High Office of the Prosecutor of the First Judicial District of Panama are still ongoing and a number of anomalies have arisen. The complainant organizations consider that this delay, together with the faults made concerning the procedure, shows that the State has failed to ensure the right to freedom of association, given that the assaults and the murder were carried out in order to restrict the exercise of this right.
.The complainant organizations claim that, on  February, the national Ministry of the Economy and Finance announced that the Cabinet Council had approved a bill on tax reform which would involve the Government increasing the Goods and Services Transfer Tax from  to  per cent, alongside other measures prejudicial to the living conditions of workers and their families. On  March , the President of the Republic of Panama proceeded to approve the Tax Reform Act. The complainant organizations allege that on  March construction workers belonging to SUNTRACS took part in a protest meeting in the streets of the city and handed out pamphlets to passing motorists and pedestrians. Members of the national police force, acting under the orders of the President of the Republic, proceeded to repress the demonstration for no reason whatsoever. The police used tear gas, rubber bullets and buckshot and arrested  individuals, including  SUNTRACS members. The complainant organizations state that the detainees were transferred to the main headquarters of the national police force, where they were held in overcrowded facilities with no food being provided. Furthermore, the police refused to allow anyone to bring the protestors clothes, underclothes or toiletries. The detainees were also denied access to drinking water, before being transferred to the La Joya Penitentiary Centre.
.The complainant organizations add that on  March, following irregular proceedings, worker members of SUNTRACS were taken before magistrates in Calidonia and Bella Vista, where fines were imposed on them without it being proved in court that they had participated in the acts of which they had been accused. Moreover, they were informed that the Auxiliary Prosecutor of the Republic would continue to investigate those SUNTRACS members who had already been sanctioned by the magistrates, meaning that they were to be judged twice for the same offence.
.The complainant organizations state that on  March the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development harassed, slandered, insulted and threatened SUNTRACS members and their officials (in particular the trade union official Mr Sal Mndez) in the press. They go on to state that in February the Government submitted a bill under which any job applicant must produce his/her police record in order to obtain a post. The complainants allege that this bill was turned into a weapon to be used against the workers and the population in general, with participation in street protests being punished by prison sentences of six months to two years. This measure was used as a means of coercion following the events which took place on  March .Violation of the right to collective bargaining, establishment of a trade union by an enterprise, anti-union dismissals
.The complainant organizations allege that the enterprise Construtora Norberto Odebrecht SA began work on a project known as the  Madden Coln section' on  March  and that, on  March , the enterprise informed the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Development that ten workers had joined a trade union established with the sole objective of legitimizing a supposed collective agreement submitted to the Ministry on  March . According to the complainant organizations, it is clear that this alleged negotiation of a collective agreement was not carried out between the enterprise and a true trade union representation but that, in fact, the sole aim was to prevent those workers working on the construction project from exercising the collective freedoms of freedom of association and collective bargaining. The complainant organizations state that, following the signing of this false collective agreement, the enterprise required workers to join the  puppet' trade union as a prerequisite for working on the construction site. Many SUNTRACS worker members were forced to give up their membership and join the new trade union established by the enterprise. However, having obtained work and feeling that they were not represented, many workers rejoined SUNTRACS. The complainant organizations add that, in light of grave shortcomings regarding working conditions, the workers turned to SUNTRACS in order to denounce their precarious working situation, anti-union practices and the violation of the right to freedom of association. Therefore, on  May , SUNTRACS submitted a list of demands to the enterprise Retraneq SA (a subcontractor for Odebrecht). However, as no satisfactory solution was found for the workers, SUNTRACS was obliged to call for strike action on  June . On  May , SUNTRACS also submitted a list of demands directly to the enterprise Odebrecht, but, owing to threats of serious reprisals and pressure placed by the enterprise on the worker members of SUNTRACS, the list was withdrawn. The complainant organizations allege that over  worker members of SUNTRACS were dismissed for refusing to join the trade union established by the enterprise.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development carried out a far-reaching investigation which crossed the boundaries of the institution s jurisdiction. It was difficult to obtain relevant information regarding the events in question. As a result of the investigation doubts arose regarding the veracity of the allegations made by the complainant organizations. In some cases, the facts had been deliberately distorted and completely groundless accusations made which suggested that the Government was failing to comply with the ILO Conventions ratified by Panama. The Government states that, in order to clarify the situation, the Ministry has gathered the relevant information from various state bodies regarding the issues covered by the complaint submitted by SUNTRACS. As a result, the Government reports the following:' As to the allegation relating to the negotiation of a collective agreement within",-1,2009,Panama
58,"the enterprise Retraneq SA, Resolution No. -DGT-RT-, of  July , states that the National Construction and Drilling Industry Workers' Union of Panama (SINTICOPP) is responsible for negotiating lists of demands. Furthermore, Retraneq SA signed an agreement regarding the Madden Coln project, under which the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development (MITRADEL) was to mediate between SUNTRACS, SINTICOPP and the enterprise Retraneq SA. This enterprise did not take part in the negotiations carried out by MITRADEL. SUNTRACS declared that a strike would take place on  June  targeting the enterprise Retraneq SA;' With regards the murder of trade union official Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo Prez, in order to determine the legal actions that the judicial body of Panama as an independent organ of the executive body, and in light of the fact that offences against human life are investigated ex officio, as stated in section  of the Judicial Code of the Republic of Panama, the Supreme Court of Justice was requested to report on the legal proceedings carried out. In document No. SGP-, of  September , the Supreme Court of Justice stated that, through a decision of  May , the Second Court of Justice ruled that criminal proceedings should be initiated against Jorge Morgan, Eduardo Boyte Mathews, Jorge Coronado, Rogelio Ramos and Gustavo Santimateo Jean Franois for the crime of the intentional homicide of Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo Prez.' As to the murder of Mr Luiyi Argelles Moya, a certified report was requested of the judicial body regarding the status of the investigations. Through documentNo. SGP- of  September , the Second High Court of Justice, through ruling No.  of  September , initiated criminal proceedings against Csar Garay Carmona and Manuel Moreno Asprilla for the crime of the intentional homicide of Mr Luiyi Argelles.' As to the murder of trade union official Mr Al Iromi Smith, on  September , the Supreme Court of Justice reported that the Second High Court of Justice had ordered that Mr Eliseo Madrid be arrested and that precautionary measures be taken regarding Mr Miguel ngel Prez Ortega. The case is currently ongoing.
.The Government states that it does not nor will it in the future in any way persecute trade union officials or members. The Panamanian State, working through the judicial body, is making progress regarding these cases and has initiated criminal proceedings against those individuals suspected of being responsible for the deaths of the abovementioned trade union officials, thus ensuring that Panama is complying with due process as regards identifying those responsible for the events outlined in the complaint. As to the request for the organizations of the employers concerned in the case to provide the views of the enterprises involved in the case, the Government refers to the communications sent by the enterprises Maqtec SA, Grupo Viveros SA and Construtora Norberto Odebrecht SA.
.In a communication of  September , the enterprise Construtora Norberto Odebrecht SA of Panama states that it is the largest engineering and construction enterprise in Latin America and one of the largest such enterprises in the world. It has been providing integrated services in the engineering, supply, construction, installation and management of civil, industrial and specialized technology works for  years. The enterprise has completed over , projects around the world, in regions as diverse as Asia, Africa, Latin America and North America and in particular in the United States. As an enterprise, Odebrecht respects the rights of the workers, the fundamental principles of labour as set out by the ILO and the enterprise s own principles, and complies with national labour standards. Before beginning work in any country, the first thing the enterprise does is to hire local specialists, in particular in the fields of law, labour, finance, accounting, etc., so that they may provide guidance regarding the fundamental aspects of law, especially concerning taxation, labour, corporations, etc. This is done in order to avoid making mistakes which could later on be interpreted as violations of national law. In all of the projects undertaken by the enterprise, including those which are ongoing, the activities of the enterprise regarding the workers have been carried out within the legal, regulatory framework, in particular the Labour Code and collective agreements.
.In , the enterprise began its first project in Panama, the construction of an irrigation system known as the Remigio Rojas project, in Chiriqu Province. This project provided Panamanian producers with an innovative irrigation system which benefitted their agricultural activities, as well as directly generating employment for over  workers and many other indirectly related posts. Work then began on the construction of the Madden Coln highway and the Coastal Beltway on one of the most important avenues of the Panamanian capital, along which over , vehicles pass every day. The enterprise states that, in order to comply with Panamanian labour law, the enterprise negotiated and signed a collective agreement with SINTICOPP, a trade union organization recognized by the Ministry of Labour and which represented the majority of the workers working on the Remigio Rojas project in Chiriqu. Thus, SUNTRACS did not present any valid proof to support its allegation that freedom of association had been violated and that there was no collective agreement in place and therefore this claim is incorrect and groundless.
.As to the Madden Coln highway, once the Government allowed work to go ahead, a dialogue was initiated with SINTICOPP, which has legal representativity regarding the country s construction workers. This negotiation process was carried out completely in accordance with legislation.
.As to the list of demands submitted by SUNTRACS to the enterprise Retraneq SA, it should be pointed out that in the same complaint it is stated that this enterprise is a subcontractor for Odebrecht. Therefore, the list of demands that SUNTRACS claims to have presented to Odebrecht later on was not attributable to that enterprise, given that the relationship with Retraneq S.A. was one of subcontraction within the normal course of activities of both enterprises and not a relationship of legal subordination and economic dependence. Odebrecht had (and has) no obligations whatsoever towards the workers of Retraneq SA, the latter enterprise having been contracted to provide specialized services.
.With regards the Coastal Beltway and New Roadway projects, a collective agreement was negotiated and signed with SUNTRACS. Therefore, it is not true to say that Odebrecht fails to respect trade union freedoms or that it does not enter into negotiations given that it did sign a contract with SUNTRACS. The enterprise adds that it is important to point out that, alongside the abovementioned projects, it has undertaken another major project which is currently ongoing. The project in question is a  megawatt (MW) hydroelectric project, as a part of which a collective agreement was signed with SUNTRACS. Therefore SUNTRACS' claim to the effect that Odebrecht only signed a collective agreement with the trade union with regards the Coastal Beltway project is untrue. SUNTRACS officials have access to the enterprise should they wish to discuss any issues regarding the labour anagement relationship, as was made clear in the collective agreements that were signed.
.As to the allegation that Odebrecht controls SINTICOPP, this claim is both groundless and bizarre. It is difficult to understand how SUNTRACS could claim that Odebrecht controls a trade union which was established long before the enterprise began working in Panama. Moreover, two collective agreements were signed with SUNTRACS relating to various projects. If SINTICOPP were really controlled by Odebrecht then the enterprise would hardly have signed collective agreements with other trade union entities.
.As to the unfortunate death of Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo Prez, which occurred close to the site of the Madden Coln project and for which, according to SUNTRACS s irresponsible claims, Odebrecht is to blame: on the morning of  August , a large group (according to the complaint, around ) of SUNTRACS members were bussed for free to the enterprise s installation at the camping resort of Chilibre. At this time the workers there were beginning work but they were harassed by the SUNTRACS members. The workers gathered at the building site hut. They did not seek to establish any kind of contact with the SUNTRACS members. The SUNTRACS members had travelled from various parts of the country specifically in order to carry out a  protest' in front of the enterprise s installations. Therefore, the claim contained in the complaint to the effect that the events that occurred amounted to a  premeditated and planned action' are utterly false, given that at no time did the enterprise plan to confront the SUNTRACS members or indulge in any interference which might provoke SUNTRACS members into harassing the enterprise s workers at Chilibre. The tragic death of the SUNTRACS member occurred in the heat of the moment. This event was investigated by the competent authorities (the Office of the Public Prosecutor) and the enterprise has cooperated fully with every request made of it. Odebrecht has at all times worked closely with the national police, the Office of the Public Prosecutor and the judicial body",0,2009,Panama
59,"in order to uncover the facts.
.Finally, the enterprise states that the complaint contains subjective claims made by SUNTRACS which neither the enterprise nor any authority which is not the judicial body are competent to make.
.In its capacity as the developer of the Isla Viveros project, the enterprise Grupo Viveros SA signed a civil works contract with the construction enterprise Maqtec SA for the construction of various works within the Isla Viveros project. Maqtec SA signed a four-year (' ) collective agreement with SINTICOPP on  October . This agreement was registered by the Department for Labour Relations on  October . On  January , SUNTRACS submitted a list of demands to the General Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development. The first point of the list established the following: Claims. ' . That the enterprise, given that no collective agreement exists, should be obliged to negotiate the list of claims and thus grant a collective labour agreement between SUNTRACS and Maqtec SA'  The enterprise states that in light of this situation it is clear that the first request on the list together with the other claims were groundless, given that the enterprise Maqtec SA had already signed a collective agreement with another trade union in  for a duration of four years.
.The enterprise states that the law clearly points out that a new collective agreement may only be signed with the enterprise if there is no pre-existing agreement in force or if the previous agreement has expired. Because of this situation the list of charges followed its course until a strike was called, illegally as it happens given that when voting on strike action took place SUNTRACS did not have enough workers to declare the strike legal as established by section  of the Labour Code. In this case they did not have the majority necessary to declare a legal strike. Thus, an arbitration process was initiated. The list was filed through an arbitration award of  March .
.The enterprise adds that on  July  SUNTRACS submitted a new list, with SINTICOPP submitting another one on  June . The Ministry of Labour and Labour Development of Panama, acting on behalf of the General Labour Directorate of Panama, ruled that SINTICOPP (which at the time had the largest number of members working on the site) was the competent party with regards negotiations concerning the lists. SUNTRACS called a strike as of  June . Events came to a head on that Thursday, with SUNTRACS members provoking and confronting worker members of SINTICOPP on various occasions. As a result, complainant No. CL was submitted to the Office of the Public Prosecutor by Maqtec SA. The enterprise states that, owing to the insecurity and vandalism that affected the project, homeowners in Panama at the time could not access their properties.
.As a result of the events linked to the strike affecting the workers on the Maqtec SA site, houses Nos  and  were completely vandalized. According to information received, a SUNTRACS protestor died during a clash with members of the police force on the site of the Isla Viveros project in the Las Perlas archipelago. The deceased was Mr Luiyi Argelles, a SUNTRACS member, who, as far as we know, was responsible for mobilizing protesters and belonged to the shock unit within the project. He was not on the staff of any of the enterprises or suppliers involved in the project.
.The enterprise states that the Isla Viveros project is a special tourist project. It is situated on an island far from the mainland which has  km of beach and coastline that can be landed on at any point. The conflict in question was not limited to the area in and around the construction site. SUNTRACS took over the entire island by force. This island is private property, with full title of ownership, and in this case the fundamental guarantees provided for in the Constitution were violated. SUNTRACS submitted a criminal complaint against the head of the Panamanian national police force and those police officers present on the day the events took place. The same complaint incriminated the director of the Isla Viveros project (checks later carried out showed that he was not involved in the unfortunate events of  August ). As a result of this conflict, SUNTRACS and its regional branches at a provincial level held constant protests in the various provincial capitals with the aim of pressuring the enterprise into signing a collective agreement. Following negotiations and dialogue, Maqtec SA and SUNTRACS signed an agreement on  October  in order to calm the situation and get work on the Isla Viveros project back on track. The project is now under way again and relations with SUNTRACS are the best in the country. It should be pointed out that the case of the police officers who were unfortunately involved in the death of Mr Luiyi Argelles is before the Second High Court of Justice of Panama, with the charges currently being specified.
.The enterprise Maqtec SA sent a communication reiterating the statements made by Grupo Viveros SA.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the Second High Court of Justice issued ruling No. -P-I, concerning the cases of Jorge Morgan Melchor, Rogelio Ramos Camargo and Miguel ngel Ibarra, accused of the murder of Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo, a SUNTRACS member, on  March . Under this ruling, Jorge Morgan Melchor and Miguel ngel Ibarra were sentenced to  years in prison and barred from exercising public functions for a period of five years once their prison sentences had been completed. Moreover, Mr Rogelio Ramos was sentenced to  years in prison and barred from exercising public functions for five years. The Government reports that the cases concerning the murders of Mr Luiyi Argelles and Mr Al Iromi Smith, members of SUNTRACS, are currently being examined by the courts and that it will provide information on any progress made in this regard.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organizations allege murders, assaults, acts of violence against trade union officials and members and mass detentions of protestors, as well as violations of the right to collective bargaining, the establishment of a trade union by an enterprise and anti-union dismissals.
.As to the allegations regarding murders and other acts of violence against trade union officials and members and mass detentions of protestors in the construction sector, the Committee observes with concern that the complainant organizations refer to:' The murder of SUNTRACS trade union official Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo Prez, on  August , during a demonstration at the Panama Coln highway construction site, a project being run by the enterprise Odebrecht (according to the complainant, hired thugs and criminals in the pay of the enterprise used firearms against SUNTRACS members);and the injuries suffered by trade union officials Mr David Nio, a member of the SUNTRACS executive committee, and the secretary for finances of CONUSI, Mr Eustaquio Mndez;' The murder of trade union official Mr Luiyi Antonio Argelles Moya on  August  by a sergeant of the national police during a demonstration at the site of Maqtec SA s Isla Viveros project; and the detention of the SUNTRACS press and communications secretary, Mr Raimundo Garcs.' The murder of SUNTRACS official Mr Al Iromi Smith, the incident in which Donaldo Pinilla and Flix de Len were attacked by police officers using firearms on  February  while they were taking part in a peaceful demonstration as part of a national strike and the arrest of and imposition of fines on over  workers who were protesting as a result of the death of the trade union official.' The violent repression and arrest by the police of  workers (including  members of SUNTRACS) participating in a demonstration on  March  and the imposition of fines on the abovementioned workers.' The submission by the Government of a bill establishing that job applicants must provide their  police records' (proving that they do not have a criminal record) prior to obtaining employment, which, in the view of the complainants, is an attempt to punish those having participated in the demonstrations.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement to the effect that: () as regards the legal proceedings concerning the murder of Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo Perz, the Second High Court of Justice issued a ruling condemning Jorge Morgan and Miguel ngel Ibarra to  years in prison and barring them from exercising public functions for a period of five years once their prison sentences had been completed. Moreover, Mr Rogelio Ramos was sentenced to  years in prison and barred from exercising public functions for five years; () the cases concerning the murders of Mr Luiyi Argelles and Mr Al Iromi Smith are currently being examined by the courts and that it will provide information on any progress made in this regard.
.Moreover, the Committee notes that, as regards the death of Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo Perz, the enterprise Odebrecht",-1,2009,Panama
60,"states that: (a) on  August ,  SUNTRACS members demonstrated outside the enterprise s installations, harassing workers who were beginning their working day; (b) it was during these events that the death of the trade union official occurred, and (c) at no time did the enterprise confront the SUNTRACS members. Furthermore it has cooperated fully with the national police, the Office of the Public Prosecutor and the judicial authority in order to establish the facts. Moreover, the enterprises Grupo Viveros SA and Maqtec SA state as regards the death of Mr Luiyi Argelles that: (i) SUNTRACS declared a strike on  June  during which acts of provocation and confrontation were perpetrated against workers belonging to another trade union; (ii) as a result of the violence, the homes of some of the enterprise s workers were destroyed; (iii) the death of Mr Luiyi Argelles, who was not employed by either of the enterprises, occurred during the events in question; (iv) an investigation showed that the director of the Isla Viveros project did not take part in the violence and the project is currently under way, with relations with SUNTRACS being much improved, an agreement having been signed with the trade union on  October ; and (v) the Second High Court of Justice of Panama is investigating the participation of those police officers involved in the death of Mr Luiyi Argelles.
.The Committee, although taking note of the efforts made to arrest and convict those responsible for the murder of Mr Osvaldo Lorenzo Perz, deeply regrets the alleged acts of violence, regrets that the investigations aimed at identifying and punishing the culprits have yet to be concluded and recalls that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement cannot develop within the construction sector in a climate of violence which gives rise to the murder of trade union officials and assaults on trade union members. The Committee firmly expects that the ongoing investigations into the murders of Mr Luiyi Argelles and Mr Al Iromi Smith will be concluded without delay and that those responsible for the events in question will consequently be punished and requests the Government to inform it of any rulings issued in this regard. Moreover, the Committee urges the Government without delay to send its observations regarding the following allegations: () the injuries suffered by trade union officials Mr David Nio, a member of the SUNTRACS executive committee, and the secretary for finances of CONUSI, Mr Eustaquio Mndez, on  August ; () the detention of SUNTRACS press and communications secretary, Mr Raimundo Garcs; () the incident in which police officers attacked workers Donaldo Pinilla and Flix de Len using firearms on  February  while they were taking part in a peaceful demonstration as part of a national strike and the arrest of and imposition of fines on over  workers who were protesting as a result of the death of the trade union official Mr Al Iromi Smith; () the violent repression and arrest by the police of  workers (including  members of SUNTRACS) participating in a demonstration on  March  and the imposition of fines on the abovementioned workers; and () the submission by the Government of a bill establishing that job applicants must provide their  police records' (proving that they do not have a criminal record) prior to obtaining employment which, in the view of the complainants, is an attempt to punish those having participated in the demonstrations.
.As to the allegations regarding the establishment of a trade union by the enterprise Odebrecht at the site of the Madden Coln highway project, the signing of a  false' collective agreement with the abovementioned trade union, the dismissal of over  workers belonging to SUNTRACS for having refused to join the trade union established by the enterprise and the refusal of the enterprise Retraneq SA (a subcontractor for Odebrecht, according to the complainants) to negotiate a list of claims submitted by SUNTRACS, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () through Resolution No. -DGT-RT-, of  July , the administrative authority ruled that SINTICOPP was responsible for negotiating lists of claims with the enterprise Retraneq SA; () Retraneq SA signed an agreement regarding the Madden Coln project and, as a consequence, the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development attempted to mediate between SUNTRACS, SINTICOPP and the enterprise Retraneq SA, but the enterprise did not participate, and () SUNTRACS called for strike action affecting the enterprise Retraneq SA.
.The Committee also notes that the Government sent the observations transmitted by the enterprise Odebrecht in which its states that: () in compliance with legislation, the enterprise negotiated and signed a collective agreement with SINTICOPP, a trade union organization recognized by the Ministry of Labour which represented the majority of the workers; () this enterprise does not control SINTICOPP, a body which was established long before the enterprise began operating in Panama; () the list submitted by SUNTRACS to the enterprise Retraneq SA was not attributable (that is to say relevant) to that enterprise, given that the relationship between the enterprises is not one of legal subordination and economic dependence, and; () the enterprise has signed collective agreements with SUNTRACS regarding other construction projects, with the officials of the trade union having access to the enterprise should they wish to discuss any issues regarding the labour anagement relationship.
.In these conditions, the Committee requests the Government to take promptly the necessary measures to carry out an investigation without delay regarding the allegations concerning the dismissal of over  workers belonging to SUNTRACS owing, according to the complainant, to their refusal to join another trade union established by the enterprise and to inform the Committee of the results of this investigation and, given that the allegations date back to , to report on the current state of labour relations between the enterprises concerned and the trade unions in the construction sector.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee firmly expects that the ongoing investigations into the murders of Mr Luiyi Argelles and Mr Al Iromi Smith will be concluded without delay and that those responsible for the events in question will consequently be punished and requests the Government to inform it of any rulings issued.(b) The Committee urges the Government without delay to send its observations regarding the following allegations: () the injuries suffered by trade union officials Mr David Nio, a member of the SUNTRACS executive committee, and the secretary for finances of CONUSI, Mr Eustaquio Mndez, on  August ; () the detention of SUNTRACS press and communications secretary, Mr Raimundo Garcs; () the incident in which police officers attacked workers Messrs Donaldo Pinilla and Flix de Len using firearms on  February  while they were taking part in a peaceful demonstration as part of a national strike and the arrest of and imposition of fines on over  workers who were protesting as a result of the death of the trade union official Mr Al Iromi Smith; () the violent repression and arrest by the police of  workers (including  members of SUNTRACS) participating in a demonstration on  March  and the imposition of fines on the abovementioned workers, and; () the submission by the Government of a bill establishing that job applicants must provide their  police records' (proving that they do not have a criminal record) prior to obtaining employment, which, in the view of the complainants, is an attempt to punish those having participated in the demonstrations.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take promptly the necessary measures to carry out an investigation without delay regarding the allegations concerning the dismissal of over  workers belonging to SUNTRACS owing to their refusal to join another trade union allegedly established by the enterprise Odebrecht and to inform the Committee of the results of this investigation and, given that the allegations date back to , to report on the current state of labour relations between the enterprises concerned and the trade unions in the construction sector.(d) The Committee draws the Governing Body s attention to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.",-1,2009,Panama
61,".The complaint is contained in a communication sent by the National Council of Organized Workers of Panama (CONATO), dated  October . The Government submitted its observations in a communication dated  March .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , CONATO alleges that, in January , the National Association of Occupational Health Workers (ANATSO) filed an application with the Ministry of Government and Justice for legal personality, which had not been granted at the time the complaint was presented.
.CONATO states that on  May , the Ministry of Government and Justice ordered the union to amend its statutes, drawn up in January , which the applicants did. On  July , the amendments were submitted to the Ministry of Government and Justice. On  September , the same amendments had to be resubmitted, together with new amendments requested by the Ministry, because the Ministry of Government and Justice  had misplaced them'  On  April , the Ministry of Government and Justice once again requested amendments to the draft statutes. On  April , these amendments were submitted to the Ministry. On  May , however, the Ministry of Government and Justice requested further amendments to the draft statutes, to conform with the observations of the Social Insurance Fund (CSS), which the Ministry of Government and Justice had consulted regarding the content of the statutes, and which had submitted its observations on  April  (in other words, on  April the Ministry of Government and Justice had been aware of the CSS s observations, but had not included them in the observations which it requested on that date).
.According to CONATO, most of the observations and requests for amendments by the CSS, which the Ministry of Government and Justice asked the union to carry out in May , had already been incorporated.
.CONATO cites Article  of Convention No.  relating to the freedom to establish trade union organizations without interference from the public authorities, and highlights the constant requests for amendments and the negligence of the authorities which, in its opinion, resulted in a violation of freedom of association.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government states that, in a decision dated  March , the Ministry of Government and Justice granted legal personality to ANATSO. The Government encloses a copy of the decision, which states that the trade union had welcomed the observations and recommendations made in relation to its statutes, and that the documentation submitted was in compliance with the applicable legislation.
.Lastly, the Government considers that the complaint presented by CONATO is now groundless.
.The Committee observes that in the present complaint, the complainant organization alleges a delay of more than two years in the granting of legal personality, due to successive requests for amendments to the union s statutes by the Ministry of Government and Justice (the complainant organization encloses the relevant documentation and stresses that some of the amendments concerned points on which no objections had previously been raised) and the negligence of the authorities, who even requested amendments that had already been made.
.The Committee notes with interest the Government s statement that ANATSO was granted legal personality on  March . However, the Committee regrets the excessive delay in processing the application, given that the request for legal personality was first submitted in January .
.The Committee also observes that this delay was partly due to the fact that the Ministry of Government and Justice sent the ANATSO statutes to the CSS, so that it could offer its observations, which the Committee considers to be contrary to the principle that employers or their organizations should not be involved in the procedure for granting legal personality to trade unions. The Committee requests the Government to refrain in the future from asking an employer to provide observations concerning the statutes of a trade union which the workers have decided to establish.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to ensure in the future that applications for legal personality are handled rapidly and without undue delays in regard to amendments which need to be made to statutes to ensure compliance with the applicable legislation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Regretting the excessive delay in the granting of legal personality to ANATSO, the Committee requests the Government to ensure in future that applications for legal personality filed by trade unions are handled rapidly and without undue delays.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure in future that, when trade unions apply to the authorities for legal personality, the latter do not ask employers or their organizations for their observations.",0,2008,Panama
62,".In its previous examination of the case in June  [see th Report, para. ], the Committee stated that it understands that in accordance with national legislation the complainant organization (SINTUP), which is a workers' organization in a public university, may not be established as a trade union regulated by the Labour Code, but must instead be established as an association and be covered by the Administrative Careers Act. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the members of such associations, and in particular those of SINTUP, are guaranteed protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and whether they have the right to collective bargaining and to strike, and, if so, to provide the relevant legal provisions.
.In its communication of  September , the Government provides the legal provisions that guarantee the right of public servants to strike. The Government also provides the legal provisions applicable to public servants' associations (recognition, legal personality and the right to form federations and confederations) contained in the Administrative Careers Act of . As regards the right to collective bargaining, the Government states that section  of the aforementioned law provides that:Section : Any collective conflicts that arise as a consequence of the service relationship established in the present law should be resolved, in the first instance, within the institution where they originated, by the executive committee of the workers' association of the institution and the relevant administrative authorities, within ten days of the formal submission of the relevant request.
.The Government adds that, in accordance with the aforementioned law, it has been complying with the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association on this case within the relevant framework of established national legislation, and reiterates that it respects the Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining that it has ratified, which is why it has been making every effort to ensure their full implementation within a framework of dialogue with the social partners involved.
.The Committee notes that public servants enjoy the right to strike but observes that the Government has not referred to any legal provisions that protect public servants against acts of anti-union discrimination or interference, nor has it referred to any provisions that clearly regulate the right to collective bargaining of public servants (the Government refers only to conflict resolution, which is dealt with succinctly in section  of the Administrative Careers Act), who should enjoy such rights since only the armed forces, the police or  public servants engaged in the administration of the State' (which does not include the staff working in public universities such as that represented by the complainant) are not included in the scope of Convention No. . Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that national legislation guarantees the public servants who do not work in the administration of the State, including employees of public universities, adequate protection against anti union discrimination and interference, as well as the right to collective bargaining. The Committee reminds the Government that, should it wish to avail itself of ILO technical assistance, it is at its disposal.
.When it last examined this case at its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the issues that remained pending in relation to the refusal to register a workers' organization (SINTUP) in a public university [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee notes the complainant organization s explanations as to why it chose not to establish itself in accordance with the regulations governing the right to organize in the public sector. In this respect, while it recalls that workers in public or private universities shall have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing and to join them, and the right to collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations with regard to the complainant s allegations and, in particular, with regard to the difficulties and restrictions that are damaging associations of public servants. The Committee emphasizes that whatever the legislation covering the right of association of workers in public universities may be, it must fully recognize the rights enshrined in Conventions Nos  and , and it requests the Government to specify in its reply whether the legislation guarantees those rights, including protection against anti-union discrimination and the right to collective bargaining of workers' organizations in public universities.
.In its communication dated  December , the Government repeats that under Panamanian positive law, there is a clear and well-defined difference between a  trade union organization' and an  association of public servants'  The Labour Code does not govern labour relations between public servants and government or public institutions, as stipulated in the final paragraph of article , which provides that:  Public employees shall be governed by the administrative career regulations, except where specific provision is made for the application of any rules of the present Code'  The Political Constitution of the Republic determines that public servants are persons who are appointed to posts in autonomous, semi-autonomous and other entities, and who are remunerated by the State; the provisions of the Labour Code do not apply to them, but instead those of the Administrative Careers Act. Consequently, the General Labour Directorate, by way of Resolution No. .DOS. of  September , ruled not to allow the request to grant legal personality to the complainant organization (SINTUP) on the grounds that it was against the Constitution and the law. This resolution was confirmed by the Court of Second Instance in Resolution No. D.M. / of  December .
.The Government goes on to say that for SINTUP to be considered as a trade union organization, the Political Constitution would have to be amended, which would be no easy task according to article , Title XIII, of the Constitution, entitled  Constitutional Reform'  which establishes the relevant conditions and procedures. The Government reiterates that it respects the Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining that it has ratified, which is why it has been making every effort to ensure their full implementation within a framework of dialogue with the social partners. The current labour administration authority within the Ministry of Labour, in view of the current situation and in order to comply with Conventions Nos  and  on freedom of association and to promote social dialogue, has been examining the possibility of establishing a Higher Labour Council, to be the consultative tripartite arm of the executive body, with the principal aim of regulating dialogue and promoting economic and social cooperation between the public authorities and the employers' and workers' organizations of the country in respect of labour issues, with the technical support of the ILO.
.The Committee notes this information. It understands that in accordance with national legislation the complainant organization (SINTUP), which is a workers' organization in a public university, may not be established as a trade union regulated by the Labour Code, but must instead be established as an association and be covered by the Administrative Careers Act. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the members of such associations, and in particular those of SINTUP, are guaranteed protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and whether they have the right to collective bargaining and to strike, and, if so, to provide the relevant legal provisions.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, on examining allegations regarding the refusal to recognize the legal personality of the National Union of Workers of the University of Panama (SINTUP) it made the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expects that the Government will send it the ruling issued by the Supreme Court of Justice with respect to the authorities' refusal to recognize that the complainant trade union has legal personality and expects that the Court will issue its ruling in this regard in the near future.(b) The Committee requests the complainant organization to indicate the reasons why it chose not to establish itself in accordance with the regulations governing the right to organize in the public sector.
.In its communication dated  January , SINTUP refers to the Government s reply concerning the case and specifically to the claims that the union s request was not accepted on the grounds that it was  against the Political Constitution of the Republic and against the law' and that the  documentation submitted in support of the application contains flaws that need to be rectified'  SINTUP states that the flaws are not in the documentation submitted, but in outdated regulations contained in the Constitution and the Labour Code, which serve only to deprive public service workers of fundamental human rights, the same rights that both legal instruments clearly recognize for private sector workers, including workers at private universities. According to the complainant organization, this represents a clear violation of the Constitution on the grounds of non-compliance with article  which establishes that  there shall be no exemptions or privileges, nor discrimination on the basis of race, birth, disability, social class,",-1,2008,Panama
63,"sex, religion or political ideas'  The regulations cited to deny the legal existence of SINTUP point to the tendentious refusal to recognize as workers all those who work for the State, placing them in a category called  public servants' (Title XI of the Political Constitution) and to the biased and narrow interpretation of what an enterprise is and what it represents. However, the much cited Title XI blatantly contradicts the Constitution itself, where none of the  articles of Title III, Chapter , referring to work, make reference to so-called public servants, but instead to  any worker in the service of the State or of a public enterprise' (article ).
.SINTUP adds the following in respect of the Committee s recommendations: as regards recommendation (a) the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama responded to the amparo (protection of constitutional rights) request for constitutional guarantees lodged by the trade union on  October  with a statement by the full court bench dated  March . In its judgement, as can be seen, it resorts to a technicality, finding a  flaw' in the amparo action and questioning a note and a signature. It is clear to SINTUP that there was no intention of considering the substance of the matter.
.With regard to the Committee s recommendation (b), SINTUP states that it is entirely wrong to conclude that the union should be refused legal recognition as a union because it requests legal personality under the Labour Code and not under provisions contained in the Administrative Career Act. There is no provision in either the single text of the Administrative Career Act of  August , nor in Act No.  of  July  that amends it, that governs  the trade union rights of public servants in autonomous institutions, such as the University of Panama'  let alone for all other so-called public servants. Likewise, none of this legislation makes provision for an administrative authority where public service workers can request the registration of a trade union. Consequently, it is impossible to seek to legalize a trade union in Panamanian public institutions through administrative career regulations. The Administrative Career Act grants the right of association, but completely denies the right of public sector workers to establish trade unions. Furthermore, associations of public servants that can be established, can only do so with serious and unfair limitations, including the following: (i) not all workers can belong to them; only permanently appointed public servants, who make up a tiny portion of the government labour force; (ii) the associations' officials are not entitled to immunity from dismissal. This was eliminated in the amendments introduced in Act No.  of  July ; (iii) the number of so-called permanently appointed public servants necessary to form an association was raised from  to  or more, a figure significantly higher than that required under the Labour Code to establish a trade union; (iv) although the right to strike is established, it is subject to a regulation that has not been established; (v) the right to the collective negotiation of conflicts exists, but not of working conditions. Since the entry into force of Act No.  of  June  no state institution has negotiated a collective agreement; and (vi) the stability of public servants is extremely precarious and is undermined with every change of Government. Thus, article  of Act No.  of  July   set aside all the acts of incorporation of permanently appointed public servants issued as from the implementation of Act No.  of '  This turned several thousand workers who thought they were achieving permanent status in their positions into casual workers.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that the Supreme Court of Justice ruled on the refusal to grant the complainant trade union legal personality in a decision dated  March  in which the amparo appeal for protection of constitutional rights lodged by Mr Eliecer Chacn Arias was declared not receivable, on the grounds of procedural irregularity of the appeal. The Government indicates that in this regard the national Government has no direct responsibility for the decision because any request by a workers' social organization must comply with the requirements of the Political Constitution; consequently, public servants are governed by the principle of legality whereby they can only do what they are permitted to do by law. Evidence of this is the fact that in private universities, trade union organizations have been allowed with no qualms as they are private entities, but the same is not true in the public service universities, as is the case of the University of Panama. Lastly, the Government states that it has recently received a copy of a communication dated  January  from SINTUP containing additional information in respect of the follow-up to the Committee s recommendations concerning the complaint, and that it will send its observations in due course.
.The Committee notes this information. In particular, the Committee notes the complainant organization s explanations as to why it chose not to establish itself in accordance with the regulations governing the right to organize in the public sector. In this respect, while it recalls that workers in public or private universities shall have the right to establish organizations of their own choosing and to join them, and the right to collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations with regard to the complainant s allegations and, in particular, with regard to the difficulties and restrictions that are damaging associations of public servants. The Committee emphasizes that whatever the legislation covering the right of association of workers in public universities may be, it must fully recognize the rights enshrined in Conventions Nos  and , and it requests the Government to specify in its reply whether the legislation guarantees those rights, including protection against anti-union discrimination and the right to collective bargaining of workers' organizations in public universities.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Union of Workers of the University of Panama (SINTUP) dated  November . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that in the present complaint, the complainant organization alleges that the Ministry of Labour refused to recognize its legal personality despite the fact that the union complied with all the legal formalities, and also that the first-instance decision of  September  refusing registration was upheld on appeal by the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development (Ministry of Labour). The complainant further states that it submitted a second application for recognition of its legal personality on  July  and this was also refused, this time by the head of the Department of Social Organizations. This led the union to file an appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice (for errors of form in the last refusal to recognize its legal personality) and no ruling has yet been issued in this regard.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that the grounds for non-recognition of legal personality are as follows: although the complainant trade union (SINTUP) wished to be operational at the University of Panama, it applied for registration as an  enterprise trade union'  whereas the University of Panama is an autonomous institution with public servants (and not an enterprise with workers within the meaning of the Labour Code);and the Labour Code is not applicable at the University of Panama since public employees are governed specifically by the administrative career regulations (as recognized by another part of the Labour Code) and receive remuneration from the State. The Committee notes the Government s emphasis that the judicial authority upheld the administrative decision refusing to recognize the legal personality of the trade union. Finally, the Committee notes the Government s confirmation that the Supreme Court of Justice has not yet issued a ruling on the amparo appeal filed by the complainant because of a second refusal to recognize the union s legal personality.
.The Committee concludes that the Ministry of Labour s refusal to recognize the legal personality of the complainant trade union is because the complainant sought to be subject, as an enterprise union, to the provisions of the Labour Code instead of being covered by the provisions of the Administrative Career Act, which govern the trade union rights of public servants in autonomous institutions, as in the case of the University of Panama. Although the Committee considers that there are no grounds for challenging the validity of special legal regulations which govern public servants' right to organize in so far as such regulations comply with the provisions of Convention No.  (a point not mentioned by the complainant), it observes that the complainant has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice citing errors of form in the decision refusing",0,2008,Panama
64,"to recognize its legal personality. The Committee expects that the Government will send it the ruling issued by the Supreme Court of Justice and expects that the Court will issue its ruling in this regard in the near future.
.The Committee requests the complainant organization to indicate the reasons why it chose not to establish itself in accordance with the regulations governing the right to organize in the public sector.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expects that the Government will send it the ruling issued by the Supreme Court of Justice with respect to the authorities' refusal to recognize that the complainant trade union has legal personality and expects that the Court will issue its ruling in this regard in the near future.(b) The Committee requests the complainant organization to indicate the reasons why it chose not to establish itself in accordance with the regulations governing the right to organize in the public sector.",1,2008,Panama
65,".In its previous examination of the case at its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, paras  and ]:(a) Regarding the alleged anti-union dismissal of union leaders Mr Cubilla, Mr Adamson and Mr Aguilar, the Committee recalls that, in its previous examination of the case, it observed that according to the allegations the judicial authority did not accede to the company s request for a suspension of their trade union immunity, and that the Committee therefore requested the Government to ensure that they had been able to return to their posts of work. Noting the Government s assertion that the situation has changed inasmuch as the demonstration was an act of violence and not a peaceful protest, the Committee requests it to inform it without delay of the current status of the workers involved and, specifically, whether they are still covered by their trade union immunity. The Committee also requests the Government to inform it whether any proceedings have been initiated in connection with what the Government describes as an act of violence against the installations of Union International Network GSW.(b) Regarding the alleged dismissal (as part of a corporate restructuring) of dozens of other workers said to have been involved in the October  protest march, the Committee notes that the Government does not provide any information as to whether the trade unions concerned or the union members themselves have initiated any further court action, and it can therefore not determine whether or not all the remaining dismissals were considered to have been justified. The Committee requests the Government to provide it without delay with information on the subject, together with copies of the court decisions handed down.(c) Regarding the company s alleged failure to pass on union dues to the union or to comply with the laws and regulations on the subject, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether the company has deducted any union dues that have not been credited to the trade union concerned and, if so, to ensure that this is done without delay.(d) Regarding the alleged violent attack on trade unionists and the theft of their belongings by individuals who had received orders from the management to remove them from the premises, where they were exercising their right to protest against the company, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to indicate whether there has been any investigation into the matter or if the victims have lodged any judicial appeals and to keep it informed of developments.(e) Regarding the alleged financial support provided by the company for setting up a new trade union, the Committee notes the Government s statement that it is unaware of any such occurrence and its reliance on the country s laws and regulations. The Committee requests the Government to order an inquiry into the allegations and to keep it informed accordingly.(f) Regarding the other allegations ' threatened civil or criminal sanctions against trade unionists who took part in the demonstrations, certification (recognition) of trade union elections involving a very small group of dissidents from the union and the union s request for collective negotiations (the list of demands that had been settled by an agreement concluded in September  was resubmitted in October ) ' the Committee regrets to note that the Government has not provided any information on the subject. The Committee requests the Government to institute an inquiry without delay into the alleged threats of civil and criminal sanctions against trade unionists who took part in the demonstrations and to keep it informed of developments. It requests further that the Government send its observations without delay on the alleged certification (recognition) of trade union elections involving a very small group of dissidents from the union and that it indicates whether the executive committee elected on that occasion has ousted the committee that filed the case under examination; it invites the Government to provide information on any steps taken since November  to follow up the union s request for collective negotiations.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states the following:' with regard to (a), concerning the alleged anti-union dismissal of union leaders Mr Cubilla, Mr Adamson and Mr Aguilar, these persons were not dismissed; instead, each trade union official signed an agreement with the company to terminate the employment relationship by mutual consent (in which they agreed on respective severance pay, and agreed to formally drop any claims, complaints, or legal proceedings against the company, with the company agreeing to do the same vis--vis the workers);' with regard to (b), concerning the alleged dismissal by the company Union International Network GSW of trade unionists who were said to have been involved in the October  protest march, these workers cannot claim unfair dismissal, given that the Higher Labour Court of the First Judicial District of Panama has ruled that the strike held by the National Union of Security Agency Employees (Unin Nacional de Trabajadores de Agencias de Seguridad ' UNTAS) was illegal;' with regard to (c), concerning the alleged failure of Union International Network GSW to pass on union dues to the union, the company indicates that all union dues have been paid and that no money owed to the trade union has been withheld; Union International Network GSW (which later changed its name to GS SA) also signed a collective agreement with UNTAS on  October , valid for four years from that date;' with regard to (d), concerning the alleged violent attack and theft of the belongings of trade unionists exercising their right to protest against Union International Network GSW (which later changed its name to GS SA) ' as mentioned above, mutual agreements were signed with the trade union members, stipulating that they would drop any claims, complaints or legal proceedings which had been lodged previously;' with regard to (e), concerning alleged financial support provided by Union International Network GSW to set up a new trade union, the Community Organizations Directorate is not aware of any parallel trade union existing within the company, with UNTAS being the only affiliated trade union entity;' with regard to (f), concerning other allegations of threatened civil or criminal sanctions against trade unionists who took part in the demonstrations, certification (recognition) of trade union elections involving a very small group of dissidents from the union and the union s request for collective negotiations (the list of demands that had been settled by an agreement concluded in September  was resubmitted in October ), the Government indicates that the Higher Labour Court ruled in favour of the company in its ruling that the UNTAS strike was illegal; the company has also signed agreements with UNTAS trade union officials, in which the parties agree to end the employment relationship by mutual consent, and has issued the respective severance payments and formally dropped any claims, complaints or legal action vis--vis the workers; moreover, having attempted to negotiate a collective agreement with Union International Network GSW in , UNTAS finally signed a collective agreement with the company ' now known as GS SA ' on  October , and valid for four years from that date.
.The Committee takes note of this information, and particularly the fact that the parties to the conflict have signed a new collective agreement.
.The Committee examined the substance of this case at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see st Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session].
.The Government sent observations in communications dated  May  and  March .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case at its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendation on the issues that were still pending [see st Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the union officials Mr Cubilla, Mr Adamson and Mr Aguilar have returned to their posts of work under normal conditions and that it keep the Committee informed in that regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send it: () the judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice in regard to the various measures taken by the Group  Securicor company and the question of whether the workers held a  de facto work stoppage'  () specific information in regard to the alleged anti-union nature of the dozens of dismissals that occurred during the restructuring of the Group  Securicor company with a view, according to the allegations, of weakening the union, as well as any judgement which the courts may have handed down in relation to those dismissals; and () information on whether the trade union organizations affected and the dismissed trade union leaders have instituted additional judicial action.(c) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the relevant legislation in regard to check-off facilities for",-1,2007,Panama
66,"union members' dues is complied with by the company.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to send its specific observations concerning the allegations relating to: () the violent assault on and robbery of trade unionists exercising their right to protest in front of the company by individuals allegedly having received orders from the management to get rid of them, resulting in one worker having to be hospitalized; () the financial support provided by the company for the creation of a trade union; and () the threats of civil and penal sanctions against trade unionists having participated in peaceful demonstrations.(e) The Committee requests the Government to provide clarifications in regard to the alleged certification (recognition) of the trade union elections involving a very small group of dissidents from the union, to whom the company allegedly provided financial support, and to inform it whether the executive committee resulting from those elections has dislodged the one which filed the present case.(f) The Committee invites the Government to provide it with information on any measures taken as from November  to give effect to the union s request for the implementation of collective bargaining.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that it has replied to each of the questions raised by the Committee. It recalls that the allegations refer to: () the transfer of workers under the guise of corporate restructuring, with the intention and effect of weakening the trade union and undermining collective bargaining; () the dismissal and sanctioning of trade unionists who took part in demonstrations to assert their legal rights; () the company s financial, material and legal assistance to criminals who violently attacked and robbed union leaders; () the instigation by the company of an internal dispute within the union and its material support for the emergence of a pro-company faction; and () the use of threats, penal sanctions and civil lawsuits against union members who took part in demonstrations. The Government states that Panama has established trade union rights backed by protective measures and that it actively protects and promotes the trade union movement, without any state interference in its internal affairs, by providing for technical and economic assistance, trade union immunity and penalties for unfair practices.
.Regarding the question of unfair practices, the Government adds that the union is entitled by law to appeal to a criminal court or special labour court to investigate the said measures. The Ministry of Labour and Labour Relations (MITRADEL) is not competent to hear the case and has accordingly followed the procedure laid down in the country s labour legislation and in the ratified international standards. It has complied fully with the law, and there is at present no outstanding dispute between the parties.
.In its communication dated  March  the Government states that UNTAS called a strike at the Group  Securicor company. In ruling No.  of  October , the Third Labour Court decided not to ban the strike, which had halted the company s activities. The Government adds that this ruling was declared null and void, pursuant to article  of the Labour Code which states:A strike may be declared illegal only in one of the following circumstances:
.Regarding the alleged anti-union nature of the dozens of dismissals that followed the protest marches that UNTAS organized from  September  onwards, the Government attaches decision No.  PJCD- handed down by Conciliation and Decision Board No.  on  September , which settled the labour dispute between an employee, Mr Ojier Hernn Serracin, and the company by declaring that his dismissal was unjustified. However, the Higher Labour Tribunal issued a ruling on  September  revoking this decision and acquitting the company of the charge. The Government also attaches decision No. -PJCD-- of  September , confirmed by the court of second instance on  May , to the effect that Mr Luis Velsquez had failed to prove to the competent tribunal that his dismissal was unjustified. In so far as the proper channels were respected, the decision was taken in full jurisdictional independence; in other words, there was no interference by any public institution other that the competent bodies. The Government concludes from the above that the complaint lodged with the Assistant Public Prosecutor shows that it was the workers who used force to take over the company s premises and that there was never any question of trade union persecution but rather of a group of workers acting in violation of established labour standards.
.The Government adds that, according to an investigation conducted by the General Labour Directorate, the union leaders who were dismissed (Mr Cubillas, Mr Adamson and Mr Aguilar) were involved in acts of violence that caused damage to the installations of Union International Network GSW, and that it was because of this that the police responsible for maintaining law and order intervened. The acts of violence were certified by senior police officers (not attached to the Ministry of Labour and Labour Relations) who are responsible only for investigating labour disputes and helping the parties reach a friendly settlement. Under existing legal arrangements, the Ministry is not competent to take action in situations involving violence.
.Regarding the financial support that the company allegedly provided to set up a new trade union, the Government states that it is unaware of any such occurrence. Trade unions have full access to the machinery provided for in article  of the Labour Code to denounce situations such as that described which, if there is sufficient evidence, can be deemed an unfair practice. It must be borne in mind that, in the case of legitimate activities that are carried out in countries governed by laws and regulations, each sphere of activity has a set of established rules and control mechanisms that must not be allowed to disrupt public order, failing which the injured parties are entitled to place the matter before the civil or criminal authorities without any implication that they are opposed to the trade union movement.
.Regarding the deduction of union dues, the Government states that, in Panama, employers are required by law to deduct the ordinary and extraordinary union dues of all members of trade unions, with the sole condition that each worker be duly accredited (article  of the Labour Code). Article  further requires companies to deduct the union dues of all their workers who are covered by a collective agreement.
.The Government adds that it is the police authorities and the Public Prosecutor who are responsible for preventing violence and theft and that the Government is not competent to take action in this area. The Government s mission is to serve as a body that can oversee unions' actions and it does not interfere in their functioning or activities, in accordance with the principle of freedom of association.
.Lastly, the Government states that the National Assembly has, in third hearing, approved draft Act No.   which incorporates new provisions concerning the duties of employers into the Labour Code which are designed to promote protective measures for security agents' 
.The Committee observes that the complaint concerns: () allegations relating to the dismissal of dozens of workers at the Group  Securicor company following peaceful protests in October , even before the judicial authority had ruled on the lawfulness or otherwise of the action (the judicial authority considered there to have been a  de facto work stoppage'  but the Supreme Court of Justice currently has before it an appeal against that decision); ()(a) allegations relating to the year  to the effect that the company had ordered two of its workers to attack demonstrating trade unionists who were occupying its premises in the early morning of  February , with the aim of forcing them to leave the company s property; according to the complainant union, eight assailants (two of whom were arrested and subsequently released) seized money and belongings from the trade unionists; one of the assailants threatened them with a firearm, while one of the trade unionists was beaten and had to be hospitalized; (b) financial support provided by the company to a very small group of dissidents within the union who organized so-called elections that were certified by the Government; and (c) the failure (on the part of the company) to hand over trade union dues to the union. The Committee takes note of the Government s broad observation that the country s legislation guarantees trade union rights, including trade union immunity, and provides for sanctions in respect of unfair practices.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that: () the Higher Labour Tribunal ruled on  October  that the strike called by UNTAS was unlawful; () according to the complaint lodged with the Assistant Public Prosecutor, it was the workers who used force to take over the company s premises, and there was never any question of trade union persecution; () according to an investigation conducted by the General Labour Directorate, the union leaders who were dismissed (Mr",-1,2007,Panama
67,"Cubillas, Mr Adamson and Mr Aguilar) took part in violent activities that damaged the enterprise installations and it was because of this that the police responsible for maintaining law and order intervened; () it is not aware of any element relating to the company s alleged financial support for setting up a new trade union; and () in Panama employers are required by law to deduct the ordinary and extraordinary union dues of all members of trade unions, with the sole condition that each worker be duly accredited.
.Regarding the alleged anti-union dismissal of union leaders Mr Cubilla, Mr Adamson and Mr Aguilar, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these workers were involved in acts of violence that caused damage to the enterprise installations, which was why the police responsible for maintaining law and order intervened. The acts of violence were certified by senior police officers and by the labour administration (which is responsible only for investigating labour disputes and helping the parties reach a friendly settlement). The Committee recalls that, in its previous examination of the case, it observed that according to the allegations the judicial authority did not accede to the company s request for a suspension of the trade union immunity of union officials Cubilla, Adamson and Aguilar, and that the Committee therefore requested the Government to ensure that they had been able to return to their posts of work under normal conditions. Noting the Government s assertion that the situation has changed inasmuch as the demonstration was an act of violence and not a peaceful protest, the Committee requests the Government to inform it without delay of the current status of these workers and, specifically, whether their trade union immunity has since been suspended and whether any proceedings have been initiated in connection with what the Government describes as an act of violence against the enterprise installations. In the case that it is found that the dismissal was illegal, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation that the Government ensure that they have been able to return to their posts of work under normal conditions and that it keep it informed of developments.
.Regarding the alleged dismissal (as part of a corporate restructuring) of dozens of other trade unionists said to have been involved in the October  protest march, the Committee takes note of Decision No.  PJCD- of  September  and Decision No. -PJCD-- of  September , confirmed in second instance on  May , to the effect that two of the plaintiffs had failed to prove to the competent tribunal that their dismissal was unjustified. However, the Committee notes that the Government does not provide any information as to whether the trade unions concerned or the union members themselves have initiated any further court action, and it can therefore not determine whether or not all the remaining dismissals were considered to have been justified. The Committee requests the Government to provide it with information on the subject without delay, together with copies of the court decisions handed down.
.Regarding the alleged unlawfulness of the strike called by UNTAS and the anti-union nature of the dismissals that occurred during the corporate restructuring, supposedly to weaken the trade union, the Committee takes note of the Higher Labour Tribunal s ruling of  October  that the strike called by UNTAS was unlawful notably because the union had not followed the legal procedures in force, i.e. the requirements stipulated in article  of the Labour Code, notably the completion of the proceedings engaged and the advance notification of the regional or general labour inspectorate or directorate.
.Regarding the company s alleged failure to pass on union dues due to the union and to comply with the legislative provisions on the subject, the Committee notes the Government s statement that employers in Panama are required by law to deduct the ordinary and extraordinary union dues of all members of trade unions, with the sole condition that each worker be duly accredited. The Committee requests that the Government inform it whether the company has deducted any union dues that have not been credited to the trade union concerned and, if so, to ensure without delay that this is done.
.Regarding the alleged violent attack on trade unionists and the theft of their belongings by individuals who had received orders from the management to remove them from the premises, where they were exercising their right to protest against the company, the Committee notes that it is the police authorities and the Public Prosecutor who are responsible for preventing violence and theft and that the union is entitled by law to lodge an appeal with a criminal court. The Committee requests the Government and the complainant organizations to indicate whether there has been any investigation into the matter or if the victims have lodged any judicial appeals and to keep it informed of developments.
.Regarding the alleged financial support provided by the company for setting up a new trade union, the Committee notes the Government s statement that it is unaware of any such occurrence and its reliance on the country s laws and regulations. The Committee requests the Government to institute an inquiry into the allegations and to keep it informed accordingly.
.Regarding the other allegations ' threatened civil or criminal sanctions against trade unionists who took part in the demonstrations, certification (recognition) of trade union elections involving a very small group of dissidents from the union and the union s request for collective negotiations (the list of demands that had been settled by an agreement concluded in September  was resubmitted in October ), the Committee regrets to note that the Government has not provided any information on the subject. The Committee requests the Government to institute an inquiry without delay into the alleged threats of civil and criminal sanctions against trade unionists who took part in the demonstrations and to keep it informed of developments. It requests further that the Government send its observations without delay on the alleged certification (recognition) of trade union elections involving a very small group of dissidents from the union and indicate whether the executive committee elected on that occasion has dislodged the committee that filed the case under examination; it requests the Government to provide information on any steps taken since November  to follow up the union s request for collective negotiations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Regarding the alleged anti-union dismissal of union leaders Mr Cubilla, Mr Adamson and Mr Aguilar, the Committee recalls that, in its previous examination of the case, it observed that according to the allegations the judicial authority did not accede to the company s request for a suspension of their trade union immunity, and that the Committee therefore requested the Government to ensure that they had been able to return to their posts of work.

.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Union of Security Agency Employees (UNTAS) and Union Network International (UNI) dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  December  and  May .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that the complaint relates to: () allegations relating to the year  and concerning the unlawful transfer, within the context of corporate restructuring, of  workers belonging to the Group  Securicor company a matter of days before collective bargaining was due to begin with the complainant union, the UNTAS, with the loss of a number of acquired rights; and the dismissal of dozens of workers following peaceful protests in October , even before the judicial authority had ruled on the lawfulness or otherwise of the action (the judicial authority considered there to have been a  de facto work stoppage'  but the Supreme Court of Justice currently has before it an appeal against that decision); ()(a) allegations relating to the year  to the effect that the company had ordered two of its workers to attack demonstrating trade unionists, at  a.m. on  February , with the aim of forcing them to leave the company s property; according to the complainant union, there were eight assailants (two of whom were arrested and subsequently released) who seized money and belongings from the trade unionists, who were also threatened with a firearm by one of the assailants; one of the trade unionists was beaten and had to be hospitalized; (b) financial support provided by the company to a very small group of dissidents within the union who organized so-called elections which were certified by the Government; and (c) the failure (on the part of the company) to hand over to the union the trade union dues.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s extensive reply containing numerous extracts from the legislation in force but which does not, however, provide sufficient clarifications on the majority of the allegations.
.As regards the alleged transfer of  workers with the loss of a number of acquired rights in August , prior to the commencement of negotiations with the company on the restructuring, the Committee notes the Government s information that the parties came to an agreement on  September  whereby the strike was ended and the UNTAS union withdrew its list of complaints. The Committee has no information as to whether ' or not, as the complainant organizations allege ' the aforementioned August  transfers were preceded by consultations or negotiations. However, inasmuch as the parties came to an agreement in September  whereby the strike was ended, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.As regards the allegations concerning the dismissal of dozens of workers following peaceful protests organized by the UNTAS as from  September , with a slowdown in the pace of work, the Committee observes that according to the allegations the judicial authority did not accede to the company s request for a suspension of the trade union immunity of the union officials Mr Cubilla, Mr Adamson and Mr Aguilar, and that the company allegedly prevented those officials from working their shifts. The Committee has received no observations from the Government in respect of these three officials, other than a reference to the legal provisions governing trade union immunity (which facilitate the submission of judicial complaints); it requests the Government to ensure that they have been able to return to their posts of work under normal conditions and that it keep the Committee informed in that regard. As regards the other dismissals of trade unionists allegedly associated with the aforementioned peaceful protest, the Committee observes that the Government confines itself to stating that the matter of the dismissals falls within the sole competence of the Ministry of Labour, that the legislation provides for measures designed to protect trade union immunity against unfair practices and dismissals which alter the proportion of unionized workers (section () of the Labour Code), and that the union was entitled to file judicial complaints. The Committee requests the Government to provide it with a copy, as soon as it is handed down, of the judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice, as referred to by the complainant organizations, in regard to the various measures taken by the company and the question of whether the workers held a  de facto work stoppage'  and that the Government provide it with specific information in regard to the alleged anti-union nature of the dozens of dismissals that occurred during the restructuring, affecting (judging by the allegations) a large number of trade unionists and thereby weakening the union, and that it likewise provide it with any judgement which the courts may have handed down in relation to those dismissals. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the alleged failure by the company to hand over to the union the dues paid by its members (allegations relating to ), the Committee notes that the Government makes no specific reference to this matter but mentions legal provisions relating to the right to organize and to the registration and dissolution of trade unions. The Committee requests the Government to provide it with detailed information on the aforementioned allegation and to ensure that the relevant legislation in regard to check-off facilities for union members' dues is complied with by the company.
.As regards the other matters, namely the alleged: () violent assault on and robbery of trade unionists exercising their right to protest, by individuals having received orders from the company management to get rid of them, resulting in one worker having to be hospitalized; () financial support from the company for the creation of a trade union; and () threats of civil and penal sanctions against trade unionists having participated in peaceful demonstrations, the Committee observes that the Government once again confines itself to stating that these are issues falling solely within the competence of the Ministry of Labour, that the legislation provides for measures for affording protection against unfair practices and acts of interference on the part of employers, and that the union had the right to file judicial complaints. The Committee requests the Government to send it specific information on these allegations, which in and of themselves would have called for an investigation on the part of the labour inspectorate, and, in the hope that it will receive such detailed information without delay, requests the Government to take the necessary steps to transmit it. The Committee points out that the complainant organizations refer to the unlawful certification (recognition) of the trade union elections conducted by a very small group of dissidents, and to the granting by the company of financial support to nine of them. Thus, in the absence of specific information from the Government in that regard, it is not known whether the union s new executive committee has dislodged the one which submitted the complaint to the Committee. The Committee requests the Government to provide it with clarification in that respect. Moreover, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the trade union organizations affected and the dismissed trade union leaders have instituted additional judicial action.
.As regards the request by the complainant organizations for the union to be able to participate in a constructive and comprehensive dialogue with the company, the Committee has already taken note of the Government s explanations regarding the series of claims filed by the UNTAS union on  June , and",-1,2007,Panama
69,"of the withdrawal of those claims on  September  by common agreement of the parties (the company and the union); it also notes that, according to the Government, the Ministry of Labour had previously, in June, rejected those claims in accordance with the legislation, since a collective agreement was in force. The Committee observes that the Government states that on  October  the series of claims was resubmitted and that the Ministry of Labour refused to receive it on account of doubts as to the authenticity of the signatures and of its having been submitted on  October , only minutes after the union having been informed that its request of  September  could not be processed. The Committee invites the Government to provide it with information on any measures taken as from November  to give effect to the union s request for the implementation of collective bargaining.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the union officials Mr Cubilla, Mr Adamson and Mr Aguilar have returned to their posts of work under normal conditions and that it keep the Committee informed in that regard.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to send it: () the judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice in regard to the various measures taken by the Group  Securicor company and the question of whether the workers held a  de facto work stoppage'  () specific information in regard to the alleged anti-union nature of the dozens of dismissals that occurred during the restructuring of the Group  Securicor company with a view, according to the allegations, of weakening the union, as well as any judgement which the courts may have handed down in relation to those dismissals; and () information on whether the trade union organizations affected and the dismissed trade union leaders have instituted additional judicial action.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the relevant legislation in regard to check-off facilities for union members' dues is complied with by the company.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to send its specific observations concerning the allegations relating to: () the violent assault on and robbery of trade unionists exercising their right to protest in front of the company by individuals allegedly having received orders from the management to get rid of them, resulting in one worker having to be hospitalized; () the financial support provided by the company for the creation of a trade union; and () the threats of civil and penal sanctions against trade unionists having participated in peaceful demonstrations.(e)	The Committee requests the Government to provide clarifications in regard to the alleged certification (recognition) of the trade union elections involving a very small group of dissidents from the union, to whom the company allegedly provided financial support, and to inform it whether the executive committee resulting from those elections has dislodged the one which filed the present case.(f)	The Committee invites the Government to provide it with information on any measures taken as from November  to give effect to the union s request for the implementation of collective bargaining.",1,2007,Panama
70,".At its meeting in June , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:' The Committee requests the Government to examine, in conjunction with the complainant federation, the situation regarding the Secretary-General of the Association (which is in the process of being established) of Officials of the Interoceanic Regional Authority (AFARI), Ms Vidalia Quiroz, who contrary to the other reinstated union leaders, is receiving, according to the allegations, a lower salary in the new institution to which she has been reassigned than she earned previously. The Committee requests the Government to ameliorate, correct and resolve the situation if it finds that anti-union discrimination occurred. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this respect.' The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the leaders of the AFARI have been paid the salaries and other benefits due to them and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.In its communication of  November , the National Federation of Public Employees and Public Service Enterprise Workers (FENASEP) rejects the previous statements made by the Government and indicates that Act No.  on administrative careers provides that the leaders of legally-recognized associations of public officials  cannot be subject to reductions in the Government labour force' and that the salaries owed to the union leaders, as agreed with FENASEP, have not been paid in full.
.In its communication of  October , the Government reiterates that the alleged dismissals of public officials were a result of the Interoceanic Regional Authority ceasing to exist, which meant that contracts were terminated on  December  and replaced by temporary contracts at the Ministry of Economy and Finance from  January . The Government adds that it does not owe any legal benefits to the former public officials. The trade union leaders are not entitled to the th-month payment of December  as they only worked until  July . The former public officials ' including trade union leaders such as Ms Vidalia Quiroz ' were recruited to work for one year in the Social Investment Fund. The Government indicates that, after being consulted about the difference in salary with regard to her previous post, Ms Vidalia Quiroz accepted her post and new functions as at that time there was no similar position with the same salary as the one she received at the Interoceanic Regional Authority. The Government reiterates that salaries and benefits have been paid in full.

.In light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the contested Decree No. , which regulates work at sea and on waterways, noting that the Government does not deny the allegation that this Decree obstructs the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to amend section  of the Decree and to promote the full development and use of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' and workers' organizations of the sector, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment through collective agreements. The Committee requests the Government to hold proper consultations with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of any ruling handed down by the Supreme Court on the unconstitutionality of various sections of Decree No. , as well as on any new bill on the maritime sector presented to the Legislative Assembly.(b) As to the dismissal in April  of the General Secretary of the Panamanian Trade Union of Maritime Tugging, Barges and Related Services (SITRASERMAP), Mr. Luis Fruto, at the enterprise Smit Harbour Towage Panama, the Committee regrets the long time that has lapsed since the beginning of the court case (April ) relating to the dismissal, trusts that the Supreme Court of Justice will soon hand down a ruling on the matter, taking into account the fact that the Ministry of Labour had ordered the reinstatement of this trade union leader in his post, the Committee requests the Government, if it is confirmed that the dismissal of this union official was due to his trade union activities, to take the necessary measures to ensure that he is reinstated in his post without delay with the payment of the wages owed to him and any other legal entitlements.

.In its communication of  April , the National Federation of Public Employees and Public Service Enterprise Workers (FENASEP) states that, of the  dismissed union officials, ten remain to be reinstated and none have been paid the wages owed to them.
.In its communications dated  and  May , the Government states that trade union official Mr Pedro Alan has been reinstated as part of the current government policy to observe the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and that it issued a decision to that effect on  January . With regard to the  dismissed officials of the Ministry of Social Development (formerly known as the Ministry of Youth, Women, Children and Family), the Government states that some have been reinstated by the current Administration and that only ten have yet to be reinstated. The Government indicates that it has not yet been able to reinstate these ten officials for budgetary reasons and that the necessary financial measures are being taken. The Government states that it will do its utmost to comply, gradually and as far as possible, with the Committee s recommendations.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government informs that the ten remaining trade union leaders have been reinstated in the Ministry for Social Development or in other public institutions.
.The Committee notes this information with satisfaction. The Committee requests the Government to ensure payment of outstanding wages in accordance with the law.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras. -], at which it formulated the following recommendations:(a) As regards the dismissal in August  of  union officials of the Association of Employees of the Ministry of Youth, Women, Children and the Family, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that all the union officials in question are reinstated in their posts, and to keep it informed of developments and of any agreements reached by the bipartite commission.(b) As regards the payment of wage arrears of the union officials in question, the Committee hopes that this issue will be resolved without delay in the framework of the negotiations that are taking place in the bipartite commission.(c) As regards the dismissal on  January  of Mr. Pedro Alain, a member of the Executive Committee of the Association of Public Servants of the Ministry of Education, the Committee requests the Government promptly to conduct an investigation and, if the dismissal is found to have been antiunion in nature, to reinstate Mr. Alain without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.
.In a communication dated  April , the National Federation of Associations and Organizations of Public Servants (FENASEP) states that the present Government or, failing that, the authorities of the  institutions involved, have ignored the Committee s recommendations concerning the reinstatement and payment of the wage arrears of the officials of the associations who were dismissed without cause by the previous administration, merely for belonging to a different political party, in violation of their immunity as public sector union officials. To date, there has been no recognition of their entitlement to the wages unpaid since their dismissal, and they have been unable to obtain employment in any state institution. FENASEP adds that, in January , the Ministry of Labour and Employment Development sent letters to the different authorities of the institutions concerned, saying that the officials should be once again  considered for a post within the institution' in question, but the authorities of these institutions have ignored this request. In this regard, the Ministry of Labour should have set an example and reinstated three officials, but this has not been done either.
.In a communication of  September , the Government states that, through the Ministry s efforts and in order to try to give effect to the Committee s recommendations in this case, the Bipartite Committee consisting of FENASEP and MITRADEL has continued to meet to seek appropriate means of reinstating, as far as possible, the officials of the Association of Employees of the Ministry of Youth, Women, Children and the Family (now renamed the  Ministry of Social Development ' MIDES'  dismissed by the previous administration. As a result of these efforts, the Government has recently received information from MIDES, in a note of  August , indicating that Ms. Melissa Fergusson is in the process of being reinstated in that Ministry, pending final verifications in the Ministry of the Economy and Finance. As regards the rest of the members of the Association, the Government points out that MIDES is taking appropriate steps to reinstate, as far as possible, the dismissed officials referred to in this case.

The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In its communication dated  April , the National Federation of Associations and Organizations of Public Servants (FENASEP) states that, of the  trade union officials who were illegally and unjustly dismissed from  state institutions by the previous administration,  have yet to be reinstated as the institutions in question have ignored the recommendations regarding reinstatement and the payment of outstanding wages made by the FENASEP Ministry of Labour and Social Development bipartite committee. One trade union official, Raquel Bedoya (of the Association of the Ministry of Housing), has died. FENASEP adds that the National Institute of Culture has appointed trade union official Eric Justanino and that the National Institute of Professional Development and Training (INADEH) believes that former trade union official, Ms Mariana de Hall, does not have the profile required to work in that institution because reports show serious misconduct: acts of aggression, arguments and disorderliness within the institution, a high percentage of absences, lateness, etc.
.In its communications dated ,  and  May , the Government states that two trade union officials, Messrs Carlos Chial and Gustavo Jaime, have been appointed by INADEH and confirms the information from FENASEP regarding Ms Mariana de Hall. The Government states that the bipartite committee with the complainant organization has continued to meet and has recommended that the institutions where the dismissed trade union officials used to work reinstate them as permanent staff. The Government sends a list of the trade union officials who were dismissed and the public institutions where they used to work from which it can be concluded, as stated by FENASEP, that  of the trade union officials have not been reinstated. The Government states that it has not yet been possible to reinstate these trade union officials due to budgetary reasons and that the necessary financial management is in progress. The Government states that it will make every effort to comply with the Committee s recommendations gradually and to the extent possible. The Government highlights that the current policy of the Government is to respect the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government and FENASEP. The Committee observes that since the previous examination of the case, seven more trade union officials have been reinstated, leaving  that have not been reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to continue its efforts to obtain the reinstatement of these trade union officials and the payment of their outstanding wages and to keep it informed in this regard.
.At its June  Session, the Committee made the following recommendations regarding the issues pending (the dismissal of  trade unionists for party political reasons following the  elections, and the trial of a trade union official) [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee is still awaiting the ruling in the criminal proceedings against Alberto Ibarra for offences against honour. At the same time, the Committee notes with interest the Government s indication that it has established a joint commission with the National Federation of Associations and Organizations of Public Servants (FENASEP) to seek, through dialogue and consultation, solutions to problems raised by that organization and that the commission studies the possibility to resolve the pending questions through negotiation. The Committee recalls that on previous occasions, it had requested the Government to examine, with the FENASEP, the possibility of offering new posts to the union officers (whose status as union officers must be duly accredited) dismissed for political reasons in September . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In its communication dated  April , the FENASEP states that the current Government or, where not the Government, the authorities governing the  institutions involved, have ignored the Committee s recommendations regarding the reinstatement of and payment of outstanding wages to the officials of the associations concerned, who were dismissed by the previous administration without grounds, simply for belonging to another political party, thereby breaking the law and infringing their trade union rights as public sector trade union officials. the FENASEP claims that the Ministry of Labour itself should set the example by reinstating three officials, but has not done so. the FENASEP states that a group of trade union officials who were reinstated have still not been paid the wages outstanding since their dismissal.
.In its communications of  August and  September , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Development has continued to meet with the FENASEP in the joint committee set up to examine how to implement the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association. Despite the economic and administrative difficulty for the government institutions to appoint the dismissed officials, the Government has, to the best of its abilities, managed to reinstate some of them, thanks to discussions in the joint committee. The Government cites the reinstatement of Jessica del Carmen Bloise, Mayre Bustamante and Melissa Fergunson. As to other officials, the Government states that only about  of the  officials dismissed by the former administration were still waiting to be reinstated. Since many of the governmental institutions do not have the vacancies necessary for the dismissed officials to be reinstated in their posts (such as Jos Alba, Carlos Chial and Jos Hurtado, whose reinstatement the Panama Maritime Authority (AMP) says is not possible at the moment), these will be taken into consideration when the possibility of a post arises. The Government concludes that it will continue to report on the reinstatement of the remaining workers as and when their situation is resolved.
.The Committee notes this information and expresses the hope that the  trade union officials not yet reinstated in their posts, will be reinstated in the near future and that the wages owed to them will be paid, and requests the Government to continue to take measures to this end. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The issues pending in the present case refer mainly to the allegations of dismissal of trade union officials in the context of mass dismissals of public servants for partisan political reasons, which affected thousands of public servants since the new Government took over (September ) [see th Report, para. ]. The Committee made the following recommendations at its March  meeting [see th Report, para. ]:' the Committee requests the Government to examine the possibility of offering new posts to the union officers dismissed, on the understanding that it is for the complainant to demonstrate the status of the  persons concerned as union officers. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect;' the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the ruling given in the criminal trial of the union officer Alberto Ibarra for offences against honour.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states, with regard to the  persons mentioned by the complainant organization as being trade union officials, that in the documents submitted it has not noted that any of these are accredited as trade union officials. The complainant organization has also not provided proof to uphold this allegation, as requested by the Committee. With regard to the information requested on the ruling given in the criminal trial of Alberto Ibarra, the Government states that the hearing set for April  was held but that the decision relating to this is pending.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the ruling in the criminal trial of the union officer Alberto Ibarra for offences against honour, when this is handed down.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in March  and presented a provisional report [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (March )].
.The National Federation of Associations and Organizations of Public Servants (FENASEP) sent additional information in a communication dated  May . The Government replied in a communication dated  September .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of  union officers, the Committee takes note that, according to new allegations from the complainant,  further dismissals of union officers have taken place. The Committee takes note of the Government s statements concerning the dismissal of  union officers, in particular that: ()",1,2001,Panama
74,"the figure of  union officers is at odds with reality and the complainant has not accredited their status as union officers; () the people in question had not legally entered the permanent appointments system; () the dismissals were carried out legally and in accordance with due process and the majority of the interested parties went through review and appeals procedures on which rulings have been given; () having complied with legislation, the authorities cannot legally reinstate any of the  people in their posts. The Committee also notes that, according to the complainant, the judicial authorities have ruled on only  cases (a total of  cases in which reinstatement was requested).
.The Committee refers to its previous conclusions in the present case regarding the allegations of dismissal of union officers in the context of mass dismissals of public servants for partisan political reasons, which have affected thousands of public servants since the new Government took over (September ). The Committee drew attention to the danger of unfairness inherent in mass dismissals of public servants [see th Report, para. ] and concentrated its recommendations on the  union officers. The Committee notes that the Government in its reply claims that the  officers had benefited from due administrative process, that the complainant has reported that the judicial processes relating to  public servants have not been concluded, and that  further union officers have been dismissed. The Government objects to the classification of so many of the  people in question as  union officers'  but has not indicated whether legal proceedings are under way in this respect. For its part, the Committee cannot exclude the possibility of some or all of the dismissals being related to the exercise of union rights, even in the context of mass dismissals of public servants.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to examine the possibility of offering new posts to the union officers dismissed. Given that the Government and the complainant disagree about the union officer status applied to the  people dismissed ( in the first instance and a further  subsequently), the Committee emphasizes that it is to the complainant to demonstrate their status as union officers during such negotiations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Lastly, with regard to the criminal trial of the union officer Mr. Alberto Ibarra for offences against honour (section  of the Judicial Code) against three public servants at INAC, the Committee notes that Mr. Ibarra has been summoned to appear in court and a judicial hearing is due to take place in April . The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the ruling.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to examine the possibility of offering new posts to the union officers dismissed, on the understanding that it is for the complainant to demonstrate the status of the  persons concerned as union officers. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the ruling given in the criminal trial of the union officer, Mr. Alberto Ibarra, for offences against honour.
.The National Federation of Associations and Organizations of Public Servants (FENASEP) presented the complaint in a communication dated  May . The organization sent additional information in a communication dated  July . Public Services International (PSI) supported FENASEP s complaint in a communication dated  June . The Government replied in a communication dated  October .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  May and  July , the National Federation of Associations and Organizations of Public Servants (FENASEP) alleges that, since  September  (when the new President of the Republic came to power), the Government, for partisan political reasons, has dismissed , public servants and excluded a further , from permanent appointments. FENASEP adds that it took a number of actions as a trade union and the Government decided to dismiss trade union leaders of associations of public employees (a list of  dismissed public servants was annexed).
.FENASEP challenged the Government s actions by contesting the constitutionality of resolution No.  dated  October , but it was not declared unconstitutional because it had been rescinded. No administrative or judicial organ pronounced itself in favour of the trade union leaders.
.FENASEP criticized the Government s refusal to negotiate with it at the bipartite level (it has been able to participate in discussions only as a part of the National Council of Unionized Workers (CONATO)) and refers in general terms to measures to prevent union leaders acting freely, limit their actions or prevent protests.
.FENASEP alleges that acts have been committed against its Secretary-General (threats of dismissal and discussion for the purpose of the continuation of unpaid leave), though the individual concerned withdrew the allegations after experiencing an improvement in the situation and enjoying ""full freedom of association"", according to a communication signed by him on  October .
.Finally, FENASEP encloses a copy of the ruling against Mr. Alberto Ibarra, a member of the FENASEP executive committee, for offences against honour (slander and insults) committed against representatives of the public administration (INAC) in public statements made by Mr. Ibarra on  October , which implied that the INAC, through its representatives, had committed unlawful acts.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that not all public servants are part of the permanent appointments system. It does not include those appointed by public election, free nomination and transfer, nomination under the Constitution and selection, as well as those still in the probationary period, those in office and some contingencies.
.Under Law No. , article , free nomination and transfer applies to public servants ""who provide secretarial, consulting, assistance or other services directly in the service of public servants, who are not part of any permanent appointments system and, by the nature of their functions, are appointed on the basis of the confidence of their superiors, the loss of that confidence entailing the transfer of the post that they occupy"".
.Article  adds that public servants in office ""are those who, at the entry into force of this Act and its provisions, occupied a public post classified as permanent, until such time as they obtain, through the established procedures, the status of permanently appointed public servants, or are discharged from public service"".
.Moreover, articles  and  of Executive Decree No.  establish the requirements for a public servant to be included in the permanent appointments system (assessment of past achievements demonstrating fulfilment of the minimum post requirements according to the Post Classification Manual, minimum education qualifications and required length of service in the post).
.In compliance with Executive Decree No. , article , the Directorate-General of Appointments has produced a Post Classification Manual laying down the minimum requirements for accreditation as a permanently appointed public servant.
.A permanently appointed public servant is a public servant with security of tenure, who may not be dismissed without just cause and application of the established procedures, as laid down by Executive Decree No. , article .
.The Post Classification Manual and the provisions governing access to the permanent appointments system have been applied in a formal and effective manner since Mr. Mireya Moscoso was elected to the post of President on  May . For this reason, the outgoing Government took steps during the transition period from May to  August  to appoint public servants in indiscriminate, arbitrary and unlawful manner, without fulfilling the necessary procedures.
.This situation affected in particular the performance of governmental bodies, leading to a loss of confidence and damaging the credibility of the procedure used in the permanent appointments system.
.Between June  and the general elections on  May , a total of , public servants had been accredited, while a further , were accredited in the transition period from June to August  before the new Government took over. It is clear from this that in the latter case, the procedures were not properly observed.
.Consequently, the Government took responsible steps to correct the situation in order to ensure that the newly accredited public servants met the minimum requirements contained in the relevant legal provisions.
.It thus issued resolution No.  dated  October , temporarily suspending access to permanent appointments, and ordered an overhaul of the system. It transpired that a large proportion of accreditations had been made wrongfully.
.Following investigations and measures to clean up the system, the Government issued resolution No.  dated  July , which rendered null and void the decision adopted in resolution No.  to the effect that public servants who met the minimum requirements could be accredited as permanently appointed public servants.
.The only people excluded from permanent appointments were those who had obtained them",1,2001,Panama
75,"unlawfully, thus undermining their colleagues' credibility and rights. However, the removal of their accreditation does not imply their dismissal (many public servants whose permanent accreditation was removed continued to work in the government departments).
.Where public servants wish to take action in cases of dismissal, removal of accreditation or disciplinary sanctions, the law grants them access to review and appeal procedures and, where the outcome is unfavourable, they may, as a last resort, appeal to the high court. All government departments have taken care to follow this procedure properly, and there have been many rulings in favour of public servants who have appealed. The Government has provided a long list of the relevant decisions.
.The Government of Panama has made every effort to allow FENASEP to participate in cooperation and social dialogue, notably in the agreement on public transport in the metropolitan area.
.As regards FENASEP s activities, the Government states that, in accordance with the basic guarantees established by the Constitution, including freedom of assembly and freedom of expression and association, it has always allowed protests in the form of marches and pickets in all industries, believing that such activities where conducted with full respect for the law and the rights of third parties and contribute to strengthening national democracy.
.The Government emphasizes that it has not carried out unlawful dismissals of leaders of public servants' associations and has complied with Conventions Nos.  and .
.In resolution No.  dated  October , the Cabinet Council granted the Directorate-General of Appointments the powers to revise the records of accredited public servants in order to ensure that they met the current legal criteria of the permanent appointments system, identifying cases that fall short, particularly where the appointment was made in the transition period between Governments.
.The Government has had ongoing communication with FENASEP, ensuring its involvement in government activities (reports have been sent of meetings of the Secretary-General of FENASEP with the Minister for Labour, the Vice-Minister for Labour and the Vice-President of the Republic). Likewise, the Secretary-General of FENASEP was encouraged to participate in the national tripartite delegation to the th Session of the International Labour Conference. FENASEP was also a party to the negotiations on public transport: it has been present at periodic meetings of CONATO and the Ministry of Labour and Development; and it has received very significant State subsidies (US$, for the period -) through the educational insurance fund.
.According to the Government, FENASEP also refers to the communication by the State with teachers' and other public servants' organizations, which demonstrates clearly that the Government has striven to uphold social accord and good governance by maintaining open channels of communication with all social organizations and public servants' associations, as well as with FENASEP, which is not the only public servants' organization in Panama.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that  trade union leaders have been dismissed in the context of the mass dismissal of thousands of public servants for partisan political reasons following the change of government in September .
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements to the effect that: () the outgoing Government had improperly granted permanent appointments to , public servants during the transition period; () it had therefore issued resolution No.  dated  October , temporarily suspending access to permanent appointments, and ordered an overhaul of the system; once that had been attained, it then issued resolution No.  dated  July , which rendered null and void the decision adopted in resolution No.  to the effect that public servants who met the minimum requirements could be accredited as permanently appointed public servants; () those subjected to dismissal or ""removal of accreditation"" (i.e. whose permanent appointment was cancelled even though they remained in their posts) had remedies at their disposal and many had obtained rulings in their favour; and () the Government had needed to take corrective action in order to ensure that those who were accredited met the minimum legal requirements (length of service, educational qualifications, etc.) and in fact it had transpired that a large number of accreditations had been made improperly.
.Although it has taken note of the Government s statements, the Committee must draw attention to the danger of unfairness inherent in mass dismissals of public servants and regrets that  trade union leaders have been dismissed without any preliminary procedures being followed, which is contrary to the provisions of section  of Decree No.  which requires that a dismissal be done on fair motives, that a preliminary procedure is respected and that a rapid investigation be undertaken with the possibility for the dismissed worker to defend himself. Given the serious impact of these decisions on the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee requests the Government to promote the reinstatement of the trade union leaders in their posts inasmuch as they meet the legal requirements for permanent appointment and inform it of procedures undertaken since the dismissals.
.The Committee also notes that the Government denies having refused to enter into dialogue, negotiate or take steps to prevent trade union activities, or measures against FENASEP. The Committee notes that the allegations were made in very general terms and therefore it is not in a position to examine them more thoroughly.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations relating to the criminal charges against the trade union leader, Mr. Alberto Ibarra.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to promote the reinstatement in their posts of the  trade union leaders dismissed without any preliminary procedures inasmuch as they meet the legal requirements for permanent appointment and inform it of procedures undertaken since the dismissals.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations relating to the criminal charges against the trade union leader Mr. Alberto Ibarra.",0,2001,Panama
76,".At its meeting in November , the Committee noted ""with satisfaction the information provided by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in its communication of  October , according to which the affiliation of FENASEP to the Joint Trade Union Central has been registered by a decision of the Minister of Labour and Social Development"".
.In its communication of  February , the Government, referring to the registration of FENASEP, states that the previous Minster of Labour on his final day in office acted in a way that flew in the face of legal judgement by formally recognizing the affiliation of FENASEP to the Joint Trade Union Central; this created a legal quandary for the incoming Government, since the official decision in question was signed by persons not competent to do so and violated constitutional and legal provisions in force, making it necessary to issue a new decision overruling the original one. The Government adds that registration of FENASEP as being affiliated to the Joint Trade Union Central would be against FENASEP by-laws. Following a long legal clarification, the Government adds that FENASEP could hardly comply with the National Constitution (the Carta Magna), the Labour Code and the Act respecting the administrative service, by affiliating to the Joint Trade Union Central, an act which would constitute a total violation of all three. At the same time, under the terms of article  of the Constitution of Panama, public servants may do only that which the law specifically empowers them to do and are liable for any acts exceeding their powers or for any omissions in carrying out their duties. Ministry of Labour officials could therefore not recognize and register the affiliation of a public service union to a private sector trade union organization without breaking the law, which is absolutely clear that this is the sole responsibility of the Directorate of the Administrative Service (Direccin de Carrera Administrativa) and specifically in the case of public service federations and confederations.
.The Committee deeply deplores the administrative decision overruling the original decision to register FENASEP as being affiliated to the Joint Trade Union Central, and recalls the Government's international obligations arising from ratification of Convention No. , in particular Article , according to which ""Workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to establish and join federations and confederations and any such organisation, federation or confederation shall have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers and employers."" The Committee requests the Government to recognize and re-register the affiliation of FENASEP to the Joint Trade Union Central organization without delay and to keep it informed on this matter.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), dated  May . The Government sent observations in a letter of  October .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that, in the present complaint, the complainant organization alleges that the authorities refuse to recognize the affiliation of the National Federation of Associations and Organizations of Public Servants (FENASEP) to the Joint Trade Union Central, pursuant to Ministry of Labour resolution No. -DOS- of  July (endorsed by the resolution issued by the Senior Authorities on  May ).
.The Committee also notes the Government's statement that public servants and employees may organize themselves in associations for the protection and defence of their members' interests (though not as trade unions, other than in certain cases explicitly provided for by legislation). According to the Government, public servants' associations enjoy the basic rights established by ILO Conventions Nos.  and , including the right to bargain collectively and to take strike action. Nevertheless, the Government indicates that public servants are governed by the law applicable to careers in the public administration and not by the Labour Code; on legal grounds, it is impossible for FENASEP to become affiliated to the Joint Trade Union Central. Moreover, in the Government's opinion, Article  of Convention No.  (""this Convention does not deal with the position of public servants engaged in the administration of the State, nor shall it be construed as prejudicing their rights or status in any way"") permits States to grant or not to grant to their public employees the right to join trade unions.
.In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall that the establishment of federations and confederations falls within the scope of Convention No.  and not Convention No. ; Convention No.  (which applies to all workers with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police (Article () and consequently, applies to public servants) states explicitly in Article  that ""workers' and employers' organizations shall have the right to establish and join federations and confederations ..."". Furthermore, Article  of Convention No.  reads: ""The provisions of Articles ,  and  hereof apply to federations and confederations of workers' and employers' organizations"" and Article  of Convention No.  specifically provides for the right without previous authorization, freely to join organizations, subject only to the rules of the organizations concerned. Consequently, organizations of public servants should be able to affiliate, if they so choose, to federations or confederations of workers in the private sector if the rules of such organizations so permit.
.In this regard, the Committee has made reference on previous occasions to the opinion of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, according to which it seems difficult to reconcile with Article  of Convention No.  a provision of law prohibiting organizations of public officials from adhering to federations or confederations of industrial or agricultural organizations (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). In addition, at its November  meeting and in connection with its examination of the application of Convention No. , the Committee of Experts addressed a direct request to the Government of Panama, calling upon it to take measures to amend its legislation if the texts did not permit public servants' organizations to adhere to other federation-level organizations which had not been set up for public servants.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to recognize and register, without delay, the affiliation of FENASEP to the Joint Trade Union Central and to keep the Committee informed of developments; it also brings the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Recalling that Article  of Convention No.  explicitly states that workers' and employers' organizations shall have the right to establish and join federations and confederations, the Committee requests the Government to recognize and register, without delay, the affiliation of FENASEP to the Joint Trade Union Central and to keep the Committee informed of developments.(b) The Committee brings the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",1,1998,Panama
77,".At its meeting in November , the Committee stated that it was awaiting the decision on the dismissal of Daro Ulate and Julio Trejos [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that to date the court has made every possible effort to locate representatives of the enterprise against which the complaint has been made, but has been unable to do so for more than one year because the enterprise is no longer at the address indicated in the complaint. The Government adds that it is waiting for the workers to seek a court order against the enterprise. According to the documents provided by the Government, this situation has prevented a final decision from being taken. These documents refer in particular to unsuccessful official efforts to locate the employer enterprise.
.The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.
.At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to send it a copy of the decisions handed down on the dismissal of Messrs Daro Ulate and Julio Trejos [see rd Report, para. ].
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that a copy of the decisions will be sent to the Committee once they have been handed down.
.The Committee notes this information and awaits the decision on the dismissal of Messrs Daro Ulate and Julio Trejos.
.At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to communicate the final judicial ruling on the dismissals of Daro Ulate, Porfirio Beitia and Julio Trejos [see th Report, para. ]. (According to the allegations, the Aribesa company, where these workers worked, went into liquidation and the dismissals took place in violation of the collective agreement.)
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that Porfirio Beitia did not appeal against the judicial ruling that declared the proceedings a nonsuit and ordered the file to be archived as the proceedings had come to an end. With regard to Daro Ulate and Julio Trejos, the domicile of the defendant that was indicated in their judicial complaints has not been found and neither have they requested that the defendant be summoned. The legal authorities have set a date for a hearing for both cases.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to send it a copy of the decisions handed down on the dismissal of Daro Ulate and Julio Trejos.
.At its meeting in June , the Committee made the following recommendations on matters that remained pending [see the th Report, para. ]:The Committee recalls that the Government had requested the Procurator-General of the Nation to carry out an investigation into the allegations of a raid on SUNTRACS headquarters and ill-treatment suffered by unionists during their detention, and requests the Government to ensure that this investigation is carried out quickly, and to keep it informed of the results thereof. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the judicial proceedings concerning the dismissal of the five aforementioned workers, and of the fund to compensate the Aribesa workers who cannot be reinstated.
.In its communication of  November , the Government reiterates that as regards the alleged raid on SUNTRACS headquarters and ill-treatment, investigations by the Ministry of Labour have not found any corroborating documents or other evidence. The Government adds that the Attorney-General s office has stated that efforts to summon those who consider themselves to have been affected by these alleged acts have been almost entirely unsuccessful, and it has not been possible to take any statements. As regards the dismissals, the Government states that the workers Porfirio Beitia, Francisco Lpez, Eugenio Rivas, Daro Ulate and Julio Trejos have lodged a complaint of unjustified dismissal; Mr. Francisco Lpez won a ruling against the company; in the case of Mr. Eugenio Rivas, the case against the company was quashed on the grounds that it had lapsed; and the cases relating to Daro Ulate, Porfirio Beitia and Julio Trejos are still pending.
.The Committee notes this information. It regrets that the investigations on the alleged raid at SUNTRACS headquarters and ill-treatment have not produced any results owing to the lack of cooperation on the part of those involved. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the final judicial ruling on the dismissals of Daro Ulate, Porfirio Beitia and Julio Trejos.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of: (a) the investigation into the raid on SUNTRACS headquarters and the alleged ill-treatment suffered by a number of workers of the Aribesa enterprise; and (b) the judicial proceedings initiated by the dismissed workers Mr. Porfirio Beitia, Mr. Francisco Lpez, Mr. Eugenio Rivas, Mr. Julio Trejos and Mr. Daro Ulate, and the fund to compensate those workers who cannot be reinstated (the enterprise is facing a judicial process of forced liquidation) [see th Report, paras. -].
.In its communication of  March , the Government sent information and documents, according to which the complaint presented by SUNTRACS to the Procurator-General of the Nation did not refer to the alleged raid on the trade union s headquarters, nor to the alleged ill-treatment inflicted on workers during their detention.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee recalls that the Government had requested the Procurator-General of the Nation to carry out investigations into the allegations of a raid on SUNTRACS headquarters and ill-treatment suffered by unionists during their detention, and requests the Government to ensure that this investigation is carried out quickly, and to keep it informed of the results thereof. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the judicial proceedings concerning the dismissal of the five aforementioned workers, and of the fund to compensate the Aribesa workers who cannot be reinstated.
.The Committee last examined this case, concerning arrests and ill-treatment of trade unionists, at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the results of: (a) the judicial procedures initiated by the workers of the Aribesa enterprise, Mr. Porfirio Beitia, Mr. Francisco Lpez, Mr. Eugenio Rivas, Mr. Julio Trejos and Mr Daro Ulate, and as regards the dismissed workers for whom reinstatement is impossible, to make efforts to ensure that funds are secured to compensate them; and (b) the investigations undertaken by the Government Procurator s Office into the alleged raid on SUNTRACS headquarters and the alleged ill-treatment suffered by a number of Aribesa workers during their detention.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government attaches a copy of the note sent to the Procurator-General of the Nation requesting it to carry out the necessary investigations into the raid on SUNTRACS headquarters in January  and the ill?treatment inflicted on those who were detained on that occasion.
.The Committee notes this information. In this regard, the Committee expresses the hope that the investigation will be concluded in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of its final outcome. At the same time, the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided any information on the judicial proceedings initiated by the abovementioned workers of the Aribesa enterprise and on the fund to compensate those workers who cannot be reinstated. The Committee therefore urges the Government to send the information requested without delay.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  and June  meetings and presented interim reports [see th and st Reports, paras. - and - respectively]. Further government observations were later received in communications dated  September and  October .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The issues pending in this case relate to a collective dispute that arose in January  between the company Aribesa and the Single National Union of Workers of the Construction Industry and Related Occupations (SUNTRACS). The pending allegations relate in particular to the raid on the premises of SUNTRACS and to the ill-treatment to which some of the detained workers (subsequently released) were subjected as a result of the incidents that occurred during a demonstration held in conjunction with a strike which, according to the Government, led to acts of violence and the destruction of property that were the subject of sanctions imposed by the judicial authority. The company dismissed all the workers. At its November  meeting the Committee concluded that the company's decision to dismiss all the workers seemed excessive and appealed to the Government to mediate between the parties with a view to resolving the issue of the dismissals [see th Report, para. ].
.At its June  meeting the Committee made the following recommendations [see st Report, para. ]:- deploring that the Government has not provided more specific information, the Committee strongly requests the Government to provide more precise information concerning the settlement of the labour dispute between the Single National Union of Workers of the Construction Industry and Related Occupations (SUNTRACS) and the Aribesa",1,1998,Panama
78,"enterprise and, more particularly, concerning whether the dismissed workers have been reinstated;- the Committee once again urges the Government to send as soon as possible its observations concerning the raid on the premises of the SUNTRACS trade union; and- regarding the allegations of ill-treatment suffered by certain detained workers, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that an independent inquiry is urgently carried out and, if such allegations are found to be true, to punish the guilty parties and provide compensation for any damages suffered by the detained workers concerned. It also requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken to this end and of the results thereof.
.In its communications of  September and  October , the Government states that the workers dismissed by the Aribesa enterprise submitted industrial complaints to the judicial authority and that judicial settlements were agreed to by two workers, out-of-court settlements were agreed to by  workers, rulings were handed down in favour of four workers, one ruling was handed down in favour of the enterprise in relation to one worker and there were three withdrawals. Still pending, awaiting a new hearing date, are the actions relating to the workers Porfirio Beitia, Francisco Lpez, Eugenio Rivas, Julio Trejos and Daro Ulate. The Government explains that the enterprise subsequently had financial problems and that the National Reinsurance Committee in June  requested its forced liquidation before the courts owing to solvency problems. Given that the enterprise is in liquidation it is impossible for the Government to order the reinstatement of the workers, particularly bearing in mind that the dismissed workers failed at the appropriate time to submit an industrial complaint to the Board of Conciliation and Decision of the province of Coln (they had three months as from the date of the dismissal to do so).
.Concerning the alleged raid on the headquarters of SUNTRACS and the alleged ill-treatment of SUNTRACS workers during their detention, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour has carried out investigations and has found nothing to substantiate these claims. Nevertheless, the Government has been in touch with the Government Prosecutor's Office, the body responsible for investigating offences, and has instructed it to carry out investigations and if the punishable conduct is found to be true, to request the corresponding penalties.
.The Committee notes the rulings (), withdrawals (), judicial settlements () and out-of-court settlements () that resulted from the judicial complaints submitted by the workers dismissed by the Aribesa enterprise. The Committee observes that four of the rulings are in favour of workers. Nevertheless, it notes that the Aribesa enterprise is facing a judicial process of forced liquidation owing to solvency problems, thus making it impossible to reinstate the workers. The Committee asks the Government to make efforts to ensure that funds are secured to compensate the dismissed workers. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the other judicial procedures initiated by the workers Porfirio Beitia, Francisco Lpez, Eugenio Rivas, Julio Trejos and Daro Ulate, which are still pending.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the investigations undertaken by the Ministry of Labour into the alleged raid on SUNTRACS headquarters and into the alleged ill-treatment suffered by a number of workers during the period of their detention did not find any evidence to substantiate those claims. The Committee also notes that the Government has asked the Government Procurator's Office to carry out further investigations and to request the corresponding penalties be imposed if the allegations are proved to be true. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of these investigations.
.The Committee expresses its deep concern that nearly three years have elapsed since the facts alleged have occurred without the allegations having been clarified. The Committee urges the Government to expedite procedures and investigations with a view to resolving the case rapidly.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the judicial procedures initiated by the workers of the Aribesa enterprise Mr. Porfirio Beitia, Mr. Francisco Lpez, Mr. Eugenio Rivas, Mr. Julio Trejos and Mr. Daro Ulate. As regards the dismissed workers for whom reinstatement is impossible, the Committee urges the Government to make efforts to ensure that funds are secured to compensate them.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigations undertaken by the Government Procurator's Office into the alleged raid on SUNTRACS headquarters and the alleged ill-treatment suffered by a number of Aribesa workers during their detention.(c) The Committee expresses its deep concern that nearly three years have elapsed since the occurrence of the facts alleged without the allegations having been clarified. The Committee urges the Government to expedite procedures and investigations with a view to resolving the case rapidly.
.The Committee examined this complaint at its November  meeting and presented an interim report (see th Report, paras. -). The Government's observations were subsequently received in a communication dated  January .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the Government replies in very general terms that the labour dispute which arose between the Single National Union of Workers of the Construction Industry and Related Occupations (SUNTRACS) and the construction enterprise Aribesa was settled in accordance with law. Deplorings that it has not provided more specific information on the nature of the settlement and, more particularly, concerning the dismissal, the Committee requests the Government to provide more precise information on the settlement of the labour dispute between the SUNTRACS trade union and the Aribesa enterprise and, more particularly, concerning whether the dismissed workers have been reinstated.
.The Committee further observes that once again the Government has not provided information concerning the raid on the SUNTRACS premises. In this respect, it recalls that the right of the inviolability of trade union premises also necessarily implies that the public authorities may not insist on entering such premises without prior authorization or without having obtained a legal warrant to do so (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee accordingly once again urges the Government to send as soon as possible more detailed observations concerning the raid on the premises of the SUNTRACS trade union.
.Concerning the allegations of detentions and ill-treatment, the Committee observes that, in asserting that the General Secretariat of the Mayor's Office of Coln has no record of any indictment of the workers detained during the demonstration held on  January , or of their having been detained or arrested, the Government contradicts its previous reply in the matter. The Government itself had sent on  May  ""a copy of the judicial ruling which fined Mr. Javier Mndez and Mr. Marcos Andrades ... for damaging property"" (th Report of the Committee, para. ). In this respect, the Committee recalls that in cases of alleged torture or ill-treatment while in detention, governments should carry out inquiries into complaints of this kind so that appropriate measures, including compensation for damages suffered and sanctioning of those responsible, are taken to ensure that no detainee is subjected to such treatment (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). The Committee accordingly requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that an independent inquiry is carried out urgently into the allegations of ill-treatment suffered by certain detained workers and, if such allegations are found to be true, to punish the guilty parties and provide compensation for any damages suffered. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken to this end and the results thereof.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deploring that the Government has not provided more specific information, the Committee strongly requests the Government to provide more precise information concerning the settlement of the labour dispute between the Single National Union of Workers of the Construction Industry and Related Occupations (SUNTRACS) and the Aribesa enterprise and, more particularly, concerning whether the dismissed workers have been reinstated.(b) The Committee once again urges the Government to send as soon as possible its observations concerning the raid on the premises of the SUNTRACS trade union.(c) Regarding the allegations of ill-treatment suffered by certain detained workers, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure than an independent inquiry is urgently carried out and, if such allegations are found to be true, to punish the guilty parties and provide compensation for any damages suffered by the detained workers concerned. It also requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken to this end and of the results thereof.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the International Confederation",1,1998,Panama
79,"of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  November  and  May .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that  leaders or members of the Single National Union of Workers of the Construction Industry and Related Occupations (SUNTRACS) were arrested on  January  during a peaceful demonstration (during a strike in the construction enterprise Aribesa in Los Lagos district, Coln Province) and detained for five days. The demonstration took place in the streets near the housing project which was being built by the company. The trade unionists in question were: Marcos Andrades of the union's national executive; Javier Mndez, union member; Julio E. Trejos, union representative; Juan C. Salas, union representative; Luis Avila, union representative; Alejandro De la Rosa, union member; Daro Melle, union member; Efran Ballesteros, union representative; Martn Montao, union member; Anbal Alvarado, union member; Luis Gonzlez, union representative; Tomas Mendoza, union representative; and Fernando Tlubet of the union's national executive. The ICFTU states that during their detention, the trade unionists endured inhuman conditions, with no water or sanitation, and that Mr. Luis Gonzlez and others were assaulted and ill-treated by members of the national police. According to the complainant, the strike had been declared in protest at the company's failure to comply with certain conditions relating to the payment of social security contributions, provision of safety equipment, dismissals of workers, payment of the lighting clause, and payment of workers hired by subcontractors.
.The ICFTU adds that on  January , following the protest demonstrations of  January, the premises of SUNTRACS in the city of Coln were raided by agents of the national police, who arrested  union members. The order for the arrests was issued by the Mayor of the city of Coln. Among those arrested were the following: Carlos Agrazal, representative; Nicols Romero, union representative; Daro Ulate, union member; Sal Mndez, the union's national defence secretary; Luis F. Araz; Valentn Sanjur; Sixto Ferreira; Pormilio Beita; Alberto Glvez, a human rights activist; Juan Rosero; Sebastin Hernndez; and Guillermo Ortega. The detainees were all taken on the same night of  January to the Third Night Tribunal and sentenced to five days' non-commutable detention.
.According to the secretary-general of SUNTRACS, the arrests were made on the grounds that the persons concerned had allegedly obstructed public roads, shown disrespect to authority and disturbed public order. On  January , the union lodged a complaint with the National General Prosecutor alleging abuse of authority and action exceeding official powers by the Mayor of Coln, the night judge and the Cristbal magistrate.
.In its communications of  May,  November and  May , the Government states that the conflict in the present complaint originated in the dismissals of five workers from the company Aribesa on  January . On ,  and  January, the workers stopped operations in Los Lagos whereupon the company decided to dismiss all the workers involved. On  January , SUNTRACS presented a list of complaints against the company Aribesa alleging violations of signed accords and the collective labour agreement. The company replied on  of the same month, within the period required by law, and refuted all the complaints set out in the list. Talks on the list of complaints began on  January and the union, as a bargaining tactic, demanded the reinstatement of all the dismissed workers and an investigation into the cases of the five workers dismissed on  January. The company stated that it was prepared to discuss the matter. On  February the company's negotiators were not present at the conciliation talks. On the following day, the company requested that the talks be suspended until the next day, when it would give its reply concerning the reinstatement of the dismissed workers, compliance with the accords signed with the union on  January , the  per cent payment, and payment of tool hire charges. On  February, the company undertook to comply with the agreements signed on  January  and that this would be done between  and  February. However, it refused outright to discuss the reinstatement of the dismissed workers. On the same day, the union and the company resolved to declare the conciliation process terminated, although the period of  days specified in paragraph  of section  of the Labour Code was not due to elapse until  February. The union had  working days from  February onwards within which it could declare a strike. The negotiations took place in an uneasy atmosphere of mutual recriminations and no agreement was reached on the list of complaints. In short, the talks did not lead to any agreement regarding reinstatement of the dismissed workers, since in the company's view these dismissals were legally justified. The union finally issued a strike declaration for  February . The authorities endeavoured throughout these proceedings to bring the parties to an agreement.
.The Government explains that in the early days of the dispute in mid-January , during the protest demonstrations in the streets of Coln, members of SUNTRACS employed by the company committed acts of violence and destruction of private property and clashed with a group of workers led by the director, Marcos Allen. These workers had been hired by the company to replace the SUNTRACS workers. Such clashes were a violation of the procedures, established under the Labour Code by which workers can enforce their rights, violated the constitutional right of freedom of movement and resulted in damage to property. For these reasons the Mayor ordered the arrest of about  of the workers, who were subsequently released and enjoy full liberty.
.The Government provides a copy of the judicial ruling which fined Mr. Javier Mndez and Mr. Marcos Andrade the sum of  balboas for damaging property and stated that a group of persons presumed to be members of the trade union organization SUNTRACS had tried to obstruct workers who were working normally at a site in Los Lagos. The Government also supplies copies of the labour court ruling against a number of SUNTRACS members (Luis F. Araz, Valentn Sanjur, Juan Rosero, Daro Ulate, Guillermo Ortega, Pormilio Beita, Sebastin Hernndez, Nicols Romero, Sal Mndez and Sixto Ferreira) imposing fines and five days of arrest for causing a breach of the peace and obstructing highways, disturbing public order, peace and safety and showing gross disrespect to the Mayor of Coln and his family. Mr. Alberto Glvez was ordered to pay a fine equivalent to  days' arrest for obstructing the police and for disrespect towards authority.
.The Government indicates that the complainant itself states that the persons mentioned in the complaint were detained because they were accused of obstructing public highways, showing disrespect towards authority and disturbing public order. The Government considers that the alleged acts which have been established by the authorities (obstruction of highways, disturbances during illegal demonstrations, infringements of public order, peace and safety, damage to property, etc.) are not sanctioned by the ILO's freedom of association Conventions.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant alleges that  trade unionists from the union SUNTRACS were detained following a peaceful demonstration during a strike, that the union's premises were raided, and that some of the detainees were ill-treated and held in inhuman conditions.
.The Committee notes that the Government denies that the demonstration was peaceful and states that the demonstrators destroyed or damaged property, committed acts of violence, tried to prevent other workers from working normally, prevented free movement by blocking roads and showed gross disrespect to the Mayor of Coln. In this regard, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the acts of violence took place after the company Aribesa had dismissed five workers and decided subsequently -- citing as a reason the stoppage of construction work which occurred immediately afterwards -- to dismiss all the workers, and that the union regarded this action as a violation of the collective agreement and the accords signed with the company. The Committee emphasizes that, although a number of trade unionists were fined and/or sentenced to five days' detention by a court for the reasons indicated (and all of them have now been released), the company's decision to dismiss all the workers -- which according to the Government's statements has not yet been implemented -- seems excessive. Under these circumstances, the Committee appeals to the Government to mediate between the parties (the trade union SUNTRACS and the company Aribesa) with a view to resolving the problem of alleged failures to comply with legislation and the collective agreement cited by the union as well as the issue of the dismissals.
.Lastly, noting that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the raid of SUNTRACS premises and the ill-treatment and inhuman conditions",0,1998,Panama
80,"suffered by a number of SUNTRACS members, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee appeals to the Government to mediate between the parties (the trade union SUNTRACS and the company Aribesa) with a view to resolving the problem of alleged failures to comply with legislation and the collective agreement cited by the union as well as the problem of the dismissals.(b) Noting that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the raid of SUNTRACS premises and the ill-treatment and inhuman conditions suffered by a number of SUNTRACS members, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.",1,1998,Panama
81,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) of  July .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  February .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) alleges that, at the end of June ,  trade union leaders in the education sector and five teachers at the Isabel Herrera Obaldo School were dismissed in contravention of ILO Convention No.  following a six-day strike in that sector, although the right of public servants to strike is guaranteed under Panamanian law. The CLAT explains that the decision to strike followed the presentation to the Legislature of draft Education Act No.  on which there was no consultation and which undermines teachers' living conditions (by decentralizing the education system, reducing holidays and abolishing the Staff Council).
.In its communications of  September  and  February , the Government states that the dispute in the education sector was resolved by an agreement dated  July  between representatives of the teaching unions and the Ministries of the Presidency and Education. The Government attaches the text of this agreement and that of Act  of  August , which established the school education councils and contained various other provisions. The Government states that its intention was to modernize the national education system in order to bring it into line with current educational thinking.
.The Government adds that, as a result of the agreement, it reinstated all the teachers who had been dismissed.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant alleged mass dismissals of teachers following a strike at the end of June .
.The Committee notes the agreement between the teaching unions and the authorities dated  July , transmitted by the Government, which ended the collective dispute in the education sector. The Committee notes with interest that as a result of that agreement, all the teachers who had been dismissed following the strike were reinstated in their posts. The Committee hopes that in future, the authorities will fully take into account the principle according to which ""no one should be penalized for carrying out or attempting to carry out a legitimate strike"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, para. ). Nevertheless, given that the present case was resolved satisfactorily by a collective agreement and all the teachers who had been dismissed were reinstated in their posts, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee, while recalling that no one should be penalized for carrying out or attempting to carry out legitimate strike action, invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1997,Panama
82,".At its meeting in June , referring to its request that the Government consider amending certain provisions in its legislation which presented problems in terms of conformity with Conventions Nos.  and , the Committee had noted that the Government had begun general consultations with the social partners and had requested it to keep it informed of the outcome of these consultations [see st Report, para. ].
.In its communication dated  September , the Government reports a divergence of views among the social partners concerning the amendment of certain legislative provisions and points out that the Government does not have the necessary majority in Parliament to pass a bill amending the Labour Code. The Government states that in order to carry out legislative reform consultations first had to be held and a consensus achieved among the social partners. Faced with this complex situation, the Government reaffirms its determination to make every effort to enable the representative organizations of employers and workers to reach, through dialogue, the agreement that would make it possible to present draft legislation covering all of the points raised by the Committee on Freedom of Association. To this effect, the Government deems it appropriate to request technical assistance from the San Jos Multidisciplinary Team, which would help reach a favourable solution to this case, and hopes that once such assistance has been obtained this will open the way to the tripartite consensus necessary to resolve the matter.
.The Committee notes this information and hopes that such technical assistance will make it possible to register progress in the near future.
.The Committee first examined this case at its meeting of May  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras.  to , adopted by the Governing Body at its nd Session (June )).
.Subsequently, the Government sent further observations in a communication dated  May .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its previous examination of the case, the Committee presented the following conclusions regarding the allegations remaining pending (see th Report, paras.  to ):The Committee notes that the complainant organization opposes the provision of the Labour Code which requires the employer to pay wages when the strike has the following objects: () to demand fulfilment of any collective agreement, direct settlement or arbitration award (section () of the Labour Code); () to obtain fulfilment of and compliance with any statutory provision which has been ignored or infringed once or repeatedly throughout or in any part of the enterprise (section () of the Labour Code); () if the employer does not reply to the statement of claims or withdraws from the conciliation procedure (section () of the Labour Code); and () if the employer fails to comply with the obligation of closing down the enterprise in the event of a legal strike (section  of the Labour Code). The Committee notes furthermore that as regards these matters the complainant organizations point out that under the current regulations the labour administration authorities are not empowered to reject a flawed statement of claims which alleges imaginary or unfounded infringements of labour standards; and that according to the complainants, the conciliation procedure would be initiated and the strike could then be declared and the employer would have to pay the strike days in the circumstances referred to above.
.Before examining the allegations relating to the payment of wages of strikers by the employer, the Committee needs clarification and information on the following points: () the manner in which sections  and  of the Labour Code are applied in practice; and () the existence of procedures and competent bodies in the event of violations of the legislation or of collective agreements, in the event of disputes over their interpretation or in the event that the employer fails to cooperate in the collective bargaining process. The Committee requests the Government to supply information in this regard.
.In the light of these interim conclusions regarding these aspects of the case, the Committee, in June , invited the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations (see th report, para. ):-- Before examining the allegations relating to the payment of wages of strikers by the employer, the Committee needs information and clarification on the following points: () the manner in which sections  and  of the Labour Code are applied in practice; and () the existence of procedures and competent bodies in the event of violations of the legislation or of collective agreements, in the event of disputes over their interpretation or in the event that the employer fails to cooperate in the collective bargaining process. The Committee requests the Government to supply information in this respect.-- The Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the Office is at its disposal, if it so wishes, to assist it in ensuring that the provisions complained of in this case are amended in line with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining.-- The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the present case.
.Furthermore, the Committee, at its March  meeting, while noting that the Government had requested the Office's technical assistance, requested the Government to provide a response to the issues raised in the case so that the technical assistance requested could be based on the definitive conclusions and recommendations of the Committee (see th Report, para. ).
.With regard to the information requested by the Committee at its previous examination of the case, the Government makes reference in its communication dated  May  to sections  and  of Cabinet Decree No. ,  (Labour Code), regarding the imputability of a strike to the employer.
.In respect of these sections, the Government indicates that the imputability of responsibility for a strike is a judicial process falling to labour tribunals, whose rulings, if contested, may be appealed against before the High Labour Tribunals, with final cassation being sought before the third chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. This is a proceeding designed to give rapid relief and in which it is incumbent upon the workers to prove that the strike was due to failure to comply with ""the collective agreement, direct settlement or arbitration award"" or legal texts which have been ""ignored or infringed once or repeatedly"" by the employer, as addressed by the conciliation procedure ensuing from the presentation of the statement of claims, which failed to result in any agreement. Proof may also be supplied of the employer not having responded to the statement of claims or having withdrawn from the conciliation process.
.The Government adds that grounds for imputability may also result during a strike, as stated in section , e.g. if the closure of the enterprise is not permitted, whereas it is a direct object of the strike, or if new contracts of employment are signed with a view to resuming the work interrupted by strike action, with the exception of contracts for the purpose of ""avoiding irreparable damage to machinery and basic equipment"", when strike participants do not permit such work and the administrative authorities consider it urgent. In this case, the employer applies to the administrative authorities for authorization to carry out such work. In the majority of instances, when the request is approved, the enterprise staff itself is called upon to conduct such tasks which need to be maintenance and not production work. Responsibility is also imputable to an employer who prevents workers from conducting the activities listed in section  of the Labour Code, as follows:Section : Strike participants shall be guaranteed outside the enterprise:
.the right to peaceful demonstration;
.the right to distribute propaganda amongst fellow-workers and the general public as well as to use posters indicating their demands;
.the right to set up propaganda- and watch-pickets surrounding work premises; and
.the right to collect donations.Furthermore, if the employer attempts to prevent strike action, she/he may also be declared responsible for the strike.
.According to the Government, any employer declared responsible shall pay wages for the strike period; this is decided by the judge when she/he determines liability for the strike. Consequently, the proceedings are designed to establish whether the employer has or has not given grounds, as listed in the law, to be attributed responsibility. As stated, this takes place in the form of adversarial judicial proceedings.
.The Government indicates that, specifically for the collective bargaining period, there are no ""competent bodies in the event of violations of the legislation or of collective agreements, in the event of disputes over their interpretation or in the event that the employer fails to cooperate in the collective bargaining process"". Nevertheless, Act No. , , does empower the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development to conduct proceedings regarding the ""legal interpretation or validity of clauses written into a collective agreement or other collective pact or accord"". Moreover, section  of the Labour Code states that:Whosoever seeks",-1,1997,Panama
83,"the exercise of any right, or the declaration that the existence or non-existence of a right is counter to his/her interests, similarly the existence or non-existence of a legal relationship affecting or concerning him/her or whosoever seeks any declaration affecting or concerning him/her, may make the relevant claim before the tribunals in the manner laid down in this Code.In this connection, there has been no discussion in Panama regarding the consequences of such proceedings in the event of a statement of claims being presented or of scrutiny of collective bargaining. Would the proceedings be put into abeyance if reference were made to items also addressed in the statement of claims or the bargaining? Which authority is competent to determine these consequences? These are issues which should be elucidated through administrative or judicial channels.
.The Committee observes that the issues left pending at the previous examination of the case relate to the conformity with the principles of freedom of association of the legal texts applicable to cases in which the employer is required to pay wages in respect of strike days; more specifically, they concern cases in which the strike has the following objects: () to demand fulfilment of any collective agreement, direct settlement or arbitration award (section () of the Labour Code); () obtain fulfilment of and compliance with any statutory provision which has been ignored or infringed once or repeatedly throughout or in any part of the enterprise (section () of the Labour Code); and () if the employer does not reply to the statement of claims or withdraws from the conciliation procedure (section () of the Labour Code). As regards these matters, the complainant organizations also point out that under the current regulations the labour administration authorities are not empowered to reject a flawed statement of claims which alleges imaginary or unfounded infringements of labour standards; in this way, the conciliation procedure would be initiated and the strike could then be declared and the employer would have to pay the strike days.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the legal provisions obliging the employer to pay wages in respect of strike days, the Committee notes the Government's statement and in particular that the employer's ""responsibility"" for the (lawful) strike is declared in the course of relief proceedings, during which it is incumbent upon the workers to substantiate grounds for imputability of responsibility, as laid down by legislation, namely:-- failure to fulfil any collective agreement, direct settlement or arbitration award (section () of the Labour Code);-- failure to fulfil and comply with any statutory provision once or repeatedly in an enterprise, establishment, branch or works (section () of the Labour Code);-- failure to comply with the obligation of closing down the enterprise in the event of a strike (section  of the Labour Code) (in a previous examination of the case in its substance, the Committee had requested the Government to repeal the sections of the Labour Code, which imposed the immediate shutting down of the enterprise, establishment, branch or works once a strike had been declared; see th Report, para.  (a)(i));-- the signing of new contracts of employment in order to resume work interrupted by the strike (except where strike participants permit work to proceed in order to avoid irreparable damage to machinery and basic equipment (section ));-- preventing workers from exercising certain rights outside the establishment (peaceful demonstration, propaganda, propaganda- and watch-pickets as well as the collection of donations) (section );-- preventing strike action or seriously and unjustly obstructing it (section ); and-- failure to reply to the statement of claims or withdrawal from the conciliation procedure (section ()).
.In this respect, although the majority of aforementioned grounds for imputability of responsibility for the strike to the employer constitute violations of Conventions Nos.  and  and unlawful acts sanctioned in various forms in many countries for violation of the right to strike, failure to bargain in good faith or other unfair practices, the Committee considers that obliging the employer to pay wages in respect of strike days in the cases mentioned -- apart from potentially disrupting the balance in industrial relations and proving costly for the employer -- raises problems of conformity with the principles of freedom of association, to the extent that such payment should be neither required nor prohibited (see th Report, Case No. , para. ); consequently, it should be a matter for resolution between the parties. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation in the manner indicated.
.Moreover, the Committee recalls that the complainant organizations of employers had pointed out that under the current regulations the labour administration authorities were not empowered to reject a flawed statement of claims which alleged imaginary or unfounded infringements of labour standards; in this way, the conciliation procedure would be initiated and the strike could then be declared and the employer would have to pay the strike days. Similarly, the Committee had requested the Government to provide information indicating whether there were procedures or competent bodies in the event of violations of the legislation or of collective agreements, in the event of disputes over their interpretation or in the event that the employer failed to cooperate in the collective bargaining process.
.In this regard, the Committee notes the Government's statement that: () specifically for the collective bargaining period, there are no ""competent bodies in the event of violations of the legislation or of collective agreements, in the event of disputes over their interpretation or in the event that the employer fails to cooperate in the collective bargaining process""; () nevertheless, Act No. , , does empower the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development to conduct proceedings regarding the ""legal interpretation or validity of clauses written into a collective agreement or other collective pact or accord""; () section  of the Labour Code authorizes any person, who so wishes, to request of the judicial authorities a declaration that a right or legal relationship does or does not exist or any other kind of declaration. However, the Committee notes that, as emerges from the Government's statement, the practical application of the aforementioned legal texts -- in particular in respect of disputes over rights -- has not yet taken place; and that the issues raised (possible suspension of the examination of the statement of claims, competent bodies, etc.) should be elucidated where necessary through administrative or judicial channels.
.Consequently, the Committee recommends to the Government that it develop existing standards and procedures regarding conflicts of rights or interpretation as well as establish a clear, expeditious procedure, which would involve workers' and employers' organizations, for verifying non-compliance with legal provisions and clauses of collective agreements, making it possible to avoid collective disputes on the grounds under consideration. As regards the legal consequences of the employer's failure to reply to the statement of claims or his/her withdrawal from the conciliation procedure, the Committee considers that failure to reply to a statement of claims may be deemed an unfair practice contrary to the principle of good faith in collective bargaining, which may entail certain penalties as foreseen by law, without resulting, as is the case above, in a legal obligation upon the employer to pay strike days which is a matter to be left to the parties concerned. With regard to withdrawal from the conciliation procedure, the Committee observes that the legislation lays down mandatory conciliation and prevents the employer from withdrawing, irrespective of circumstances, at the risk of being penalized by payment of wages in respect of strike days; apart from being disproportionate, this runs counter to the principle of voluntary negotiation enshrined in Convention No. . In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to envisage amending the legislation in such a way that: () failure to reply to a statement of claims does not entail disproportionate penalties, and () withdrawal by one of the parties from the conciliation procedure does not give rise to disproportionate penalties.
.With regard to the Government's request for technical assistance, the Committee recalls that the technical assistance of the Office is at its disposal with a view to ensuring that the legislation conforms more widely to the Conventions ratified regarding freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to envisage amending the legislation in such a way that: () the payment of wages in respect of strike days is not mandatory but a matter for resolution by the parties; () the withdrawal by one of the parties from the conciliation procedure does not give rise to disproportionate penalties; and () that failure to reply to a statement of claims does not entail disproportionate penalties.(b) The Committee recommends that, in developing existing standards and procedures regarding conflicts of rights or interpretation, the Government establish a clear, expeditious procedure,",0,1997,Panama
84,"which would involve workers' and employers' organizations, for verifying non-compliance with legal provisions and clauses of collective agreements, making it possible to avoid collective disputes on the grounds under consideration.(c) With regard to the Government's request for technical assistance, the Committee recalls that the technical assistance of the Office is at its disposal with a view to ensuring that the legislation conforms more widely to the Conventions ratified regarding freedom of association and collective bargaining.(d) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case.
.The complaint appears in a joint communication from the International Organization of Employers (IOE) and the National Council of Private Enterprise of Panama (CONEP) dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  March .
.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the International Organization of Employers (IOE) and the National Council of Private Enterprise of Panama (CONEP) allege that Ministerial Decree No.  of  December , published in the Gaceta Oficial (Official Gazette) No.  of  February , which was amended by Act No.  of  August , contains provisions which contradict international labour Conventions Nos.  and .
.The complainant organizations point out that section  establishes, without the right to any appeal whatsoever, the immediate shutting down or closure of undertakings, establishments, branches or works affected by a strike, in contravention of Article  of Convention No. , which establishes the right of employers to organize their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, and of the principle of the inviolability of the domicile of the social partners.
.In this way, once a strike is initiated, the labour administration authorities immediately seal the doors of the establishments or businesses of employers, including those giving access to the administrative and management offices. The labour administration authorities order the police authorities to ""guarantee that the undertaking remains closed and give due protection to persons and property;"". In other words, the police authorities must guarantee that employers are not able to enter their businesses.
.In the same way, section  of the above-mentioned Decree orders the closing down of undertakings, establishments, branches or works if a strike is declared by an industrial trade union or even an enterprise union. This affects not only the employer but the other workers who are not on strike. This situation of total closure does not encourage voluntary collective bargaining and makes it more difficult to resolve a dispute. The employer cannot be expected to want to negotiate a rapid and effective resolution of a dispute if he is deprived of his right of free access to his property and his freedom of movement is limited. The situation caused by the closure order does not encourage good faith in bargaining.
.The complainant organizations believe that such a closing down of enterprises is not a symbolic act. The labour administration authorities apply the concept of ""immediate closure"" by placing long plastic or paper seals on all doors providing access to all the industrial and commercial installations and offices affected by the strike. These seals may be removed only by the labour inspectors, when the strike is over, or, temporarily, when the workers allow, under their supervision, essential work to be carried out for the maintenance or repair of equipment and machinery. This affects the autonomy of one of the social partners in the bargaining process.
.Furthermore, the total closure of enterprises prevents the recruitment of third parties to carry out maintenance work. Strikers usually give permission for this in exchange for concessions from the employers.
.The IOE and CONEP point out that the closing down of enterprises involves the paralysis of all administrative or financial activities, thus jeopardizing the future of the enterprises or businesses. During a strike, employers are not able to use their offices, computer equipment, files, or any of their own facilities which are necessary for the administration of their business. Thus employers have no other alternative but to use their own homes or rented premises to coordinate their negotiations and carry out the transactions which are indispensable to the survival of their enterprises. In doing so, however, they run the risk that the strikers accuse them of having infringed the closure order.
.Furthermore, the complainant organizations allege that section  compounds the infringements of the principle of freedom of action of employers by establishing two suppositions which can be used to force them to pay the wages which strikers do not receive during a strike: the first, if workers have gone on strike to demand fulfilment of a collective labour agreement, direct agreement or arbitration award; and the second, if employers have infringed the order for the total closure of enterprises as described above.
.The second supposition of section  concerns the treatment of legal disputes or those concerning a point of law which, in accordance with the provisions of section , shall be bound by the rules established by the Labour Code. However, none of the provisions contained in sections  to  of Decree No.  requires workers' trade union organizations to present a copy of the unfulfilled ruling or award as a requirement for initiating the conciliation procedure. In other words, the workers may subject the employer to a conciliation procedure by accusing him of imaginary or alleged violations or infringements. There is no standard which allows the labour administration authorities to reject the presentation of a statement of claims, and the said presentation automatically initiates the conciliation procedure. Section  establishes without exception that ""a statement of claims cannot be refused or dismissed"". The labour administration authority may point out any flaws or defects in the statement but must do so immediately. In practice, the labour administration authority may insist that these flaws or defects are made good, but at no time and in any circumstance is it empowered to reject outright a defective statement of claims or one in which allegations are made concerning imaginary or unfounded infringements.
.Section  offers the parties to a dispute the option of requesting mediation by the labour administration authorities in the event of a legal collective dispute. However, the workers may commence the conciliation procedure if the dispute is of such a nature as to admit the possibility of exercising the right to strike. But the law does not define which legal disputes may give rise to the exercise of such a right.
.Decree No.  does not contain any standard which indicates how employers may present a statement of claims if a trade union of workers fails to comply with what has been agreed or infringes any legal provision. Decree No.  does not contain any conciliation procedure enabling the employers to exercise, as a last resort, their right to lockout.
.In practice, whenever workers initiate a strike, the order for the total closing down of the establishments of employers prevents the latter from having free access to their property. The closing down of their establishments or offices is a serious interference by the authorities in the activities of employers and an infringement of the right to the inviolability of their domicile; it restricts their freedom of action and their right to free movement; it is incompatible with the principle of bargaining in good faith and the principle of free and voluntary bargaining. All this seriously undermines the guarantees established by Convention No.  on behalf of employers.
.The complainants also allege that section  establishes that the statement of claims presented by the workers' trade union organization must contain, amongst other things, the following: "". Name, identity card number and address of the delegates designated for the conciliation procedure who shall be not less than two in number and not more than five, accompanied, if they think it necessary or advisable, by a trade union adviser and a legal adviser ..."". This provision applies by analogy to the composition of the bargaining group of the employers. It directly violates the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining as established by Article  of Convention No. . The complainants also refer to the principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association. According to the complainants, employers should have the freedom to establish their own bargaining team and to be assisted by the technical, financial and legal advisers they consider appropriate for the defence of their interests, without any limitations being placed on the number and status of such persons.
.Finally, the complainant organizations allege that although section  of Decree No.  provides for the end of conciliation if and when ""... the parties come to an arrangement or agree to proceed to arbitration"", section  establishes that employers have to accept that the dispute shall be submitted, as a whole or in separate parts, for arbitration if the workers ""before or during the strike, apply to",0,1997,Panama
85,"the regional directorate of labour of the General Directorate of Labour for arbitration"". This provision is contrary to the principle of free and voluntary bargaining. In this respect, the complainant organizations refer to the principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association and emphasize that arbitration, in order to be effective and efficient, must be the result of the will of both parties; similar objections could also be made against a provision enabling the employers to impose arbitration, before or during a strike.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that article  of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Panama establishes the right to strike and at a secondary level, as a legal reserve, that ""the law shall regulate its exercise"". To this end, the Labour Code devotes a title to the right to strike, which comprises sections  to , in addition to certain references contained in other provisions, which include those relating to the statement of claims, the conciliation procedure, arbitration, etc. All these provisions were subject to analysis in the discussion and preparation of the legal document which became Act No.  of  August  ""to establish standards to regulate and modernize labour relations"", which contains some reforms to the Labour Code, including standards respecting collective labour disputes, which is the subject referred to in the present complaint.
.The Government adds that this Act was the result of a consensus and tripartite negotiation in which the main participants, the employers and the workers, played an active part. Within this process, which was fully carried out, no modification was made of the standards to which reference is made in this complaint, although the subject was sometimes mentioned. The above-mentioned situation makes it difficult for the Government, which is respectful of conciliation and consensus, to discuss the matter to which reference is made in the complaint, which is also a very sensitive one since it deals with the right to strike, a fundamental principle of labour relations and which has been enshrined, protected and preserved in different international labour Conventions.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Observing that the legislation complained of is not sufficiently clear with regard to certain aspects, that it regulates industrial relations in too much detail and constitutes a significant interference, and that certain provisions are contrary to the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government without delay and in consultation with the social partners to take the necessary measures to:(i) repeal sections () and  of the Labour Code, which impose the immediate shutting down of the enterprise, establishment, branch or works once a strike has been declared;(ii) amend section () which permits the imposition of arbitration at the request of one of the parties to the collective dispute;(iii) amend section () of the Labour Code, which restricts the composition of the representatives of the parties (delegates and advisers) to the collective bargaining process, so that this issue is determined by the parties themselves;(iv) regulate within the framework of the Labour Code matters relating to the determination of legal disputes which permit the exercise of the right to strike, the possibility for employers to present a statement of claims and the possibility for employers to initiate a conciliation procedure.(b) Before examining the allegations relating to the payment of wages of strikers by the employer, the Committee needs information and clarification on the following points: () the manner in which sections  and  of the Labour Code are applied in practice; and () the existence of procedures and competent bodies in the event of violations of the legislation or of collective agreements, in the event of disputes over their interpretation or in the event that the employer fails to cooperate in the collective bargaining process. The Committee requests the Government to supply information in this respect.(c) The Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the Office is at its disposal, if it so wishes, to assist it in ensuring that the provisions complained of in this case are amended in line with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining.(d) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the present case.",0,1997,Panama
86,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) dated  December . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  March and  May .
.In its meeting of May-June , the Committee decided to request additional information from the complainant organization and the Government so that it could give its opinion on the allegations in full possession of the facts. The Government sent additi*onal information in its communication of  October  but no information was received from the complainant organization.
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  December , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) alleges that, since , Panamanian air traffic controllers have been demanding the promulgation of an Act for the full regulation of the working conditions of air traffic controllers (salary scale, retirement, duties, etc.). The Panamanian Association of Air Traffic Controllers (APACTA) itself submitted a Bill to the Communication and Transport Committee of the Legislative Assembly. However, this did not yield any definite results. After a number of years, the current Panamanian Government decided to take up this issue and set up the Committee to analyse the Bill submitted by the Panamanian air traffic controllers. Having studied the Bill, this tripartite Committee submitted its report together with the revised Bill to the Ministry of the Interior and Justice, which in turn put the new regulation before the Cabinet Council on  August . During all stages of the processing of this initiative no government body expressed any objections to the Bill. The Act was however not promulgated, and the problems faced by the controllers continue.
.CLAT adds that in view of this situation the air traffic controllers in APACTA declared a strike on  November . They demanded the following: () the Government to pass the above-mentioned Bill; () fair treatment and minimum guarantees in keeping with their duties and responsibilities; () better working conditions to enable them to provide a safe and efficient air traffic control service (in particular, improvements to combat the stress arising from working in a high responsibility position, extended periods of time spent sitting down, working in a confined space, shortcomings in the workplace and the symptoms of pharyngitis experienced by a number of workers due to their having to speak constantly for long periods of time); () the Government to approve the salary scale as outlined in Chapter  of the Bill (deadline of  January ); in this connection, CLAT points out that it is the Panamanian air traffic controllers who earn the least of all workers in this sector in the whole of Latin America, in spite of the intensive pace of their work which involves both considerable responsibility and stress; their salary varies between US$ and US$; and () the introduction of special retirement clauses for air traffic controllers, as at present no special provisions exist allowing Panamanian air traffic controllers to retire at an age where their physical and mental capacities are still fully intact, or at least at one where there is no danger to the safety and efficiency of the duties they perform; Panamanian air traffic controllers, in their capacity as public officials, must at present conform with the retirement age stipulated in the general regulations of the Social Security Fund ( years of age for women and  for men).
.CLAT adds that on  November , the day following the announcement of their partial suspension of activities, which was undertaken in order to obtain the appropriate legal regulation of air traffic, the air traffic controllers were dismissed from their duties and replaced by  foreign air traffic controllers, who obviously had little knowledge of the specific details of Panamanian air traffic control, particularly as far as climatic and geographic conditions are concerned. This situation constitutes a danger to national air traffic safety. According to CLAT, an investigation into developments in the air traffic controllers' dispute since  shows the consistent readiness of these workers to negotiate fairer working conditions more in line with their duties and their level of specialization. The air traffic controllers' struggle is not just a struggle to defend industrial interests but must be taken in the wider context of demands for the safety of the passengers travelling through Panama. In addition, the ILO itself, in a report prepared in , recognizes the existence of serious shortcomings in the employment conditions of Panamanian air traffic controllers. For these reasons, CLAT concludes that the demands made by these workers are entirely legitimate and the Panamanian Government's delay in legislating on the rules governing these workers as well as the dismissal of  of them constitute serious actions which directly infringe upon freedom of association.
.In communications dated  and  March and  May , the Government states that the Civil Aeronautics Directorate (DAC) has its own legal rules, its own capital resources and full autonomy in its administration, and that it is subject to national constitutional and legal provisions. In keeping with prevailing legal provisions, the highest authority in the Civil Aeronautics Directorate is the board of directors which is made up of the Minister of the Interior and Justice, who chairs it, the Minister of Finance and Treasury, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, the Comptroller General of the Republic and the Director-General of the Civil Aeronautics Directorate. Its geographic position makes Panama a major international centre for air traffic control, radar signal control, control towers, information services using a variety of radio frequencies as well as domestic operations. Following a decision by the national authorities and in compliance with the international regulations contained in the treaties signed by Panama, air traffic control is deemed an essential service, meaning that in prevailing penal legislation (Penal Code) obstructing the control of air traffic is defined, classified and punished as an offence. Within the framework of the legal powers regulating its operation, on  July  the board of directors of the Civil Aeronautics Directorate approved the internal staff rules establishing the rights, duties, prohibitions and disciplinary measures applicable to the administrative and technical personnel in all sections of the institution and establishing the guidelines for the procedure relative to various types of staff action, which was set to come into force on  September .
.Referring specifically to the allegations, the Government explains that from  onwards, Panamanian public officials working as air traffic controllers expressed their desire, in their capacity as public officials, for legislation to establish special working conditions for them including an automatic salary scale, special retirement provisions and the regulation of their responsibilities. In October , Mr. Claudio Dutary, a member of the body of air traffic controllers in the service of the Civil Aeronautics Directorate, who at that time was the chairman of an organization called the Air Traffic Controllers' Commission, on his own initiative, submitted a Bill comprised of  sections and an explanatory preamble for the consideration of the Communication and Transport Committee of the Legislative Assembly. This Bill was not favourably received by the legislative body, and was therefore not passed. It should be pointed out that as an independent state body the Legislative Assembly has full authority under the Constitution to decide either for or against Bills submitted for its consideration. The two other state bodies are the Government and the judiciary.
.The Government adds that one year after having taken up office as President of the Republic, Dr. Ernesto Prez Balladares, the current Panamanian President and Head of Government, in response to a request submitted by the Panamanian Association of Air Traffic Controllers (APACTA) -- a civil association comprised of the above-mentioned public officials -- in October  instructed the Ministry of the Interior and Justice and the Civil Aeronautics Directorate to set up a tripartite committee to examine a proposal for the preparation of a draft Bill to govern the employment of such officials. The air traffic controllers were represented in this committee through their association, APACTA, a civil association which was founded with the aim of improving air traffic. This tripartite committee held eight meetings over a period of several months (April-June ) during which matters pertaining to the technical board, the duties, requirements, suitability and civil responsibility of air traffic controllers, and their administrative and penal responsibility were revised, discussed and approved. It also examined other aspects of a more general nature in this sphere, as well as regulations relating to salary scales, retirement provisions, licence cancellations and other issues; written reports were made of each meeting. The subjects of salary scales and special retirement provisions, to which they aspired as public officials, remained pending for further consultation. At the meetings, notes were exchanged, opinions heard and observations made on the draft Bill to be submitted to the Legislative Assembly, and conversations were held among representatives of APACTA, the Civil Aeronautics Directorate, the",0,1996,Panama
87,"Ministry of the Interior and Justice, the Comptroller General of the Republic and the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy. Nevertheless, despite the exchanges taking place among the principal actors involved and the express desire of the President of the Republic, Dr. Ernesto Prez Balladares, to find a final solution to the request to finalize the draft Bill on air traffic controllers, on  November , with no valid reason or justified cause, the air traffic controllers announced their intention, in their capacity as a group of public servants, to suspend their work.
.The Government states that following the communiqu issued by APACTA, the Civil Aeronautics Directorate convened a meeting on  November , which was the day on which it found out about APACTA's decision, and it was at that meeting that the representative of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy informed them of the need to modify the draft Bill, promising a reply within a week. On the afternoon of  November the air traffic controllers presented an ultimatum which was subsequently carried out, the grounds given being the fact that the draft Bill had not been passed by the Government. The complete suspension of the air traffic control service meant that all air links with the country were cut, entailing massive financial losses for both the State and private individuals estimated in terms of millions per day for the sectors concerned. It should be pointed out that the Ministry of Labour had no involvement in the air traffic controllers abandoning their duties as that ministry only has authority in labour matters and the provisions of the prevailing Labour Code are not generally applied to the public services. APACTA is an association of public officials (APACTA's by-laws and regulations correspond to the provisions of the Civil Code); it is seeking to have a Bill passed which, if it became a law of the Republic, would institute the principles and standards aspired to by its members.
.The Government explains that the serious offence committed by the air traffic controllers (only  out of  air traffic controllers came to work) in the only national institution to provide essential services and facilities for the safety of civil aviation at the domestic and international levels, caused the Director-General of the Civil Aeronautics Directorate, in application of the powers vested in him by the institution's organizational law, and the internal staff regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Directorate in force since , to dismiss from their posts the  officials who promoted, encouraged, supported and participated in the ill-timed and injurious massive abandonment of their duties; subsequently paying them the employment benefits they were owed. In accordance with section  of the Constitution the State can apply special restrictions to strikes in the public services, and the Labour Code also requires that the provision of such services be guaranteed in the event of legally declared strikes. The air traffic controllers' abandonment of their duties on  November  endangered the safety of aircraft and the lives of their passengers, as well as of the general population, and also involved huge financial losses. The strike meant that the Civil Aeronautics Directorate could not offer its usual services in the areas of air communication, radar, radio and air traffic control for the domestic and international airlines that use them daily with the required levels of safety, efficiency, quality and speed. Furthermore, Panamanian legislation governing public servants stipulates (section  (clauses ,  and  of Act No.  of ) which applies to all state servants in accordance with section  of the Act), that the following constitute grounds for the ""immediate dismissal"" of a public servant: unjustifiably to alter, delay or refuse ... the provision of the service he usually performs, in keeping with the responsibilities of his position; ""not to be present at or not to remain at the workplace providing the service until the arrival of his replacement; to carry out or participate in strikes that are prohibited or declared illegal, or to fail to observe the requirement for essential services during legal strikes"". Moreover, the prevailing Penal Code stipulates in sections ,  and  that the following constitute offences punishable by imprisonment: ""any act which endangers the safety of air transport"" and any act which impedes or interferes with the usual operation of public services which is carried out while the official is still legally bound to perform such services. The air traffic controllers' actions were extremely detrimental to the airlines, the users and the national economy and the abandonment of their duties was entirely contrary to prevailing legislation. The Attorney-General's office is carrying out the appropriate investigation into the alleged commission of these offences (acts against means of transport and communication, conspiracy to commit an offence and abuse of authority and infringement of public servants) on the part of the air traffic controllers.
.The Government recalls also that the Committee on Freedom of Association has, in similar cases, declared that strikes may be restricted or prohibited in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) and more specifically has considered air traffic control to be an essential service. The Government concludes by pointing out that Panama has honoured and continues to honour its commitments vis--vis the Conventions it has ratified, including Conventions Nos.  and , and that in addition it is a signatory of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, adopted by way of Act No.  of  November , which imposes on the contracting States a high degree of responsibility with respect to air traffic safety, and it was this that was put under threat by the actions of the air traffic controllers.
.The Government also refers to acts which it qualifies as serious that took place in the radar control centre in Balboa on the day of the strike and which are attributable to the strikers. Specifically, they removed all instructions and information material (documents, forms, telephone books, etc.) and changed the passwords for the radar system which meant that this could not be used during the  hours following this act, endangering human lives and goods. Because of this it was not possible to carry out an air traffic control service and only basic flight information was available. The strikers' attitude gave rise to situations where there was conflict of movement in the air traffic. Moreover, from  to  November  the strikers' representatives (the leadership of APACTA) were offered a new work timetable which would allow air traffic controllers to return to work but the latter decided to continue the strike. These representatives, however, told their membership that they had no reason to go to work as they had been dismissed.
.In its communication of  October  the Government provided the following information:-- the decision not to work by public servants of the Civil Aeronautics Directorate who carry out air traffic control duties and other duties which are part of their job description in the various airports in Panama was aimed at achieving the following benefits for them as civil servants in the State's service: the passing of legislation which would regulate their career, better salaries and special retirement terms. At no time could it be considered that they were claiming union rights as, according to the national legal system, they do not fall under the standards laid down in the Labour Code. Their work and conduct falls under the standards of the Administrative Code and the law for administrative careers;-- the reason for their decision not to work was, according to their press release, to make the executive body present a Bill to achieve regulation of the career of air traffic controller, approval for a salary scale and special terms for retirement, among other things;-- the former air traffic controllers were not ""deprived"" of the right to strike because their job took place within the regulations for public servants. The Government notes that there is no conciliation and arbitration procedure to resolve conflict situations between public servants and the national Government (in this case the Civil Aeronautics Directorate as an autonomous entity of the State) in current legislation in force;-- the fact that these civil servants who were air traffic controllers decided not to carry out their duties gave rise to incidents which affected public safety (the Government refers back to information that it has already provided to the Committee);-- the former air traffic controllers ceased to carry out their duties on  November  at  a.m. and this was to continue until the Government complied with their requests.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant is objecting to the dismissal of numerous air traffic controllers who had declared a strike in order to achieve appropriate legal regulation of the working conditions of air traffic controllers following the non-promulgation of a Bill drawn up by a tripartite committee",0,1996,Panama
88,"in response to claims for improved working conditions that APACTA had been trying to establish for a number of years.
.The Committee observes that the Government stresses the following points: () that the issue related to a draft Bill; () that the tripartite committee left certain questions (salary scales and retirement provisions) pending; () that communication was still under way between the parties concerning the draft Bill; () that on  November  the Civil Aeronautics Directorate promised to reply to APACTA within one week but on the following day the air traffic controllers entirely suspended their work throughout the country; () that adoption of laws is the responsibility of the Legislative Assembly, which acts autonomously and independently to the Government; () that, given the severity of the offence committed (which is entirely contrary to prevailing legislation; which endangered the lives of the passengers and the safety of aircraft; which caused enormous damage and led to losses amounting to millions, in particular the changing of the passwords on the radar system), the sanction applied, in accordance with legislation, was the immediate dismissal of the  officials who abandoned their duties in such an untimely manner; () that air traffic control is an essential activity under national legislation wherein strikes are forbidden and that international treaties signed by Panama impose extensive obligations as far as air safety is concerned.
.The Committee has considered that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services which, if interrupted, would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) and that air traffic control is an essential service (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ). In this situation, as the complainant has not sent the additional information requested; as air traffic control is considered an essential service; taking into account that, according to the Government, during the strike the passwords to the radar system were changed; and as the air traffic controllers were offered a chance to return to work which they declined, the Committee considers that since public safety was endangered it cannot ask the Government to allow the request for a return to work of those who were fired, which was claimed by the complainant.
.The Committee notes that according to the Government there are no compensatory procedures in national legislation (for example, conciliation or arbitration) that public servants deprived of the right to strike may have recourse to should a conflict arise with their employers (in this case air traffic controllers). In this respect, the Committee recalls that ""employees deprived of the right to strike because they perform essential services must have appropriate guarantees to safeguard their interests; a corresponding denial of the right of lockout, provision of joint conciliation procedures and where, and only where, conciliation fails, the provision of joint arbitration machinery"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to introduce provisions into legislation to provide this.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Recalling that ""employees deprived of the right to strike because they perform essential services must have appropriate guarantees to safeguard their interests; a corresponding denial of the right of lockout, provision of joint conciliation procedures and where, and only where, conciliation fails, the provision of joint arbitration machinery"", the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to introduce provisions into legislation to provide this.",0,1996,Panama
89,".The National Union of Panamanian Bank Employees (SINABAN) presented a complaint of infringement of freedom of association in a letter dated  April . The Government furnished its observations in a letter dated  January .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The National Union of Panamanian Bank Employees (SINABAN) alleges in its communication of  April  that, on  September , a group of over  bank workers applied to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare for recognition of the legal status of the above-mentioned union. Since then and to this day, despite having approached all the Presidents of the Republic of Panama, no reply whatsoever has been received to this application. (The following documents were enclosed with the complaint: a record of the election of the provisional executive committee (in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Labour) on  August ; a copy of the constitution of the organisation, dated  September ; a letter to the President of the Republic, Mr. Lakas, dated  February , applying for legal status; a letter to the President of the Republic, General Omar Torrijos, dated  November , applying for legal status; a document from the Ministry of Labour (dated  September ) certifying that the National Union of Panamanian Bank Employees had applied to it for legal status on  September ; letter dated  February  to the President of the Republic, Mr. Endara, explaining the steps taken since  with a view to securing legal status for the union and requesting that this be granted.)
.The complainant organisation states that when Mr. Guillermo Endara Galimani came to power as President of the Republic, it applied to him on  February  for the granting of legal status to SINABAN but that so far no reply had been received.
.The complainant organisation adds that in December  the Banking Association of Panama (an employers' organisation in the Panamanian banking sector) began a campaign of persecution of the executive of SINABAN. On  December  the following persons were dismissed: an employee of the Banco Cafetero, Mr. Pablo San Martn (deputy general secretary of the organisation), Mr. Pablo Morn (secretary of the organisation) and Mrs. Raquel Rodrguez (trade union representative), both of whom were employed by the Chase Manhattan Bank. The complainant organisation, through the Confederation of Workers of the Panamanian Republic (to which SINABAN is affiliated), consequently requested the Social Organisations Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, in letters dated  and  February , to certify the union membership and positions held by the dismissed leaders. So far, however, the head of the Department in question refuses to deliver the attestations requested, maintaining that he has orders not to do so.
.As regards the refusal to grant legal status to the National Union of Panamanian Bank Employees, the Government, in its letter of  January , states that the Department of Social Organisations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has documents referring only to an application for the registration of a union called the ""Union of Bank Employees"", submitted on  September .
.The Government states that in accordance with sections  et seq. of the Labour Code, the Ministry of Labour has a period of  working days from the submission of an application for the registration of a trade union organisation in which to accept or reject it. It explains that if the Ministry has not taken a decision the applicants may write to the President of the Republic and that if within two months of this communication the application has not been turned down and no objections have been raised, the union is considered to have been registered. The Government states that there is no record in the Department in question of the Ministry having given a ruling, nor of the applicants having availed themselves in time of their rights under the Labour Code. Consequently, it considers that SINABAN's application has lapsed by default.
.The Government states that it respects trade union rights and the right to organise established in the laws in force and in international Conventions and that it is aware of the right of any group of workers to be recognised as a legal entity. Consequently, it states that if the group of bank workers who wish to become a representative trade union organisation of workers in the banking sector presents the Ministry of Labour with the documentation required by Panamanian law, the relevant procedure will be set in motion immediately.
.As regards the dismissed trade union leaders, the Government states that just cause had been alleged for the dismissal of Mr. Pablo Morn and Mrs. Raquel Rodrguez, who had applied to the sectional labour courts for reinstatement, considering that they enjoyed trade union immunity (""fuero sindical""). The Ministry certified that the application of the incipient union had lapsed by default, whereupon the persons concerned initiated proceedings before the Second Labour Court with the aim of determining that the union did exist and that the Ministry of Labour was refusing to recognise it. The Government adds that the labour courts turned down the applications for reinstatement, considering that the evidence produced failed to demonstrate that the workers enjoyed trade union immunity. This ruling was upheld by the Higher Labour Court. In view of these decisions, the dismissed leaders applied to the Conciliation and Decision Boards but subsequently waived their claims because they had reached an agreement whereby they received a higher sum than would have been paid to them under the law. As regards the dismissal of trade union leader Mr. Pablo San Martn, the Government states that the relevant bodies have no record of his having initiated any proceedings in a labour court.
.The Committee observes that the allegations presented by the complainant organisation refer to the following questions:(a) the refusal to grant the National Union of Panamanian Bank Employees (SINABAN) the legal status it has been claiming since ; and(b) the dismissal of trade union leaders Pablo San Martn (deputy general secretary of the organisation), an employee of the Banco Cafetero, and Raquel Rodrguez (trade union representative) and Pablo Morn (secretary of the organisation), both of whom were employed by the Chase Manhattan Bank.
.As regards the refusal to grant SINABAN the legal status it has been claiming for a number of years (-), the Committee observes that the present Government states that if the organisation presents the Ministry of Labour with the documentation required by Panamanian law, the relevant procedure will be set in motion; and that according to sections  et seq. of the Labour Code, the Ministry of Labour has a period of  working days from the submission of an application for registration in which to accept or reject it. In these circumstances, the Committee notes the Government's positive statements and suggests that the complainant organisation should once again comply with the procedure laid down in the Labour Code (apply for registration to the Ministry of Labour, enclosing authentic copies of its constitution, its approved rules and the minutes of the session or sessions at which this approval was given, etc.), and inform it of the decision taken by this body within the statutory period of  days from the new submission of the documentation. Whatever the case, the Committee regrets the fact that since , and despite having approached all the successive governments, this organisation has been unable to secure legal status. This being so, and in view of the length of time that has elapsed, the Committee requests the present Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that as soon as the new application is received from SINABAN, the Ministry of Labour will see its way clear to granting legal status within the  days specified in section  of the Labour Code. Lastly, the Committee recalls that Article  of Convention No.  provides that workers, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation. The Committee therefore requests the Government, on a more general basis, to take legislative or other measures, after consulting the tripartite body that it has established, so that trade union organisations may be registered rapidly following the completion of the relevant formalities.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of trade union leaders, the Committee notes the Government's statement that two of them came to an agreement with the enterprise and that the third has initiated no proceedings before a labour court. Nevertheless, since the Government has not indicated the specific cause underlying the dismissals, and since the union has spent  years trying to set itself up, the Committee cannot exclude the possibility that the dismissals were connected with the setting up of the union; consequently, the Committee emphasises the principle that no one should be dismissed or suffer prejudice because of their trade union",0,1991,Panama
90,"activities. The Committee requests the Government to take measures so that trade unionists who have been dismissed for activities related to the establishment of a union, be reinstated in their functions if they so wish.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deploring the fact that since  SINABAN has not been granted legal status and in view of the statement of the present Government that the complainant organisation has only to comply with the legal procedure once more to secure the grant of this status, the Committee:- suggests that the complainant organisation should once again comply with the formalities laid down in the Labour Code by applying to the Ministry of Labour;- requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that as soon as SINABAN's new application is received the Ministry of Labour will not postpone its decision regarding legal status beyond the statutory  days, and to keep it informed on developments in the matter;- requests the Government, on a more general basis, to take legislative or other measures, after consulting the tripartite body that it has established, so that trade unions may be registered rapidly following the completion of the relevant formalities.(b) The Committee reminds the Government that no one may be dismissed or suffer prejudice because of their trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to take measures so that trade unionists who have been dismissed for activities related to the establishment of a union may be reinstated in their functions, if they so wish.",-1,1991,Panama
91,".The complaints concerning the present case appear in communications from the Trade Union of Water and Electricity Board Workers (SITIRHE) dated  January and  February , from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  January , and from the Trade Union of National Telecommunications Board Workers (SITINTEL) dated  January . The Government of Panama sent its observations in communications of  February,  May and  November , and  and  January .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Trade Union of Water and Electricity Board Workers (SITIRHE) reports in its communication of  January  that the Legislative Assembly of Panama on  December  issued Act No. , eliminating trade union organisations from state enterprises. On  December, before this Act was even adopted, the head office of the Water and Electricity Board (WEB) had dismissed all trade union leaders including the General Secretary himself. Furthermore, the WEB's administration sent in troops to close and occupy the trade union's offices and premises and illegally withheld trade union dues.
.The complainant reports that the country's labour tribunals, without any legal justification, refused to receive the workers' petitions.
.Section  of Act No.  stipulates that:To maintain constitutional order, the Executive and directors of independent and semi-independent institutions, state and municipal enterprises and other public state bodies are authorised to declare void the appointments of: persons in the public services who have participated or are participating in the organisation, calling or execution of activities that threaten democracy and the constitutional order, whether or not they hold office in trade unions or associations of public servants; their trade union or sectoral delegates or representatives, the officers of the associations of public servants, irrespective of the existence of trade union immunity; and irrespective of whether they are governed by special laws.Section  stipulates that:The highest authorities of the various state bodies, such as Ministers of State, directors of independent and semi-independent institutions, state enterprises and other public bodies, the Public Prosecutor and the Administrative Prosecutor, the Comptroller-General of the Republic, governors and mayors may, having identified civil servants who participate in the actions described in article  of the present Act, declare their appointments void.Paragraph: To enforce the administrative penalty of dismissal, the Executive, through the Council of the Cabinet, shall determine whether the activity threatens democracy and the constitutional order.Section . The only recourse against the declaration that a public servant's appointment is void shall be an appeal to reconsider the case made to the authority which first handed down the decision, followed by an appeal to the next highest authority, this being the last possibility of administrative appeal.
.In its communication of  February , the SITIRHE reports that the Government took steps to ensure that the bank where the trade union has its account no longer recognises trade union leaders who have been dismissed and denies them the right to administer the union's funds.
.The SITIRHE also sent a copy of Cabinet resolution No.  of  January  regulating article  of Act No.  which defines the activities of public servants that are deemed to threaten democracy and law and order. This resolution states in article  that ""strikes and work stoppages in the public sector are a threat to democracy and the constitutional order"". Article  stipulates that any public servant who has promoted, called, organised or participated in or at any time in the future promotes, calls, organises or participates in work stoppages that are not in conformity with the procedures and restrictions established by law, or work stoppages in the public sector, shall be subject to dismissal.
.The ICFTU, in its communication of  January , explains that Act No.  authorises the summary dismissal of public sector workers accused of having participated in the organisation, calling or execution of activities threatening democracy and law and order. The Executive, through the Council of the Cabinet, is the sole body competent to define such activities. The right to appeal against dismissals under this Act is limited, and the law does not provide the normal protection for trade unionists.
.The ICFTU adds that the intent and substance of the Act is obviously directed against trade unions, as it can be applied retroactively to  December . It was on that date that the Panamanian trade union movement united to form the ""National Coordinating Committee for the Right to Life"", calling for a mass workers' demonstration so as to put pressure on the Government to accept a list of  demands it had previously rejected in October. Some , workers took part in the demonstration, at which the trade unions called a -hour general strike for the following day,  December. On the day of the strike, the Government reported an abortive coup by some members of the military. In the trade unions' view there is absolutely no proof that there really was an attempted coup or any action which might have constituted a real threat. In any case there is no link between the trade union demonstration and strike on  and  December and any military action which might have taken place. The Government, however, publicly accused the trade unions of complicity with the perpetrators of the coup attempt and of being traitors in order to discredit them and justify the subsequent denial of their fundamental rights.
.Finally, the ICFTU points out that since the adoption of Act No. , practically all trade union leaders have been dismissed in the public sector, including railways, water and electricity, communications, ports, public works and social security. The ICFTU believes these workers were dismissed because of their legitimate trade union activities, and that this is a deliberate and flagrant violation of the principles of freedom of association by the Government of Panama.
.In a communication of  January  the Trade Union of National Telecommunications Board Workers (SITINTEL) joins in the SITIRHE's complaint and encloses a list of trade unionists and workers dismissed under Act No. .
.The Government reports in a communication of  February  that the SITIRHE brought suit on  December  before the Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of Act No. , which was promulgated with the sole purpose of maintaining constitutional order and democracy.
.In a communication dated  May  the Government observes that, for the reasons appearing below, the complaint alleging that Act No.  of  December  eliminates trade union organisations from state bodies is unfounded.
.The Labour Code regulates the employment relationship in the private sector; its scope is set by article , which stipulates that the Code's provisions are part of public law and are binding on all individuals, legal entities, enterprises, undertakings and establishments operating in Panama. Public employees are governed by a separate administrative code, except where specifically covered by one of the provisions of the Code.
.The Government emphasises that under the military regime the Labour Code was extended by special laws, albeit not in its entirety, to cover the national electric, telephone, railway and port services and points out that, although the laws were promulgated by the military regime without the parliamentary and constitutional procedures of a State based on the rule of law, they still apply and the Government observes and enforces them. The Republic of Panama has not ratified the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), but each of the institutions providing the above services has its trade union. While some workers who happened to be trade union leaders were dismissed on the basis of Act No.  for actions not falling within the purview of trade union activities, the trade unions never ceased to function and to be represented, since the vacated leadership positions were filled by the union leaders, deputies and assistants who were next in line.
.The Government points out that Act No.  was issued as a provisional measure with effect up to December  for the sole purpose of maintaining constitutional order and democracy, because a movement had been formed since  October  by trade union leaders and other public servants who had dictated to the national Government a list of demands that went beyond the economic and social objectives of trade union organisations and encroached upon the Government's prerogative in matters of politics, economic management, finance, administration and social security. This irregular procedure coincided with the first attempt at subversion by some officers of the former defence forces, led by an ex-colonel and ex-chief of the national police. Despite this, a Commission of Ministers studied the list of demands and gave an appropriate written reply to each and every one. The public service trade union leaders ignored the Government's replies and called a national strike for  December , although there was no labour dispute and Panamanian law does not provide for ""strikes"" at the national level. During a march before the strike the above-mentioned",0,1991,Panama
92,"colonel, who was in detention because of the attempted revolt of  October, escaped and a military rebellion began aimed at replacing the legitimate Government by a regime imposed by force. In obvious complicity with the rebellion, the trade union leaders declared that the strike would continue until the Government fell, clearly in support of the subversive movement.
.In its communication, the Government includes statements by two witnesses, Otilio Miranda (who later reportedly retracted his statement) and Danilo Martn Toro, who link the trade union leaders in the public sector with the military rebellion and claim that the General Secretary of the SITIRHE and other trade union leaders were in telephone contact with the rebels.
.The Government adds that the Constitution imposes limits and restrictions on trade union activities in public services so as to ensure that they operate normally. Act No.  of  February , which endorsed the special legislation governing the employment relationship between the IRHE and INTEL and the persons working in these state institutions, establishes the procedure to be followed in case of labour disputes, from the initial presentation of the complaint right up to the possibility of a strike if the institution concerned does not comply with the ruling of an Arbitration Board (section  of Act No. /). Panamanian legislation does not however contain any provision regarding the ""right to strike"".
.The Government maintains in its communication that the exercise of trade union activities is still effectively protected by Panamanian legislation. Trade union immunity is observed as long as the trade unions' activities are focused on the improvement of workers' economic and social conditions (section  of the Labour Code). As such, it cannot be interpreted as a form of immunity covering any type of action, including subversion of law and order and attempts at replacing the legitimate Government by a regime imposed by force. For these reasons, the Government disagrees with the ICFTU's view that the dismissals were the result of ""legitimate trade union activities"" and that ""there is no link between the trade union demonstration"" and ""any military action which might have taken place"".
.As regards the SITIRHE's argument that its trade union offices were occupied by troops, the Government points out that in actual fact the IRHE's administration had lent the trade union some space on a temporary basis for use until it found new premises. These facilities were guarded to ensure that no acts of vandalism took place, as had occurred under the military regime. At present, unionised workers have free access to the office, its property and records, and they carry out their activities in full freedom. Furthermore, both the SITIRHE and the SITINTEL maintain that funds from union dues were illegally withheld. This is incorrect, since the INTEL and the IHRE handed over the union dues to the trade union leaders in charge of these affairs. (The Government attached copies of deposit slips for SITINTEL union dues.)
.The Government denies the allegation that the authorities interfered in the management of the IRHE trade union funds. The IRHE's director merely gave the bank where the union funds were kept the names of those trade union leaders who had been discharged and of those who were still in their jobs, so that the union's accounts could be administered in conformity with the law (i.e. by those who had not been discharged). The Government gives the assurance that it respects fully the right of trade unions to manage their funds freely and independently.
.As regards the assertion that the country's labour tribunals refused to receive the workers' list of demands without any legal justification, the Government states in its communications dated  November  and  January  that  complaints of dismissal have been brought against the IRHE and INTEL before the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court. The Government also points out that  IRHE workers dismissed under Act No.  of  who requested Conciliation Board No.  to reinstate them in their jobs had dropped their cases. The Government adds that the complainant organisations are wrong to claim that Act No.  of  restricts public workers' complaints to administrative channels, since dismissed workers may appeal to the authority which took the measure and to the higher administrative authority, i.e. the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, which is the highest labour authority. As regards the dismissal of IRHE and INTEL workers, the Government states that  of the  IRHE dismissed workers and ten of the  INTEL dismissed workers were reinstated on administrative appeal.
.Finally, regarding the claim that Act No.  is unconstitutional, the Government states that the Supreme Court declared that the Act was constitutional and, as such, legitimate and valid.
.The Committee observes that the allegations made by the complainant organisations concern the following:(a) the mass dismissal of trade union leaders and workers in the public sector (railways, water, electricity, communications, public works, ports, etc.) because of the strike of  December . According to the allegations, Act No.  of  December  and Cabinet Resolution No.  provide that the Executives and administrations of state agencies may declare void the appointments of public servants whether or not they hold office in trade unions if they participate or have participated in activities that threaten democracy and the constitutional order, including ""strikes and work stoppages in the public sector"";(b) the occupation of the SITIRHE's (electricity) premises by the military; and(c) the intervention of the Government in the administration of trade union funds, preventing the trade union leaders (who had been dismissed en masse) from administering those funds and thus freezing union dues.
.As regards the alleged mass dismissal under Act No.  and Cabinet Resolution No.  of trade union leaders in the public sector (the complainant organisations list  names) and of workers in the same sector ( names), the Committee observes that the Government states:
.The Committee takes due note of the arguments invoked by the Government. None the less, the Committee must observe that:
.() finally, from the legislative point of view, the following must be emphasised:- with the exception of very isolated cases (the Electricity Trade Union and the Telecommunications Trade Union) civil servants and workers in the public sector, under the national legislation, are denied the right to establish trade unions and other trade union rights;- the Committee of Experts has emphasised for several years now that civil servants and workers in the public sector should be granted union rights;- at its March  meeting the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations requested the Government to take measures with a view to repealing Act No. , under which mass dismissals had taken place, in light of the fact that the Act greatly prejudices the exercise of the right of associations of public employees to organise their activities;- in the view of the Committee, the expression ""threatens democracy and constitutional order"" in Act No.  and in Cabinet Resolution No. , under which the dismissals took place, is excessively vague and may lend itself to abuse.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the mass dismissal of trade union leaders and workers in the public sector was a serious violation of Convention No. . The Committee therefore urges the Government to take measures with a view to reinstating the trade union leaders and the workers still dismissed, inasmuch as this can only contribute to restoring normal and harmonious labour relations. In any event, the Committee further requests the Government to keep it informed of developments and of the outcome in the dismissed workers' cases now before the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court. The Committee likewise requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that the law embodies the right for civil servants and workers in the public sector to organise trade unions and all other trade union rights recognised in Conventions Nos.  and .As regards the allegation that the SITIRHE's premises were occupied by the military, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that there is now free access to the premises and that these facilities were guarded to ensure that no acts of vandalism took place there, as reportedly had occurred under the military regime. The Committee reminds the Government that an indispensable corollary of the inviolability of trade union premises is that the public authorities may not insist on entering premises without a judicial warrant authorising them to do so, a warrant which did not figure in this case (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , paras.  and ), and that otherwise there is the risk of serious interference by the authorities in trade union activities.
.As regards the allegation that the SITIRHE's premises were occupied by the military, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that there is now free access to the premises and that these facilities were guarded to ensure that no acts of vandalism took place there, as reportedly had occurred under the military regime. The Committee reminds the",0,1991,Panama
93,"Government that an indispensable corollary of the inviolability of trade union premises is that the public authorities may not insist on entering premises without a judicial warrant authorising them to do so, a warrant which did not figure in this case (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , paras.  and ), and that otherwise there is the risk of serious interference by the authorities in trade union activities.
.As regards the allegation that the Government is freezing the SITIRHE's trade union funds and keeping dismissed trade union leaders from having access to and administering trade union dues, the Committee observes that this freeze resulted from the dismissal of trade union leaders who thus lacked the legal authority to administer the funds. The Committee emphasises that the dismissal of a trade union leader should not prevent him or her from exercising trade union activities during his or her mandate, and considers that the administration of trade union funds should be carried out by the leaders designated in accordance with the trade union's by-laws and without any interference whatsoever. It is for the union members themselves to decide whether the leaders should keep managing the funds of the organisation. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take measures to that effect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the mass dismissal of trade union leaders and workers in the public sector on account of the strike of  December , the Committee urges the Government to continue taking measures with a view to reinstating the trade union leaders and workers who are still dismissed, and to keep it informed of the dismissed workers' cases now under consideration.(b) Likewise, the Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that the law embodies the right of civil servants and workers in the public sector to organise, and all other trade union rights recognised by Conventions Nos.  and .(c) The Committee urges the Government fully to respect in future the principle that an indispensable corollary of the inviolability of trade union premises is that the public authorities may not insist on entering premises without a judicial warrant authorising them to do so.(d) The Committee requests the Government to allow the SITIRHE's trade union leaders to have access to and to administer trade union dues, in accordance with the trade union's by-laws and without any interference whatsoever.",1,1991,Panama
94,".The case was examined by the Committee at its meeting in May , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )). Subsequently, the Government provided its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the allegations of massive dismissals in the public sector, the Committee observes that according to the Government no dismissal was connected with the exercise of legitimate trade union activities and that the dismissals which took place concerned public employees who, protected by the military regime, had engaged in activities of persecution, repression, threats, harassment, the destruction and theft of public and private property, and arms trafficking, or who in other notorious ways had undermined the dignity and human rights of their workmates and of other Panamanian or foreign citizens. Since the Government's version conflicts with that of the complainants, who maintain that the majority of the , dismissals were arbitrary, unjustified and without grounds, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary action, so that the tripartite committee which was set up under the agreement signed on  December  for the purpose of consultations on social and labour matters, examine and remedy all dismissals that may have been motivated by the trade union function or activities of the officials and employees concerned. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the matter.
.As regards the other alleged dismissals, the Committee notes that trade union leader Mrs. Lourdes Salazar withdrew the reinstatement proceedings she had initiated against Greenbay Overseas International Inc. and that Mrs. Mirna Marquez signed an agreement with Jenny Manufacturing Inc., signifying that the employment relationship was terminated. Similarly, the Committee observes that the dismissal of Mrs. Gisela Cedeo by Jenny Manufacturing Inc. was confirmed by three courts, which indicated in their rulings that this worker had refused to carry out tasks stipulated in her contract of employment although these were tasks that she had undertaken on previous occasions. In the circumstances, the Committee considers that there is no point in pursuing its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary action so that the tripartite committee, set up under the agreement of  December  for the purpose of holding consultations on social and labour matters, examine and remedy all dismissals that may have been motivated by the trade union function or activities of the officials and employees concerned, and to keep it informed on the matter.
.The complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) is contained in communications dated  April and  August . The Government supplied its observations on the allegations made in this case in communications dated  August ,  January and  February .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  April , the ICFTU alleges the infringement of Conventions Nos.  and  by the Government of Panama. It points out that in recent months Panama has been experiencing a profound social and economic crisis, the principal victims of which have been the workers, and that for this reason the ICFTU organised, in collaboration with its affiliate for the American region, the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers (ORIT), a mission to this country to gather on-the-spot information on the acts which have been the subject of repeated denunciations by its affiliate, the Confederation of Workers of the Republic of Panama (CTRP) and other trade union organisations.
.The ICFTU points out that during this mission the delegation was able to observe the existence of government practices which constantly threaten the stability of employment and the rights of workers and their organisations, with a marked increase in repression against public employees, as can be seen from the following:- Threats and acts of repression against leaders and workers of the National Federation of Associations and Organisations of Public Employees (FENASEP) in violation of the rights enshrined in the laws of the Republic and the Constitution of the country.- Searching and closing of premises of the organisations by administrative order, very often in the presence of armed authorities who have arrested and intimidated officials and workers.- Waging of a systematic campaign against employees' associations through the dismissal of their leaders and the massive dismissals of workers. Campaign of intimidation to pressure workers into relinquishing membership in their organisations.- Dismissal of more than , workers, in most cases in an arbitrary and unjustified manner, since the new Government came to power. These dismissals have, in general, been made orally, without giving any grounds for dismissal; illegal withholding of workers' wages.- Dismissals in the public sector: the Panamanian trade union movement has been accused of having supported the previous regime and of having formed part of the so-called ""dignity batallions"". It is on the basis of this abusive accusation that the Government obtained approval of Cabinet Decree No. , dated  December , which authorises dismissals in the public sector at the simple discretion of the employer. This repressive and retrograde Decree repealed Executive Decree No. , dated  October , which granted stability of employment to public employees; as a result of these new measures, , State workers have been left completely unprotected and, irrespective of their seniority, are now considered temporary workers.- House searches and illegal detention of the trade union officials Hctor Alemn, Juan Antonio Samudio and Sal Quirz and who have been kept incommunicado simply because they have defended the interests of workers.- Massive arrests of leaders of associations and of FENASEP chapters in the provinces.- Campaign by the Government's communication media to discredit Hctor Alemn, a trade union official and labour adviser who was unable to refute the accusations since the Government provisions prohibit the right of reply.
.The ICFTU goes on to point out that the trade union movement has been seriously affected by the economic crisis, which has reduced the size of its membership and limited the organisations' resources, leading them to the brink of financial disaster.
.The ICFTU communicates a list of employees and trade union officials of public bodies and their organisations who have been dismissed recently. The list contains the names of more than , workers and some  trade union officials as well as accusations of wage deductions, delays in the payment of benefits and other allegations.
.In its communication dated  August , the ICFTU points out that in accordance with the information provided by the National Union of Workers of Textile Fibre, Sewing and Leather Products of Panama (SINATRAPROFITECC), two enterprises - Greenbay Overseas International Inc. and Jenny Manufacturing Inc. - apply discriminatory and anti-trade union policies against their employees. In recent months, a number of workers have been dismissed without justification, in violation of Cabinet Decree No. , dated  January , and the Panamanian Labour Code, as well the principles of freedom of association. Furthermore, these enterprises have tried to prevent the workers from appealing to the Ministry of Labour to ensure respect for their rights.
.The ICFTU adds that on  April , Lourdes Salazar, Secretary General of the Union of Workers in the Greenbay Overseas International Inc. enterprise - situated in the industrial free zone of Coln - was dismissed and removed from her workplace by the security staff, and that she has not been reinstated. In the same way, on  May , SINATRAPROFITECC called a general meeting of workers in the Jenny Manufacturing Inc. enterprise at the trade union headquarters, and the undertaking obliged workers to work overtime to prevent them from attending the meeting. The few employees who were able to attend the meeting included the chiefs of production, the chief of personnel and administrative employees who spoke out against the trade union and its officials. Similar attacks have been made through pamphlets, bulletins and other means of communication. The ICFTU concludes by pointing out that the trade union has not been able to make an effective protest because of the constant pressure exercised by the enterprises concerned and because, as the Ministry of Labour pointed out to SINATRAPROFITECC, ""things are not the same as before"".
.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that following the events which occurred in December , some trade union officials were arrested on suspicion of having been involved in unlawful acts. This was the case of the leaders Hctor Alemn, Juan Antonio Samudio, Sal Quirz and other officials of the National Federation of Public Servants (FENASEP) from the country's interior mentioned by the complainant. The Government states that there are no trade union officials under arrest in",0,1990,Panama
95,"the country, and that it would subsequently reply to each of the alleged violations of freedom of association of which it is accused.
.In another communication dated  February , concerning the alleged government practices against public employees, the Government states that Cabinet Decree No. , dated  December  ""to stabilise the organisation of State dependencies"" authorized the Ministers of State, directors of autonomous bodies, the Attorney-General of the Republic and the Chief of Administration, the Comptroller General of the Republic, governors, mayors and other higher authorities to declare null and void the appointments of certain public servants. The public servants involved were those who, over the last  months and under the protection offered by the dictatorship, had carried out acts of persecution, repression, threat, harassment, destruction and stealing of public and private property, introduced arms into the country or engaged in arms traffic, or who in any other notorious manner had violated the dignity and human rights of their fellow workers and any other Panamanian or foreign citizens. The above-mentioned Decree clearly sets forth its objective by pointing out that its adoption is the result of the alarming manner which in recent years public servants, although obliged to observe the fundamental guarantees established by article  of the Constitution of the Republic of Panama to protect the lives, good name and property of nationals wherever they may be, and of foreign nationals on the national territory, have clearly taken it upon themselves to disregard these principles. Furthermore, public servants, under the protection offered by the dictatorial power, organised paramilitary groups known as the CODEPADI and ""dignity batallions"", and other terrorist activities, in an attempt to sabotage the organisation of its institutions, the peace and safety of their fellow workers and even destroyed or withheld archives, documents, equipment and other property belonging to the State. The preamble of Decree No.  incorporates the provisions of article  of the national Constitution, which make the stability of employment of public officials conditional upon their competence, loyalty and integrity in their service.
.Furthermore, the communication from the Government points out that it is important to emphasise that public officials are not protected by the Labour Code and have not enjoyed stability of employment for a number of years. This was due to the fact that the dictatorial regime had repealed the provisions respecting administrative careers established by the government based on the rule of law prior to the  coup d'tat. At present, public officials may be appointed and freely removed by the executive body, with exception of those covered by special laws. In this connection the Labour Code provides:""Section : the provisions of this Code are of a public order and are incumbent upon all persons, whether natural or legal, enterprises, works or establishments which are or may be established on the national territory.Public employees are subject to the regulations governing administrative careers except in cases where express provision has been made for the application of some principle of this Code to such employees.""
.The communication from the Government points out that public officials have not been dismissed in an arbitrary and illegal manner as the ICFTU alleges in its complaint. Furthermore, those officials who believe that their dismissal is unjustified may seek redress through the respective legal procedures, and indeed in some cases such procedures have been initiated.
.As regards the detention of certain trade union officials, the Government reports that the Attorney-General of the Nation stated, in note DLPG/ dated  June , that there are no trade union officials under arrest and that the Panamanian authorities have not searched or closed the premises of FENASEP.
.Furthermore, the Government firmly denies the allegation that the trade union leader Hctor Alemn has been discredited by the government-controlled mass media, and that he has not been able to refute the accusations because governmental provisions prohibit the right of reply. No legal provisions have been issued prohibiting the right of reply; on the contrary, the new Government has given special attention to freedom of expression which was finally restored after more than  years of absolute control by the dictatorship. Mr. Alemn, despite his activities as a politician with links to the deposed regime, enjoys the climate of freedom which is guaranteed by the democratic Government.
.As regards the statement that the trade union movement has been affected by the economic crisis, which has reduced the number of its members and limited organisations' resources and led them almost to the brink of financial disaster, this is a situation regretted by the national Government. The Government is making every effort to find effective ways of resolving the economic crisis which is affecting not only the trade union movement, but all sectors of the country, and which is the result of the many errors committed by the dictatorship during its mismanagement of the country, a mismanagement characterised by corruption and the misuse of public funds.
.The Government explains that after the pillaging and vandalism committed by the CODEPADI and ""dignity batallions"" following the fall of the dictatorship in the country, more than  commercial establishments lost all or part of their assets, with thousands of workers being left without their jobs, an unprecedented event in the life of the country. Obviously, for the new Government, urgent attention had to be given to the dramatic situation affecting thousands of workers in the streets, near the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, where work centres had been pillaged and destroyed and whose owners were faced with the loss of their businesses. Labour legislation establishes as a justified cause for terminating an employment relationship - without giving rise to any legal liability on the part of the employer - force majeure or a fortuitous event, the necessary, immediate and direct consequence of which is the complete paralysis of the employers' activities. In these circumstances, the Ministry of Labour immediately tried to bring the parties together to find solutions which would help the employers concerned to manage their financial resources, to restart their businesses and to reopen their establishments and thus avoid the massive dismissal of workers. To this end Decrees Nos.  and , dated  and  January , respectively, were presented to the Cabinet Council for consideration and approval; they extended the time periods for the suspension of the effects of contracts of employment, made dismissal on the above-mentioned ground subject to the prior authorisation of the Ministry of Labour and urged the parties to negotiate temporary agreements on working conditions, subject to the approval of the Ministry, to overcome the critical situation without placing further burdens on the parties concerned.
.The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, whose installations, equipment and furniture was also affected by the pillaging and vandalism and whose structure was modified by the necessary changes in Government, made every effort to reconcile the interests of the parties, with satisfactory results, since at present most of the establishments concerned have reopened and employ more than  per cent of their workforce, whereas others will shortly be reopening. The situation, however, remains uncertain as regards one or two establishments where the Ministry is studying the situation as regards the benefits and rights of the workers.
.The ICFTU also alleges that the Directorate General of Labour is obstructing trade union activities by establishing a series of requirements which are not included in section  of the Labour Code. In this respect the Government believes it is important to point out that the Directorate General of Labour has merely requested trade unions and other social organisations to update the list of their members, since most of these lists cover more than the one-year period stipulated by section (), mentioned above. The information required for the identification of members is as follows: name, number of identity card, affiliation, name of workplace and social security number. The sole purpose of this requirement is to update efficiently the lists of members of social organisations and there has never been any attempt to obstruct trade union activities.
.In subsequent allegations, the ICFTU provided information from the National Union of Workers of Textile Fibre, Sewing and Leather Products of Panama (SINATRAPROFITECC), alleging discriminatory and anti-trade union policies in the Greenbay Overseas International Inc. and Jenny Manufacturing Inc. enterprises. As regards Greenbay Overseas International Inc., the Government states that the workers made a request to the Department of Social Organisation of the Ministry, dated  March , to establish a trade union, but since they did not meet the formal requirements established by law, their documentation was returned to them on  April of the same year, at which time they ceased to benefit from trade union immunity (fuero sindical). At the end of April, seven workers were dismissed who were members of the provisional executive committee but who at that time did not enjoy trade union protection. Subsequently, and following the respective appeals, six were reinstated. On  May  another request was made for the establishment of a trade union, and observations were made which had",-1,1990,Panama
96,"to be implemented within  days. On  June, the documentation was returned, within the time-limit established by the law, and once again on  July another request was made. It is important to note that following the reception of the request, the following were appended to the file:
.The Government points out that given all these irregularities it was decided to carry out a ballot to determine the number of workers who wanted to establish a trade union. The count was held on  August , following the presentation of resignations and documents, and was carried out in an objective manner. Ballot papers were distributed individually, explanations were given to workers concerning the writing of their names and the number of their identity card and whether they wanted a trade union or not. The vote was carried out in an orderly fashion, without pressure, intimidation or incidents. Workers were not subjected to any harassment or coercion. The result of the count was as follows:
.As regards the dismissals in the Jenny Manufacturing Inc. enterprise, the Government states that by resolution  DT , the Directorate General of Labour ordered the enterprise to reinstate the workers and pay them their wages. However, the employer filed a complaint on the ground of the unconstitutional nature of this resolution and the file was passed on to the Supreme Court of Justice on  September .
.The Committee notes that the allegations made in this case concern events which followed a change of regime in exceptional circumstances in December . The allegations refer to alleged harassment and pressure by the Government against public employees by means of threats, arrests, repressions, the searching and closing of trade union premises and the unjustified dismissal of trade union leaders in the public sector on the basis of a Cabinet Decree. In addition, other allegations refer to the discriminatory anti-trade union policies of two enterprises situated in the free zone of Coln.
.The Committee takes note of the detailed information provided by the Government on the allegations made in this case.
.As regards the allegation that government practices infringe the trade union rights of workers in the public sector by means of massive dismissals of workers and union officials in the sector, based on Cabinet Decree No. , the Committee requests the Government to supply precise information so as to enable the Committee to determine whether or not these dismissals were based on the trade union membership or activities of those involved.
.As regards the allegations concerning threats against trade union leaders, the searching and closing down of trade union premises and the supposed campaigns of intimidation against employees' associations, the Committee recalls that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. (See th Report, Case No.  (Brazil), para. .) Furthermore, as regards the searching of trade union premises, it recalls that the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session () stipulates that the right to the protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.As regards the detention of the trade union leaders Hctor Alemn, Juan Antonio Samudio and Sal Quirz and other officials of FENASEP in the interior of the country, the Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government that as a result of the events which occurred in December , several trade union leaders were arrested on suspicion of having been involved in unlawful acts, but that at present no trade union leaders are under arrest. In this respect, the Committee would like to point out that the detention of trade union leaders without specific criminal charges against them involves restrictions on trade union rights (see in this respect, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).
.As regards the allegation that two enterprises of the industrial free zone of Coln - Greenbay Overseas International Inc. and Jenny Manufacturing Inc. - are carrying out acts of anti-union discrimination by preventing the holding of trade union meetings and organising a campaign against the trade unions of the undertakings, as well as ordering the dismissal and forced removal from her workplace of the trade union leader Lourdes Salazar, the Committee notes the explanation provided by the Government in this respect, in particular concerning the ballot carried out in one of these undertakings. The Committee considers that this ballot system was not in itself contrary to the principles of freedom of association. It recalls, nevertheless, that the formalities prescribed by legislation regarding the establishment of trade unions should not be applied in such a way that they delay or impede the formation of organisations, as apparently was the case with the request made by the incipient trade union at Greenbay Overseas International Inc., which resulted in the dismissal of the seven members of the provisional executive committee of the trade union without their being able to benefit from trade union immunity (fuero sindical).
.Although the Committee notes that six of the seven trade union officials dismissed have been reinstated, it requests the Government to inform it of the events which led to the dismissal of the trade union leader Lourdes Salazar, and whether she has been reinstated or whether she initiated any kind of judicial proceedings to this end. Likewise, it requests the Government to inform it of the results of the judicial proceedings for reinstatement initiated by workers dismissed from Jenny Manufacturing Inc. and the appeal regarding unconstitutionality lodged by this enterprise on  September .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)The Committee observes that the allegations in this case concern events which followed a change of regime in exceptional circumstances in December .(b)As concerns the allegation of massive dismissals in the public sector, the Committee requests the Government to supply precise information in this respect so as to enable the Committee to determine whether or not these dismissals were based on the trade union membership or activities of those involved.(c)As regards the allegations concerning threats against trade union leaders, the searching and closing down of trade union premises and campaigns of intimidation against employees' associations, the Committee recalls that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. Furthermore, as regards the searching of trade union premises, it recalls the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), which stipulates that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee therefore urges the Government fully to apply these principles.(d)As regards the dismissal and forced removal from her workplace of the trade union leader Lourdes Salazar, the Committee asks the Government to inform it of the events which led to the dismissal of this official and whether she has been reinstated in her workplace, or has initiated any kind of judicial proceedings for this purpose. The Committee also asks the Government to inform it of the results of the proceedings for reinstatement initiated by workers who were dismissed from Jenny Manufacturing Inc. and the appeal regarding unconstitutionality lodged by this enterprise on  September .(e)As regards the allegations of acts of anti-union discrimination, the preventing of the holding of trade union meetings of an incipient trade union and anti-trade union campaigns, the Committee recalls that the formalities prescribed by legislation for the establishment of a trade union should not be applied in such a way as to delay or impede the formation of organisations, as apparently was the case with the request made by the incipient trade union at Greenbay Overseas International Inc., which resulted in the dismissal of seven members of the provisional executive committee of the union who were not covered by trade union immunity.",-1,1990,Panama
97,".The Committee examined this case at its May  meeting and submitted an interim report (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June )). The previous Government sent its observations in communications dated  August and  October , and the present Government in communications dated  February and  April .
.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisations alleged in their complaint that as a result of strikes held in the electricity sector to obtain wage increases and better working conditions, the authorities had detained four officers and  members of the Trade Union of Water and Electricity Board Workers (SITIRHE), searched and closed the trade union premises, confiscated trade union funds and arbitrarily dismissed  officers and  workers. When the Committee examined the case at its May  meeting, it reached the following conclusions and recommendations (see th Report, paras. -):
.As regards the detention of four trade union officials and  trade unionists, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the Government's and the complainants' accounts of the grounds for these detentions. According to the Government's reply, the arrests occurred because common law crimes had been committed and mainly because the electricity supply had been cut off without warning throughout the country for  hours; furthermore, this action had been accompanied by acts of sabotage and had had political objectives because on the same day there had been an attempted military coup by a colonel who was in permanent contact with the secretary-general of the SITIRHE. On the other hand, the complainant organisations allege that trade union officials and trade unionists in the elctricity sector were arrested because they had taken part in a strike to obtain wage increases and better working conditions. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the strike in the electricity sector was legal on the day the supply of electricity was cut off because, although the Labour Code authorises strikes in the electricity sector - provided that notice is given and that a minimum service is maintained (sections  and ) - the Government pointed out that on  and  March  the Cabinet had issued Decrees banning strikes in this sector. However, the Government did not send copies of these Decrees; neither did it provide information on the reasons why the general regulations on strikes were amended with respect to the electricity sector.
.In view of the marked contradictions between the allegations and the Government's reply and the lack of information on several points, the Committee feels that it has not been presented with enough information to reach a conclusion on the allegations concerning the arrests of trade union officials and trade unionists. Consequently, noting that the four trade union officials in question are on bail (one of them is in exile in a foreign country) and that proceedings against them are under way, the Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the judgement handed down in this case. The Committee also requests the Government to provide details on the stage of the proceedings against the other  trade unionists who were arrested, to mention whether they have been released and to provide the text of the judgement that might be handed down in their case.
.Finally, the Committee regrets to note that the Government failed to reply to the other allegations (the searching and closure of the premises of the SITIRHE, the confiscation of its funds and the arbitrary arrest of  trade union officials - the Government only referred to the dismissal of the official Isaac Rodrguez - and of  workers). The Committee therefore requests the Government to reply to these allegations.
.In its February  report, the Committee noted that the new Government had sent, in a communication dated  February , certain observations concerning the case and had stated that it would send new information, pointing out that, because of the destruction of certain public offices during the fall of the previous regime, it had not been possible to obtain all of the information requested; the Committee stated that it hoped to receive this information shortly (see th Report, para. ).
.The Government repeats that the reasons underlying the arrest of trade union officials and members had nothing to do with trade union organisation and related to actions defined as offences against collective security and against the internal and juridical integrity of the State, such as abuse of authority and usurpation of public office. None of the actions committed by the officers of the trade union of the Water and Electricity Board (IRHE) were aimed at obtaining an increase in wages or satisfaction of labour demands.
.The Government adds that before the events occurred, in view of the serious situation in the country, it had declared a state of emergency throughout the national territory by Decree No.  of  March . In this context, the activities of certain government institutions were declared essential to national security in order to avert serious disruption of public order endangering the health and safety of most of the population (Decree No.  of March ); these activities included those carried out by the Water and Electricity Board (IRHE). Under Decree No.  of March , workers employed in such services shall be liable to suspension and even dismissal if they discontinue work without just cause and without declaring a strike, endangering the provision of the service to the community. This does not, however, constitute a prohibition of the exercise of the right to strike.
.Regarding the alleged search and closure of the trade union premises and the confiscation of its funds, the Government states that a group of trade union members lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare concerning misuse of trade union funds and infringement of the trade union by-laws and electoral regulations. For this reason, the General Labour Directorate appointed an official to carry out an audit, which confirmed irregularities such as considerable disbursements without the necessary receipts, and cheques paid without the due authorisation of the trade union's general assembly. There had been no confiscation of the funds, contrary to the complainant organisations' allegations, but only supervision carried out by an official who authorised withdrawal of the funds until the investigation was completed and responsibilities determined, in order to ensure the correct management of the funds in the interests of all of the members.
.As regards the search and closure referred to in the complainants' allegations, the Government states that due to lack of information as to the whereabouts of the officers of the SITIRHE, and of its General Secretary, Mr. Isaac Rodrguez, and since it was impossible to carry out an audit as the organisation's premises were locked, Order No. -DGT was issued granting access to the SITIRHE premises to the trade union auditors of the Ministry of Labour and to labour inspectors, accompanied by a notary, for the sole purpose of obtaining from the trade union's accounts the information necessary for the audit, the conduct of which can be attested to by the notary. Once the examination had been carried out in accordance with the resolution ordering the supervision of the trade union funds, the premises were closed and the keys handed over to the Director-General of the IRHE. In view of the above, the Government feels it must be made clear that it is not true that the premises containing the headquarters of the executive committee of the SITIRHE were searched, much less sealed, because it had been necessary to carry out an inspection and an audit of the accounts, which were in the trade union premises and these premises had been abandoned by the trade union officers and summonses had been issued by the authorities for infringements denounced by a group of members of that trade union and for embezzlement of trade union funds.
.As regards the situation of the detained trade union officers and members, the Government states that none of the four trade union officers was detained, although there were sufficient grounds to place them in preventive detention despite the fact that the preliminary investigation had not been completed. Work has not been completed on the investigation into how the legal representatives of the trade unions used the resources provided for by law for the better defence of the workers they represent. Once the preliminary investigation has been completed, it will be referred to the competent judicial authority.
.As regards the alleged detention of  members of the Trade Union of Water and Electricity Board Workers (SITIRHE), the Government states that these persons had been required to deposit a statement as part of the current preliminary inquiries into the offences under investigation with a view to ascertaining whether they had participated in them. They had been released after making their statements. In the case of employees of the",-1,1988,Panama
98,"IRHE who committed offences in carrying out their functions, their situation will be determined in the judicial decisions which will be handed down by the competent courts.
.As regards the allegations of arbitrary dismissal of  trade union officers and  workers, the Government states that at the beginning of September , the trade union officers, without carrying out the necessary legal formalities, called for a stoppage of work. The stoppage was referred to as ""permanent session"", and was intended from that time on, despite the state of emergency, to discontinue the service, and hence the supply of electricity to the entire country until they obtained the payment of the second part of the benefit known as the th month, and the revocation of the dismissals of some workers whose employment relationship had been terminated on disciplinary grounds. Despite the management's efforts to get them to desist and although an agreement had been reached on payment of the th month, which was the main issue of the dispute, many of the workers refused to go back to their posts, and legal action was accordingly taken against them for absence without just cause.
.As regards the trade union officials referred to in the complainants' allegations, although they were protected by trade union immunity, the procedure laid down in labour law was resorted to, according to which authorisation of dismissal is requested from the divisional labour courts which are competent to assess the conduct of each of the workers concerned. It must be pointed out that each of the workers was afforded the procedural guarantees applicable. On the other hand, it is obvious that the outcome of such proceedings directly depends on how the workers' representatives exercise their right to legal appeal in the defence and in the interests of the workers they represent. The Government encloses a copy of the judgement of the Supreme Court upholding the ruling of the High Labour Court authorising the dismissal for just cause of trade union officer Isaac Rodrguez (""deliberately causing material damage to objects directly related to work"", just cause for dismissal as laid down in section  of Act No.  of  February ).
.In its communications dated  February and  April , the Government states that, as is well known,  December  marked the inauguration in Panama of the Democratic Government of National Reconstruction and Reconciliation, presided over by His Excellency President Guillermo Endara Galimany, elected by the Panamanian people in elections held on  May . The present national Government has committed itself publicly before this country and before the international community to respect the fundamental guarantees laid down in the Constitution of the Republic of Panama which, in Chapter  of Title III, guarantees the full exercise of the individual and social rights and duties of Panamanians. This commitment is reflected in the major efforts undertaken by the national Government to remedy the errors committed by the previous regime. Therefore the reasons for the complaints contained in the cases before the Committee on Freedom of Association ceased to exist with the establishment of the present lawful regime.
.The Government states further that as of  January  the orders to close down the premises of the Trade Union of Water and Electricity Board Workers (SITIRHE) and those for the detention and suspension of the persons referred to by the complainants have been rescinded, so that the latter were able to resume their duties. The Goverment adds that pending the trade union elections to take place on  April  the management of the SITIRHE funds has been entrusted to its former executive committee (whose term of office had expired in November ), subject to verification by an official of the Ministry of Labour. The Government states further that the auditing of the trade union's funds has been completed and that all the documents have been returned to its executive committee.
.The Committee notes the inauguration of a new Government in Panama on  December . It notes with satisfaction the measures adopted subsequently by the authorities rescinding the orders for detention and dismissal against the trade union officers and members of the SITIRHE and returning their premises and property to them, thus settling all of the issues pending.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee notes with satisfaction the measures adopted by the present Government in relation to workers' organisations and their leaders, which bring an end to the very serious violations of Conventions Nos.  and , which had occurred during the previous Government.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the InternationalConfederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  October . The LatinAmerican Central of Workers (CLAT) presented its complaint in a communicationdated  January , supported by a letter dated  January  from theWorld Confederation of Labour (WCL). The Government replied in communicationsdated  February and  April .
.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection ofthe Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise andCollective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU alleges that on  September, three members of the Executiveof the Trade Union of Water and Electricity Board Workers (SITIRHE) werearrested, as they were considered subversive elements for having organisedsuccessive strikes to obtain wage increases and better working conditions. Thetrade unionists affected by these arbitrary measures are Fernando del RoGaona (supervisor of electric cables, organisational secretary and formersecretary-general of the trade union), Luis Enrique Hurtado Jaramillo (civilengineer and press and publicity secretary of the trade union) and Angel JulioCorvaln Snchez (unions' defence and labour under-secretary of the tradeunion).
.The ICFTU adds that previously, on  August , Isaac Rodrguez,Secretary-General of the same trade union (SITIRHE), was arrested; he wasseverely beaten during his detention.
.Furthermore, in connection with the same occurrences, the CLAT and theWCL allege in their communications of  and  January  that theauthorities intervened following legitimate claims decided upon democraticallyby the workers grouped together in the Trade Union of Water and ElectricityBoard Workers (SITIRHE). This resulted in the premises of the trade unionbeing searched and closed by the national guard and the trade union fundsconfiscated; some  workers and  officials were arbitrarily dismissed andmore than  members of the trade union arrested. This gave rise to apermanent persecution campaign against the trade union officials, and thesecretary-general of the organisation has been in exile in Spain sinceNovember . The WCL and CLAT point out that the trade union officials,Messrs. Fernando del Ro, Hurtado and Corvaln were arrested and subsequentlyreleased.B. The Government's reply
.In its communication of  February , the Government states thatthe allegations concerning the arrest of the above-mentioned trade unionofficials are totally devoid of truth, since they disclaim any link betweenthese persons with the criminal offences committed that seriously endangeredcollective security and the internal integrity of the State. These eventsoccurred during violent actions, which were mainly instigated by organisationsof a political nature in their attempt to bring about a change in theconstitutionally established order.
.The Government points out that the consequences of these criminalactions were of such magnitude that the electric power supply was totally cutoff throughout the Republic for more than  hours; this was due to criminalacts of sabotage and caused irreparable damage - even loss of life. Therespective inquiries determined that Messrs. Isaac Rodrguez, del Ro, Hurtadoand Corvaln were unequivocably linked with these crimes and, consequently,the investigating official ordered their preventive detention in accordancewith the standards laid down in the Penal Code. Indeed, section  of thePenal Code deals with the standards transgressed; it states that ""a person whodamages or puts out of action pipes, dams or other devices designed forirrigation, conveying water and producing or carrying electricity or othersources of energy shall be punished by imprisonment of three to eight years.If the death of one or several persons is caused by the actions describedabove, the penalty provided for under section  o)shall apply"".
.The Government also adds that Messrs. Rodrguez, del Ro, Hurtado andCorvaln, taking advantage of their position as trade union officials, wereinvolved in promoting and conducting political activities, thus flouting basicobjectives to bring about the good of workers as a whole - and committedcrimes against the internal integrity of the State. However, the Governmentstates that the investigating official, who is at present entrusted withcarrying out inquiries into this case, released these persons, although theseinquiries have not yet ended.
.In its communication of  April , the Government gives thefollowing account of the events: on  March , Isaac Rodrguez,Secretary-General of the Trade Union of Water and Electricity Board Workers(SITIRHE), gave the order through the Board's radio, together with other tradeunion officials and members, to shut down all the electricity power stations,thus leaving the entire country without electricity for  hours. Thefollowing day, there was a tripartite meeting at which the SITIRHE agreed togive the order to restore electricity but this was not carried out since itwas necessary to call upon technical staff not working in the electricitypower stations; this caused a delay of up",-1,1988,Panama
99,"to  hours in some cases becauseIsaac Rodrguez' original instructions had not only been to cut off theelectricity but also to tamper with the system and sabotage the machineryenabling it to be quickly restored. At the same time the SITIRHE officialswere carrying out their strike on  March , there was an attemptedmilitary coup headed by a colonel who had permanent contacts with IsaacRodrguez and even had a meeting with him on  March . Similarly, on March , there was a demonstration in the city of Panama with a massiveturnout of workers convened by the SITIRHE; and there is documentary evidencethat Isaac Rodrguez and other trade union officials were handing out arms onthis occasion. An arrest warrant was issued against Isaac Rodrguez on accountof his participation in the events of  March  and he was charged withhaving committed offences endangering collective security and the internalintegrity of the State. However, he was not arrested and remained hidden formore than two months. The Attorney General also ordered the arrest of Fernandodel Ro, Luis Enrique Hurtado, Angel Julio Corvaln and other trade unionofficials and militants on account of the events of  March. It wasimpossible to arrest these persons because they remained hidden. According tothe documentation sent by the Government, a total of  arrest warrants wereissued.
.On  August , Isaac Rodrguez led a group of workers who, actingon their own initiative and failing to give previous notice or seek anyauthorisation, cut the supply of electricity to the National TelevisionChannel  (ERSA), causing significant material damage, disrupting public lawand order and obstructing the public highway, using vehicles belonging to theBoard. On account of this, Isaac Rodrguez and the other workers were arrestedand later released. None of these workers showed any signs of having beenbeaten; in the particular case of Isaac Rodrguez, this is borne out by theforensic medical report.
.Throughout the month of September, the campaign to discredit the IRHEauthorities and the National Government continued. The trade union officials,Messrs. del Ro, Hurtado and Corvaln called upon the community, by means ofpamphlets and radio announcements, not to pay their electricity bills. On September, they held meetings in the workplaces at Poli, Las Tablas andTorremolinos, where they ordered the workers to stop work without justifiedgrounds, thereby infringing the provisions contained in the Cabinet DecreesNos.  and  of March ; these state that the IRHE, as other publicservice institutions, is an enterprise guaranteeing national security, thusauthorising the army to intervene if the provisions contained in the saidlegislation are violated. In view of the circumstances, Messrs. del Ro,Hurtado and Corvaln were arrested on the basis of the above-mentioned CabinetDecrees and the arrest warrant issued after the events of  March . Mr.Rodrguez Armuelles sought refuge in the headquarters of the Papal Nunciatureuntil the date when he left the country for Spain as a political refugee withthe consent of the authorities who gave him a safe-conduct, in spite of thefact that a warrant for his arrest had been issued and that he was chargedwith the above-mentioned offences. In November , Fernando del Ro wasreleased; Luis Enrique Hurtado and Angel Julio Corvaln were released inDecember and proceedings are still pending against them. They are all chargedwith having committed offences against collective security and the internalintegrity of the State, with abusing authority and infringing the duties ofpublic service, with usurping public functions and committing acts againstpublic authorities, and more specifically with infringing sections , ,
.Furthermore, proceedings were instigated to authorise the dismissal ofMr. Rodrguez, who enjoyed trade union immunity in his capacity as a tradeunion official; the Higher Labour Court authorised his dismissal on thegrounds that he had participated in the events of  March .
.The Government concludes by pointing out that the judicial proceedingsundertaken were at no time prompted by the trade union activities of thepersons concerned but by serious offences against state security; there cantherefore be no question of infringement of Conventions in the field offreedom of association.
.In the present complaint, the complainant organisations have allegedthat after strikes carried out in the electricity sector to obtain wageincreases and better working conditions, the authorities arrested four tradeunion officials and  members of the Trade Union of Water and ElectricityBoard Workers (SITIRHE), searched and closed the trade union premises,confiscated trade union funds and arbitrarily dismissed  trade unionofficials and  workers.
.As regards the detention of four trade union officials and  tradeunionists, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between theGovernment's and the complainant's accounts of the grounds for thesedetentions. According to the Government's reply, the arrests occurred becausecommon law crimes had been committed and mainly because the electricity supplyhad been cut off without warning throughout the country for  hours;furthermore, this action had been accompanied by acts of sabotage and had hadpolitical objectives because on the same day there had been an attemptedmilitary coup by a colonel who was in permanent contact with thesecretary-general of the SITIRHE. On the other hand, the complainantorganisations allege that trade union officials and trade unionists in theelctricity sector were arrested because they had taken part in a strike toobtain wage increases and better working conditions. Furthermore, it is notclear whether the strike in the electricity sector was legal on the day thesupply of electricity was cut off because, although the Labour Code authorisesstrikes in the electricity sector - provided that notice is given and that aminimum service is maintained (sections  and ) - the Government pointedout that on  and  March  the Cabinet had issued Decrees banning strikesin this sector. However, the Government did not send copies of these Decrees;neither did it provide information on the reasons why the general regulationson strikes were amended with respect to the electricity sector.
.In view of the marked contradictions between the allegations and theGovernment's reply and the lack of information on several points, theCommittee feels that it has not been presented with enough information toreach a conclusion on the allegations concerning the arrests of trade unionofficials and trade unionists. Consequently, noting that the four trade unionofficials in question are on bail (one of them is in exile in a foreigncountry) and that proceedings against them are under way, the Committeerequests the Government to send it the text of the judgement handed down inthis case. The Committee also requests the Government to provide details onthe stage of the proceedings against the other  trade unionists who werearrested, to mention whether they have been released and to provide the textof the judgement that might be handed down in their case.
.Finally, the Committe regrets to note that the Government failed toreply to the other allegations (the searching and closure of the premises ofthe SITIRHE, the confiscation of its funds and the arbitrary arrest of trade union officials - the Government only referred to the dismissal of theofficial Isaac Rodrguez - and of  workers). The Committee thereforerequests the Government to reply to these allegations.
.In view of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites theGoverning Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to send it the text of thejudgement handed down in the case against the four trade union officials (atpresent on bail) and  trade unionists accused of having caused the cut inthe electricity supply throughout the country for  hours by carrying outacts of sabotage, and of having committed other crimes. The Committee alsorequests the Government to inform it of the stage reached in the correspondingproceedings and to mention whether the  trade unionists detained have beenreleased.b) The Committee regrets that the Government failed to reply to theallegations concerning the searching and closure of the premises of theSITIRHE, the confiscation of its goods and the arbitrary arrest of  tradeunion officials and  workers. The Committee urges the Government to replyto these allegations in the immediate future.",-1,1988,Panama
100,".The Commitee examined this case at its meetings of November , May  and February and May , presenting an interim report to the Governing Body on each occasion (see rd Report, paras. -, th Report, paras. -, nd Report, paras. - and th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th, th, nd and rd Sessions (November , May-June , February-March  and May )). Subsequently, the IOE sent new allegations in communications of  July and  August . The previous Government sent certain observations in a communication of  October . The new Government sent its observations in communications of  February and  April .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the Committee examined this case at its May  meeting, it formulated the following recommendations on the outstanding allegations (see th Report, para. ):(a) The Committee notes with concern that since its last meeting there have been no basic improvements in the situation of employers' organisations and their leaders in Panama, as evidenced by the prosecution of ten employers' leaders, the continuing occupation of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama and the closure of major communications media used regularly by the employers' organisations.(b) The Committee deplores the fact that the Government has failed to provide detailed information of these specific acts which, in each case, led to the trials pending against nine of the ten employers' leaders (Eduardo Vallarino, Aurelio Barria, Gilberto Mallol, Csar Tribaldos, Rafael Zuiga, Roberto Brenes, Carlos Ernesto de la Lastra, Kaiser Dominador Bazn and Alberto Boyd), and on the stage reached in the corresponding proceedings. It presses the Government to send this information as a matter of urgency and to send it copies of the publications (subversive, according to the Government) produced and found at the enterprise of the employer's leader Alberto Conte and provide information on the stage reached in the proceedings against this leader. It stresses that respect for due process of law should not preclude a fair and rapid trial.(c) The Committee urges the Government once again to take the necessary steps to ensure that the continuing occupation of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama ends immediately.(d) The Committee notes that major communications media have been closed down for months and stresses that the right of workers' and employers' organisations to express their views in the press or through other media is one of the essential elements of freedom of association; consequently, the authorities should refrain from unduly impeding its lawful exercise. The Committee once again expresses the hope that the communications media now closed may recommence normal operations in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of any further developments in this respect.(e) The Committee regrets that the employers' leader Roberto Brenes remained detained for  hours. As no charges were brought against him, the Committee stresses that measures of this type infringe the rights contained in Convention No.  and may create an atmosphere of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of occupational organisations' activities.(f) The Committee requests the Government once again to send its observations on the allegations concerning the arrest and fining of the journalist Alcides Rodrguez and the violence against the leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and their enterprises.
.In its February  report, the Committee noted that the new Government had sent certain observations concerning the case in a communication of  February , promising to send additional information and stating that the destruction of certain public offices during the fall of the previous administration, had made it impossible to obtain all the information requested; the Committee stated that it hoped to receive such information as soon as possible (see th Report, para. ).
.The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) alleges in its communication of  July  that section  of Decree No. , promulgated on  May , obliges a large number of enterprises which do not enjoy monopolies of any kind, and whose activities may not be characterised as essential but only as activities of ""public interest"", to maintain their services to the public without interruption, unless otherwise authorised by law or by the competent authority, during normal working hours or during such hours agreed in employment contracts, collective agreements or internal regulations. Non-observance is punished by sanctions imposed by officials of the Ministry of Trade on the basis of denunciations made by inspectors of the Ministry of Labour, and may range from the suspension to the definitive termination of the enterprise's licence. This broad regulatory provision undermines the rights of both workers and employers to suspend their occupational activities in certain circumstances, such as disputes, with a view to reaching a peaceful settlement of their social and economic problems.
.The IOE adds that, in implementing this Decree, labour inspectors, acting on the instructions of the Ministry of Labour, have made denunciations before the Ministry of Trade against a number of enterprises on the grounds that they infringed the Labour Code by temporarily closing their operations on  May  in response to a call for lock-outs to protest the constant infringement of the civil liberties of organisations of employers in Panama and of their leaders. In support of its charges, the IOE sends two notices of sanctions issued on  May  against the ""Restaurante Trapiche"" and ""McDonald's"" enterprises.
.In its communication of  August , the IOE refers to two new instances of sanctions (against the Dairy Queen and Kentucky S.A. enterprises) for the suspension of their activities on  May , on the grounds that such suspensions infringed section  of the Labour Code.
.In its communication of  October , the previous Government states that the premises of the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama are still in the hands of the Public Ministry, as is the property contained therein; since these premises were searched in connection with investigations carried out by agents of the Ministry, their return is subject to the judicial decisions in the corresponding criminal proceedings. As regards the swiftness of these proceedings, the Public Prosecutor has stated that ""it would seem that the accused, rather than the Public Ministry, have an interest in delaying the conclusion of these proceedings, thereby forestalling a decision which would bring the proceedings to an end and determine their legal status, as reflected by the great number of appeals, incidents, requests for permits, requests for bail, etc., which have been filed in connection with each of the proceedings involving persons holding office in employers' organisations"".
.As regards the communications media to which the Committee on Freedom of Association has referred, they are subject to the final decision reached in the corresponding criminal proceedings, inasmuch as they were seized in connection therewith. This, however, should in no way be seen as an effort to undermine or prevent the development of the activities of employers' organisations, which continue to operate in all respects. This is evidenced by information which is published or broadcast daily concerning meetings, the election of executives and other activities for which these organisations were set up.
.As regards developments in the trials of ten employers' leaders, the Government recalls that the Public Prosecutor reported that, on  December , Decree No.  granted a pardon to a number of persons who were associated with the commission of common law and political crimes. The persons who benefited from these pardons included Aurelio Antonio Barria Mock, Eduardo Vallarino Arjona, Gilberto Mallot Tamayo, Csar Augusto Tribaldos, Rafael Zuiga Brid and Carlos E. Gonzlez de la Lastra. Subsequently, following new attacks on the State's internal security, the Eighth Prosecutor of the First Judicial Circuit of Panama requested unsworn statements from the leaders of the so-called ""National Civil Crusade"", including Carlos Ernesto Gonzlez de la Lastra and Alberto Boyd, ""who were found guilty of having participated directly in the crime, and were detained in accordance with procedural regulations"". Messrs. Boyd and Gonzlez de la Lastra were subsequently released on bail. Mr. de la Lastra requested permission to leave the country temporarily, while Mr. Boyd is free on bond and free to go about his personal and occupational activities.
.The Government adds that Messrs. Vallarino and Mallot posted bond so as not to be detained during the investigations being carried out by the First Prosecutor of the First Judicial Circuit against a group of persons charged with crimes undermining the State's internal security. According to the Prosecutor, ""although the examining magistrate has not ordered their detention, other members of the employers' organisation have referred in their unsworn statements to the direct participation of Messrs. Vallarino and Mallot in these criminal activities"". Mr. Aurelio Barria finds himself in similar circumstances. Mr. Kaiser Dominador Bazn has been charged by the Deputy Prosecutor of",-1,1987,Panama
101,"the Attorney General's Department with crimes against the State and the usurpation of public functions; he is free on bail and has left the country on several occasions after having obtained the corresponding exit permits. Moreover, the Prosecutor's report states that ""Mr. Roberto Gonzlez Brenes, while free on bail, engaged in acts which undermined the State's internal security and the national economy; these acts were in no way related to legitimate activities as a member of an employers' organisation. His brief detention for questioning concerning his commission of crimes was carried out without any infringement of the procedural guarantees established in Panamanian legislation."" As regards the situation of Mr. Alberto Conte, he was ordered to be released on bail by the prosecutor responsible for the corresponding investigation on  December  for humanitarian reasons. This, however, in no way implied that the charges against him had been dropped or that the criminal proceedings brought against him had been concluded. Nevertheless, Mr. Conte proceeded to leave the country without the appropriate judicial authorisation, which led the examining magistrate to maintain the detention order against him.
.As regards the case of Mr. Alcibades Rodrguez, the Ministry of Government and Justice, which is responsible for applying legal provisions on the communications media, states that this person is not registered with the Technical Journalism Council as a journalist. Mr. Rodrguez is registered with the Ministry of Government and Justice's National Media Directorate, as an announcer, but his licence expired on  July . As regards the allegations that Mr. Rodrguez was detained and fined, the Public Prosecutor has looked into the case and has not found any evidence that this person has been detained or fined for any offence.
.As regards the complaint concerning the application of Decree No.  against the Restaurante Trapiche and McDonald's enterprises and others, the Government states that there are no charges or fines against these enterprises on record with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare because of any interruption of operations on  May . Should such charges be brought against these enterprises, the Government would comply with the procedure established for such purposes in accordance with section  of Act  of , under which the party concerned is entitled to due process. Nevertheless, the Government states that the Ministry of Trade reported in writing that it imposed sanctions on enterprises which distribute food and medicine, as well as on those engaged in public activities, which suspended their operations following the promulgation of the Decree, and specifically on  May, following the identification of the same by the inspectors of the Licensing Department of the General Directorate of Internal Trade. All resolutions were notified personally to the parties concerned; some of these resolutions have been appealed, and the cases concerned will be handled in accordance with the law.
.As regards the Dairy Queen and Kentucky S.A. enterprises, the Government states that the charges filed by the General Labour Inspectorate of Panama against them, owing to their suspension of activities on  May , are based on valid legal grounds owing to the infraction by these enterprises of the provisions of section () of the Labour Code. This section requires employers ""to provide the worker with a real and effective occupation, conforming to the agreed conditions"". The charges brought by the official of the Labour Inspectorate comply with legal requirements as defined in section  of the Labour Code concerning the imposition of sanctions for the infraction of employers' obligations, and with section  of Act  of , which outlines all procedures in the event of the violation of any labour standard.
.The present Government states in its communications of  February and  April  that, as is widely known, the Democratic Government for National Reconstruction and Reconciliation was installed in Panama on  December , under the presidency of Mr. Guillermo Endara Galimany, who was elected by the Panamanian people in the popular elections held on  May . The present Government has undertaken publicly within the country and before the nations of the international community to respect the fundamental guarantees set forth in the nation's Constitution, and in particular those found in Title III, Chapter I, which enshrine the full exercise of the individual and social rights and obligations of Panamanian citizens. In fulfilment of this commitment, the national Government has made great efforts to correct the mistakes of the former regime. Consequently, the causes which led to the complaints contained in the cases now before the Committee on Freedom of Association disappeared once the present Government took office.
.The Government states that the premises of the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture of Panama were returned to its members on  December . Likewise, all social communications media, which were regularly used by organisations of employers and which had been closed, have been opened and put back into service.
.As regards the ten employers' leaders who were detained or tried, the Government states that they are free and enjoy fully their civil rights; those who were exiled have returned to the country (as in the case of Messrs. Roberto Brenes and Alberto Conte).
.As regards the case of Mr. Alberto Conte, the Government states that the Fourth Prosecutor of the First Judicial Circuit of Panama ordered the return of confiscated property and rescinded the order which had closed down the AB CONTE enterprise, belonging to Mr. Conte.
.As regards the sanctions which the dictatorship had imposed on the El Trapiche, McDonald's, Kentucky and Dairy Queen enterprises, the Government states that the same have been revoked by the Ministry of Trade and Industry by means of ministerial resolutions. As regards Decree No.  of  May , issued by the previous regime, the Government states that the Ministry of Trade and Industry has been requested to study the possibility of its repeal.
.In the specific case of the announcer Alcibades Rodrguez, the Government states that the Ministry of Government and Justice has reported that its files do not show that he has been denied the renewal of his announcer's licence, which expired on  July . Mr. Rodrguez may request the renewal of his licence before the appropriate authorities if he so wishes (the nation's Attorney General has reported that there are no criminal charges against this journalist in the Public Ministry).
.The Committee takes note of the installation of a new Government in Panama on  December . The Committee notes with satisfaction that the present Government has taken a series of measures which have put an end to extremely serious violations of Conventions Nos.  and , namely: the occupation of the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama, the closing of important communications media used regularly by the organisations of employers, as well as the detention and proceedings against employers' leaders (who are now free and fully enjoy their civil rights).
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the Ministry of Trade and Industry has lifted the sanctions which the previous Government had imposed on certain enterprises for the suspension of their activities (El Trapiche, McDonald's, Kentucky S.A. and Dairy Queen). It also notes that the Government has instructed the Ministry of Trade and Industry to investigate the possibility of repealing Decree No.  of  May  (which allows the Government to oblige certain ""public utilities"" to remain operational, without interruption, under pain of sanctions), which was used to violate the rights of employers' organisations. Finally, it observes that there are no criminal proceedings pending against the journalist Alcibades Rodrguez, who is free to request the renewal of his announcer's licence.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) the Committee notes with satisfaction the measures adopted by the present Government in relation to employers' organisations and their leaders, which bring an end to the very serious violations of Conventions Nos.  and , which had occurred during the previous Government; and(b) the Committee notes with interest that the Ministry of Trade and Industry is studying the possibility of repealing Decree No.  of  May  (which authorises the Government to oblige certain ""public utilities"" to remain operational, without interruption, under pain of sanctions), which was used to violate the rights of employers' organisations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on this matter.
.The Committee examined this case at its November , May  andFebruary  meetings and submitted an interim report to the Governing Bodyon three occasions (see rd Report, paragraphs -, th Report,paragraphs -, and nd Report, paragraphs -, approved by theGoverning Body at its th Session (November ), its th Session(May-June ) and nd Session (February-March )). Subsequently, theGovernment submitted several observations in communications dated  February
.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection ofthe Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise andCollective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the Government regrets the recommendationstaken in its last report since, according to the Government, the",-1,1987,Panama
102,"Committeecontinues to consider actions taken by the Public Prosecutor in accordancewith penal law (occupation of the premises of two employers' organisations,confiscation of their goods and closure of means of communication used by theemployers' organisations) as violations of freedom of association; it statesthat these actions were taken because of repeated offences committed bypersons attempting to undermine internal state security and the nationaleconomy and to paralyse the electoral process leading up to the elections on 
.In this respect, the Committee feels bound to point out that whenexamining the allegations submitted in this case, it has always proceeded withthe maximum caution and objectivity, taking fully into account theGovernment's statements - especially when it insisted that the measuresobjected to in the allegations were taken within the process of criminalproceedings. On this point, the Committee recalls that, concerning the trialsof ten employers' officials, it merely requested information on the specificallegations brought against each of those concerned and expressed its concernabout the seriousness of the situation, precisely so that it might have enoughinformation to be able to reach a decision on this case. The Committee regretsthat in spite of its repeated demands, it has not received this informationand that the Government continues merely to make statements of a generalnature. Consequently, as it did at its previous meeting, the Committeereiterates its request for information and stresses that respect for dueprocess of law should not preclude the possibility of a fair and rapid trialand that, on the contrary, an excessive delay may intimidate the employers'leaders concerned, thus having repercussions on the exercise of theiractivities. As regards the continued occupation of the Chamber of Commerce andthe Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama and the confiscation of theirgoods, the Committee points out that these organisations have been deprived oftheir premises for more than one year now and considers that the fact thatsome employers' leaders from these organisations are under investigation doesnot justify that these organisations and their members are deprived of a basicmeans whereby they may carry out their normal activities. Finally, as regardsthe closure of major communications media used regularly by the employers'organisations, the Committee cannot accept the Government's statement to theeffect that such organisations may use other communications media existing inthe country since it may be wondered if the employers' organisations are ofthe same persuasion as the communications media existing at present and ifthey would have the same facilities of access to these media as to those whichhave been closed. The Committee therefore upholds its previous conclusions andrecommendations on all these points.
.As regards the alleged arbitrary detention of the employer's leaderAlberto Conte, the breaking into, searching and closure of his enterprise andthe confiscation of his goods, the Committee notes that according to theGovernment such actions are provided for in procedural law and that they werecarried out as part of a criminal investigation, initiated by the PublicProsecutor after it was discovered that the offices of Mr. Conte's enterprisehad been used as a centre for editing and publishing material which called forthe disruption of public law and order with a view to undermining the securityof the state's powers - punishable under section  of the Penal Code. TheCommittee notes that Mr. Conte was released on bail on  December  andthat he left the country on the same day; however, they note that a newdetention order was issued against him later. In order to be in a position toreach a decision on these allegations, the Committee requests the Governmentto send it a copy of the publications found in Mr. Conte's factory and toinform it on the stage reached in the proceedings against him.
.As regards the allegation that the employers' leader Roberto Brenes wasdeported to Miami on  December  on the grounds of having carried outsubversive activities and that this was presented by the authorities as avoluntary exile (see nd Report, Case No. , paragraph ), theCommittee notes that the Government states that on  December , RobertoBrenes was detained for less than  hours to make a statement and that therewas serious evidence of his participation in activities against internal statesecurity. According to the Government, there are no criminal proceedingspending against Roberto Brenes. As no charges were brought against RobertoBrenes, the Committee regrets that he remained in detention for nearly hours and stresses that such measures may create an atmosphere of intimidationand fear prejudicial to the normal development of occupational organisations'activities, as provided for under Convention No. . Furthermore, theCommittee notes that the Government has denied the allegation that, after hisdetention, the employer's leader Roberto Brenes was obliged by force to takethe plane to Miami.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied tothe other allegations pending (arrest and fining of the journalist AlcidesRodrguez, and violence against the leaders of the Chamber of Commerce andtheir enterprises). Consequently, the Committee reiterates its previousconclusions and recommendations in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committeeinvites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes with concern that since its last meeting there havebeen no basic improvements in the situation of employers' organisations andtheir leaders in Panama, as evidenced by the prosecution of ten employers'leaders, the continuing occupation of the premises of the Chamber of Commerceand the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama and the closure of majorcommunications media used regularly by the employers' organisations.b) The Committee deplores the fact that the Government has failed toprovide detailed information of these specific acts which, in each case, ledto the trials pending against nine of the ten employers' leaders (EduardoVallarino, Aurelio Barria, Gilberto Mallol, Csar Tribaldos, Rafael Zuiga,Roberto Brenes, Carlos Ernesto de la Lastra, Kaiser Dominador Bazn andAlberto Boyd), and on the stage reached in the corresponding proceedings. Itpresses the Government to send this information as a matter of urgency and tosend it copies of the publications (subversive, according to the Government)produced and found at the enterprise of the employer's leader Alberto Conteand provide information on the stage reached in the proceedings against thisleader. It stresses that respect for due process of law should not preclude afair and rapid trial.c) The Committee urges the Government once again to take the necessarysteps to ensure that the continuing occupation of the premises of the Chamberof Commerce and the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama ends immediately.d) The Committee notes that major communications media have been closeddown for months and stresses that the right of workers' and employers'organisations to express their views in the press or through other media isone of the essential elements of freedom of association; consequently, theauthorities should refrain from unduly impeding its lawful exercise. TheCommittee once again expresses the hope that the communications media nowclosed may recommence normal operations in the very near future and requeststhe Government to keep it informed of any further developments in thisrespect.e) The Committee regrets that the employers' leader Roberto Brenes remaineddetained for  hours. As no charges were brought against him, the Committeestresses that measures of this type infringe the rights contained inConvention No.  and may create an atmosphere of intimidation and fearprejudicial to the normal development of occupational organisations'activities.f) The Committee requests the Government once again to send itsobservations on the allegations concerning the arrest and fining of thejournalist Alcides Rodrguez and the violence against the leaders of theChamber of Commerce and their enterprises.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  and May  meetings and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body on both occasions (see rd Report, paras. - and th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ) and th Session (May-June )). The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) subsequently sent new allegations in communications dated  July,  October,  November and  December . The Government replied in communications dated  May and  October  and  January .
.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.When the Committee examined this case at its May  meeting, it made the following recommendations on the pending allegations (see th Report, para. ).a) The Committee notes with concern that, despite the Amnesty Act of , new events have occurred, including the prosecution of eight employers' leaders, the extended occupation of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce and the closure of major communications media.b) The Committee requests the Government to send detailed information on these specific acts which, in each case, led to the proceedings against the eight employers' leaders, and on the state of the proceedings and the situation of the persons concerned (in particular indicating whether they are detained or a warrant has been issued for their arrest); the Committee also requests the Government to send its observations, as a matter of urgency, on the allegations relating to the continued occupation of the Chamber of Commerce and the closure of major communications media.c) Finally, the Committee once again requests the Government to respond to the allegation relating to the violence perpetrated or tolerated by the",-1,1987,Panama
103,"police against leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and their undertakings during the months of June and July .
.In its communication of  July , the IOE alleges that the premises of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture of Panama and the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama (SIP) are still occupied by the armed forces and have been since  February and  April , respectively. The IOE sends a copy of the search warrant for the SIP premises and states that the assets and property of this organisation were confiscated. On  May , it was not possible to hold an extraordinary meeting of the SIP in its premises because the armed forces occupying them refused permission for this. The continued occupation of these premises and the confiscation of furniture are not in accordance with the corresponding search warrant. The normal activities of the SIP are thus being disrupted, as are those of the Panamanian Association of Exporters and the Centre for the Development of Productivity, both of which also use these premises.
.The IOE adds that Alberto Boyd, President of CONEP, and Carlos Ernesto de la Lastra were arrested on  February  and released  hours later on bail of $, without having been tried for the alleged charge brought against them of actions against state security.
.On the day and at the place where Mr. Boyd and Mr. Lastra, CONEP officials, were being released, the police arrested Alcides Rodrguez, a journalist from La Prensa, as he was photographing the actual release. His equipment was confiscated and Alcides Rodrguez sentenced, without being able to call upon a lawyer, to  days' imprisonment, which was later commuted to a fine of $ for ""lack of respect for the authorities"".
.Furthermore, the IOE points out that contrary to the statements made in paragraphs  and  in the th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, the newspapers La Prensa, Quiubo, Extra and Siglo have been banned, and the radio stations La Exitosa, Continente and Mundial and Channel V (TV) have been forbidden to broadcast for several months.
.In communications dated  September,  October and  November , the IOE alleges that Alberto Conte, President of the Panamanian Chamber of Advertising Media and member of the CONEP Executive, and Kaiser Dominador Bazn, former President of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture of Panama were arrested, without any charges being brought against them. Alberto Conte's enterprise was broken into and searched and his property was confiscated, after which the undertaking was closed on the alleged orders of the Assistant Prosecutor of the Republic. From a document sent by the IOE, and dated  November , it appears that on the day that Alberto Conte was arrested ( September ), he was not allowed to confer in private with his lawyer. The file of the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic contains no proof or indication that Alberto Conte has committed any punishable offence.
.In its communication of  December , the IOE alleges that on Tuesday,  December , Roberto Brenes, President of the Panamanian Association of Managers of Enterprises (APEDE) a member organisation of CONEP, and secretary of the CONEP Executive, was arrested by order of the police, without being able to call in a lawyer, and on  December was deported. Roberto Brenes is accused of having carried out subversive activities. He denies this charge and challenges the regime to prove it publicly before a court that legally examines his case. As deportation is not provided for either in the Constitution or in the Penal Code of Panama, the police are trying to explain the penalty imposed as ""a voluntary exile"". The IOE encloses the text of a statement made by Roberto Brenes in Miami, where he had been sent by force, published in the Estrella de Panama on  December; in so doing, he was exercising his right of reply to a communication by the police published in this newspaper, according to which he had voluntarily accepted to go into exile.
.The IOE concludes by stating that the actions listed above show the determination of the Government of Panama to intimidate and destroy CONEP and its affiliated organisations, without any consideration for the legal system and judicial guarantees that exist ""only in theory"" in Panama today.
.First, the Government refers to its previous statements to the effect that under Executive Decree No.  of  and Act No.  of  January , amnesty was granted for several political crimes committed between  July and  December ; this resulted in the lifting of charges against leaders of employers' associations amd directors of communications media who made up, amongst others, the politically inclined group ""National Civilian Crusade"" and who had committed criminal offences. Under this Amnesty Act, the equipment and other goods seized by the various branches of the Public Prosecutor's Office were ordered to be returned. Both pieces of legislation were intended to demonstrate the State's concern to achieve a climate of peace and tranquility, thus creating a favourable environment for investment and development from which a sound and efficient private firm might benefit, in accordance with the objectives laid down in the Constitution. Nothwithstanding the above-mentioned government initiative, the persons and associations grouped in the so-called ""National Civilian Crusade"", a movement of a strictly political nature, continued to carry on with its criminal activities aimed at breaching the peace, transgressing the Penal Code and paralysing the country's economic and trade activities; a group of employers' leaders were directly involved in these activities and, to achieve their purposes, they used equipment and materials at the headquarters of their organisations as well as various communication media in order to overthrow the legally constituted Government and disrupt the constitutional system. As a result of this, preliminary proceedings were initiated, by means of various judicial ations taken by the competent authorities, to determine exactly the crimes committed and those responsible for them, always respecting the principles laid down in the Constitution and in the law. In this context, preventive detention orders were issued (section  of the Judicial Code) and measures taken to safeguard the objects under inquiry (section  of the Judicial Code concerning the search of premises and confiscation of goods used in a criminal offence).
.The standards infringed are contained in sections ,  and  of the Penal Code which read as follows:Section : Any person who encourages or directs an armed uprising to overthrow the legally constituted national Government or to change by violent means the political Constitution shall be punished by imprisonment of  to  years and disqualified from exercising public office for a like period of time.Section : Any person who in a public place or through the press, radio, television or any other means incites to rebellion, sedition or riot, shall be punished by imprisonment of between six months and two years and fined between twenty and one hundred days' wages.Section : Any person who through the press or any other means of information disseminates false, exaggerated or tendentious news or propagates rumours which jeopardise the national economy or undermine confidence in the State shall be punished by imprisonment of between six months and three years. If as a result of the previously described actions, there is a depreciation in the national currency or deterioration in the values of state bonds, the penalty shall be doubled.
.The Government stresses that in this case, crimes under the ordinary law were committed against the internal integrity of the State and the national economy; in no event was there infringement of freedom of association. The judicial steps taken were not intended, at any time, to affect the rights and guarantees of the employers' organisations.
.In more precise terms, the Government states that the Public Prosecutor of the First Circuit Court is conducting initial proceedings to investigate crimes against the internal integrity of the State and the national eonomy, in which it appears that many people are involved who are engaged in the activities of the group known as the ""National Civilian Crusade"". This group has objectives of a purely political nature and has repeatedly been involved in activities designed to disrupt the constitutional system. Several steps were deemed necessary to determine whether or not any such crimes had been committed or to identify who committed or took part in them; these included the searching of the premises, during which several items and instruments used in the crimes committed were discovered, and the preventive detention of several people. Alberto Bolvar Conte was amongst those ordered to be arrested in accordance with the procedures laid down by law. He benefited from bail to obtain conditional release but was re-arrested when he committed another punishable act, thereby forfeiting his right. Furthermore, arrest warrants were issued on Eduardo Vallarino, Aurelio Barria, Gilberto Mallol, Csar Tribaldos, Rafael Ziga and Roberto Brenes. Although there was serious evidence against these persons, they requested bail in order to be released and were granted this right. Similarly, they",-1,1987,Panama
104,"requested permission to leave the country and go abroad to see to their commercial activities; consequently, their files have remained for a long period of time in the competent judicial office. It is for this reason that, to date, their juridical situation within the initial proceedings has not yet been determined.
.The Government continues by stating that the Deputy Public Prosecutor of the Attorney General's Office is also conducting initial proceedings to investigate the criminal offences of usurpation of public offices and undermining the internal integrity of the State. Kaiser Dominador Bazn is amongst those linked to such criminal actions. After having made an unsworn statement, during which he enjoyed his constitutional and legal rights in full, he admitted that he had played a direct role in the actions under investigation, upon which the investigating official ordered his arrest. At present he is not detained because he immediately applied for bail.
.As regards the other arrests of employers' leaders, the Government states that according to the Public Prosecutor of the Eighth Instance of the First Circuit Court of the Province of Panama (entrusted with carrying out the investigation on crimes committed by persons belonging to the so-called ""National Civilian Crusade""), there was evidence that crimes had been committed against the internal integrity of the State and security of the national economy and that Alberto Boyd and Carlos Ernesto de la Lastra, leaders of employers' organisations, were involved in these crimes. Consequently, their preventive detention was ordered in accordance with procedures laid down by law, although they successfully applied for bail.
.From the documentation provided by the Government, which comes from the Public Prosecutor's Office, it may be inferred:
.The Committee notes that in the present case, which it is examining for the third time, the allegations basically refer to the arrest and prosecution of employers' leaders, the deportation of an employers' leader, the continued occupation of the headquarters of two employers' organisations, the closure of major communications media and violent acts perpetrated or tolerated by the police against employers' leaders in . In its latest replies, the Government has pointed out generally that: () the present case is involved with crimes under the ordinary law against the internal integrity of the State and the national economy, which prompted preventive detentions and proceedings; () that apart from Alberto Conte, the employers' leaders concerned were released on bail and even able to travel outside the country; () that the arrests, searches and confiscation of goods which occurred were in accordance with current criminal procedures; () that certain communication media had incited the population not to pay taxes and to delay paying for public services; () that in spite of the Government initiative, culminating in the Amnesty Act of  January , which benefited, amongst others, the employers' leaders, people and associations grouped in the so-called ""National Civilian Crusade"", which the Government alleges to be a movement of a strictly political nature, criminal actions to disrupt public law and order, transgress regulations in the Penal Code and paralyse the country's economic and commercial activities continued; furthermore, a group of employers' leaders were directly involved in these actions and, in order to further their aims, they used equipment and material housed in the headquarters of these organisations, as well as various communications media, with a view to overthrowing the legally constituted Government and disrupting the constitutional order.
.The Committee wishes to refer to the conclusions it reached at its May  meeting:While the Committee takes note of the Government's statements relating to the political objectives of the organisation known as the National Civilian Crusade, it wishes to point out... that it is the responsibility of the Committee to determine to what extent the measures taken by the authorities to punish the activities organised or carried out in support of the objectives of the National Civilian Crusade have hampered the exercise of the rights of employers' organisations and their leaders. In this respect, the Committee deeply regrets that in spite of its repeated requests, the Government has not sent detailed information on the specific acts which, in each case, led to the proceedings against the employers' leaders, Eduardo Vallarino, Aurelio Barria, Gilberto Mallol, Csar Tribaldos, Rafael Ziga, Roberto Brenes, Carlos Ernesto de la Lastra, Kaiser Dominador Bazn and Alberto Boyd, and on the stage reached in the proceedings. The Committee does not have this information at its disposal in spite of the fact that in most cases the prosecutions date back about one year. The Committee stresses that respect for due process of law should not preclude the possibility of a fair and rapid trial and that, on the contrary, an excessive delay may intimidate the employers' leaders concerned, thus having repercussions on the exercise of their activities.
.As regards the continued occupation of the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama by the army, the Committee regrets that the Government merely stated in a general way that the employers' leaders under investigation used equipment and material housed in the headquarters of their organisations with a view to overthrowing the Government and disrupting the constitutional order. In this respect, the Committee points out that the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama are still occupied by the army and have been since  February and  April , respectively. Given that the occupation of these premises deprives the organisations concerned of basic means whereby they may carry out their normal activities and in view of the time that has elapsed since the army first occupied these headquarters (about a year), the Committee is of the opinion that this occupation should come to an end immediately and that the goods confiscated should be returned and it urges the Government to take steps in this respect.
.Furthermore, although the Committee infers from the Government's statements that the closure of the newspapers La Prensa and Siglo was on account of articles published on ,  and  January  (supposedly drafted by the Executive of the National Civilian Crusade), inciting the population not to pay taxes and to delay paying for public services, it regrets that the Government has not provided specific information on the closure of each of the other communications media mentioned by the complainant organisation (newspapers Quiubo and Extra, radio stations La Exitosa, Continente and Mundial and the Canal V television channel). The Committee stresses that these communications media were closed down several months ago and expresses the hope that they will recommence normal operations in the very near future. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the right of workers' and employers' organisations to express their views in the press or through other media is one of the essential elements of freedom of association and that consequently governments should refrain from unduly impeding its lawful exercise (see, for example, st Report, Case Nos. , , , , and  (Nicaragua), para. ).
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government failed to reply to certain other allegations: the breaking into, searching, confiscation of goods and closure of the enterprise of the employers' leader Alberto Conte, who was arrested and refused authorisation to confer in private with his lawyer; the deportation of the employers' leader, Roberto Brenes; the arrest and fining of the journalist Alcides Rodrguez whilst he was photographing the release of two employers' leaders; violent acts perpetrated or tolerated by the police against leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and their enterprises in June and July .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes with concern that the situation of employers' organisations and their leaders in Panama is continuing to worsen, as evidenced by the prosecution of ten employers' leaders and the arrest of one of these, the continuing occupation of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama and the closure of major communications media used regularly by the employers' organisations.b) The Committee deplores the fact that the Government has failed to provide detailed information on the specific acts which, in each case, led to the trials pending against the ten employers' leaders, and on the stage reached in the corresponding proceedings. It presses the Government to send this information as a matter of urgency, and stresses that respect for due process of law should not preclude a fair and rapid trial.c) The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the continuing occupation of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Union of Industrialists of Panama ends immediately.d) The Committee notes that major communications media have been closed down for months and stresses that the right of workers' and employers' organisations to express their views in the press or through other media is one of the essential elements of freedom of association; consequently the authorities should refrain from unduly impeding its lawful exercise. The Committee",-1,1987,Panama
105,"expresses the hope that the communications media now closed may recommence normal operations in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed of any further developments in this respect.e) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied: the breaking into, searching, confiscation of goods and closure of the enterprise of the employers' leader Alberto Conte; deportation of the employers' leader Roberto Brenes; arrest and fining of the journalist Alcides Rodrguez; violence against the leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and their enterprises.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See rd Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) subsequently sent new allegations in a communication dated  March l. The Government sent certain observations in communications dated , l and l November and  December l, and l February and  March l.
.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the present case, the complainant organisation alleged the issuing of warrants of arrest against seven employers' leaders (two of whom were in hiding) accused of committing crimes of sedition and of attempting to overthrow the Government; the search of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce and the Panamanian Association of Managers of Enterprises (APEDE) and the confiscation of documents; the banning of certain newspapers, radio stations and television channels; and the encouragement or tolerance by the police of measures taken against certain employers' leaders and their undertakings during the months of June and July . According to the complainant organisation, the confiscation of documents and issuing of warrants for arrest were the outcome of a public demonstration by employers' and other organisations demanding the restoration of civil liberties, the termination of the suspension of constitutional guarantees and a campaign against the economic paralysis of the country and its consequences on employment; the demonstrators called, inter alia, for investigations into accusations of government corruption, murders and other crimes, the application of constitutional provisions to the Defence Forces and the reorganisation of government institutions, the legislative and judicial bodies and the electoral tribunal.
.The Government emphasised in its reply that the warrants for arrest and the searches were part of an investigation conducted by the Public Prosecutor of the Third Instance of the First Judicial District in full compliance with the legislation in force regarding the legal rights and guarantees, following the perpetration of acts defined in the Penal Code as crimes against the internal integrity of the State and against economic security. In its reply the Government stated in particular that citizens grouped together in a movement known as the National Civil Crusade, of which the Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture of Panama and the Panamanian Association of Managers of Enterprises are members, were guilty of incitement to rebellion, sedition and riot and to the non-payment of public services, and that leaflets were written, reproduced and distributed on the premises of the above-mentioned employers' organisations. The Government stated further that mass means of communication used by certain members of the Civil Crusade had been found on the premises and that the population had been incited to hold public demonstrations to protest against government institutions, advocating, inter alia, the overthrow of the national Government. The movement also incited citizens to carry out acts of violence in the streets, such as the erection of barricades, setting fire to property and the use of firearms. The Government pointed out that the legal proceedings instigated were in no way related to the activities of the persons concerned as the officials of occupational organisations and that the Public Prosecutor of the Third Instance of the First Judicial District had placed in the penal investigation file a large quantity of documents and leaflets collected during the search of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture of Panama (some of which the Government enclosed), which, according to the Government, confirmed that crimes conducive to the overthrow of the Government had been committed against the internal integrity of the State and against the national economy.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee emphasised that it was the responsibility of the Committee to determine to what extent the measures taken by the authorities to punish the activities organised or carried out in support of the objectives of the National Civil Crusade had hampered the exercise of the rights of employers' organisations and their leaders.
.The Committee emphasised in this connection that, although the Government had provided general information on the warrants for the arrest of the employers' leaders Barria, Vallarino (both at present in hiding), Brenes, Mallol and Ziga, it had not indicated the specific acts of which they are accused individually; neither had it sent information regarding the allegations with respect to the warrants for the arrest of the employers' leaders Csar Tribaldos and Carlos Gonzlez de la Lastra. The Committee noted further that the Government had not made any specific observations on the comments of the complainant organisation concerning the search of the premises of the two employers' organisations and the confiscation of documents. Indeed, according to the IOE, the report of the search carried out on the premises of the APEDE stated that nothing had been found, whereas the officials of the Public Prosecutor's Office who supervised the search claimed that a large quantity of subversive material had been found. As regards the search of the Chamber of Commerce, the IOE maintained that the police attempted - in vain - to introduce weapons into the premises and that no report is available on the search.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requested the Government to send further detailed information on the specific acts which had led to warrants being issued for the arrest of each of the seven employers' leaders, on the state of the proceedings initiated and on the searches conducted and documents confiscated on the premises of the APEDE and of the Chamber of Commerce (including the report on the search of the latter's premises), with specific reference to the points raised by the complainant organisation. Furthermore, noting the social unrest (particularly within employers' organisations) which had led to the events of recent months and aware that the points noted above still needed to be clarified, the Committee considered that social tension would be relieved if the employers' leaders under arrest, or for whom warrants had been issued, were granted bail and if those who had left the country were allowed to return. While noting the Government's explanations concerning the refusal to grant bail to those involved, the Committee called on it to study the possibility of doing so.
.Finally, the Committee requested the Government to send its observations on certain allegations to which it had not replied:- the arrest of Mr. Conte, public relations adviser of the National Council of Private Enterprise (CONEP), on  October  while disembarking from a plane arriving from the United States, no information having been received as to where or why he is being held;- prohibition of publication of the newspapers El Extra, El Siglo, La Prensa, El Quiubo and La Gaceta Financiera and of broadcasts from the radio stations Continente, Mundial, Sonora and two television channels;- violent acts perpetrated or tolerated by the police against leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and their undertakings during the months of June and July  in the Dant shopping centre.
.In its communication dated  March l, the IOE states that the arrested employers' leader Aurelio Barria had been released. The IOE adds that the premises of the Chamber of Commerce are still occupied by the authorities and that the following communication media have been closed down: Channel  (TV), Radio Mundial, La Prensa, El Siglo and El Extra. The employers' organisations have thus been deprived of the communication media necessary for the normal exercise of freedom of association.
.The Government reiterates its previous statements and points out that the legal proceedings relating to a series of criminal acts committed by certain members of an organisation called the Civil Crusade were by no means aimed at infringing the guaranteed rights of employers and workers to form organisations, such guarantees constituting the very foundation of the country's economic system and social peace. The complainant organisation has sent the ILO several statements and documents containing subjective assessments aimed at distorting the measures adopted by the Public Prosecutor's Office in connection with the direct criminal involvement of some leaders of nation-wide employers' organisations in incidents of a political character aimed at overthrowing the Government. The Public Prosecutor of the Third Instance of the First Judicial District, duly empowered by the national Public Prosecutor's Office in accordance with the principle of independence in carrying out its activities, is conducting the investigation into the presumed participation of",0,1987,Panama
106,"a group calling itself ""Civil Crusade"", led by the executive committee of the Chamber of Commerce or by a part of this and other groups, in committing criminal acts arising out of instigation to ""civil disobedience"". This shows that any allegation of interference by any state official or body is baseless. There is also no truth in the allegations of arbitrariness and illegality of the arrest warrant issued on  August  against Aurelio Antonio Barria, Gilberto Joaqun Mallol Tamayo, Rafael Ziga, Eduardo Vallarino Arjona and Roberto Gonzalo Brenes Prez, since the warrant was issued by a competent official, within the mandate conferred upon him by law. It should also be recalled that the persons concerned have not availed themselves of the legal remedies provided for in the Panamanian rules of procedure.
.The search proceedings referred to by the complainant organisation were carried out in accordance with section  of the Judicial Code, in the presence of lawyers and leaders of the institutions subjected to search. While it is true that no evidence of the crime under investigation was found on the premises of the Panamanian Association of Managers of Enterprises, in those of the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture of Panama, however, a wealth of documentation was found, proving the existence of the punishable act, and was duly included in the investigation file; it is worth noting that the complainant organisation has not supplied a copy of the report of the latter search (the Government encloses a copy of this report).
.As regards the alleged investigations involving public communication media, the Government points out that no judicial measures have been adopted affecting the publication of the weekly Quiubo, the supplement La Gaceta Financiera and the daily newspaper El Extra, although an investigation is being conducted into the publication by the latter of news which is contrary to the security of the national economy, defined as a crime in section  of the Penal Code. The daily newspapers La Prensa and El Siglo are also under criminal investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office in connection with repeated and continuous publication of news jeopardising the internal security of the State, which is protected by penal law. Thus, on the basis of these provisions and in view of the constant repetition of the punishable conduct defined in section  of the Penal Code, the competent official conducted a search in the printing press of the newspaper La Prensa and proceeded to take measures to secure the items which were the object of the investigation, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Judicial Code. The same procedure was carried out by the Sixth Public Prosecutor of the First Circuit on the premises of the newspaper El Siglo as part of the criminal investigation being conducted into the commission of criminal acts jeopardising the national economy, and in particular the crime described in section  of the Penal Code. The temporary closure of the radio stations KW Continente and Radio Mundial was also effected in the context of the criminal investigations arising out of the use of these broadcasting media for activities aimed at destabilising and disrupting the public order, as evidenced by the commission of criminal acts against the internal integrity of the State. It should also be pointed out that the Ministry of Government and Justice is the institution competent to deal with all matters relating to concessions for the use of radio broadcasting frequencies, in accordance with the provisions of Decree No.  of  May , to which a clause was added by Decree No.  of  June , according to which the above-mentioned institution may declare the expiration or cancellation of such concessions ""if there is incitement to disturbance of the public order, to the commission of criminal acts or to non-observance of the Constitution or laws of the Republic and the duties laid down in them, to replacement of state bodies by violent means and to disobedience of established laws and authorities"". No criminal investigation has yet been opened against any television channel, and the Government therefore denies the reference made to this effect in the complaint.
.The Government emphasises that the judicial measures adopted with regard to certain mass communication media have by no means impaired the free exercise of freedom of expression, much less that of employers' organisations. This is evidenced by the publications of various employers' associations, chiefly in the daily newspaper La Estrella de Panam and in the many interviews they have given over television channels and radio programmes, all of which clearly show that the elements constituting freedom of association have not been affected in the least in this country. The Government states once again that the criminal proceedings instigated have not involved any infringement of applicable constitutional and legal procedure, and that at no time has there been any denial of the rights, remedies and procedural guarantees to the persons under investigation, neither has there been any violation of freedom of association of any organisation or person.
.Finally, the Government states that the arrest warrants issued by the Public Prosecutor's Office against Roberto Gonzlez Brenes, Gilberto Joaqun Mallol Tamayo and Rafael Ziga for common law crimes have not been carried out, since the latter have left the country of their own accord. The Government adds that Mr. Alberto Conte was released on  October .
.In its communications dated l February and  March l, the Government states that the organisation called the National Civil Crusade, which was originally presented as an apolitical civic organisation comprised of employers', teachers' and occupational groups, gradually became a political front opposed to the national Government. This is clear from the repeated public statements and proposals made by persons on the executive committee of the National Civil Crusade, the same persons who are the subject of the complainant organisation's concern. The immediate objective of the most recent public statements made by the leaders of the National Civil Crusade is to urge and encourage a coup d'tat as a means of setting up a provisional government. In this connection two paragraphs should be quoted from the document entitled ""Proposal for a programme of transition to democracy"", presented, published and disseminated by the leaders of the National Civil Crusade:""Once the main obstacles to the establishment of rule of law have been overcome, and taking into account the views of the vast majority of the Panamanian people, it is proposed to set up a provisional government Junta comprising three members, who shall act on a majority basis. The present Legislative Assembly shall cease its functions, and the provisional government Junta will assume legislative power, through cabinet decrees, during the term of office of the provisional government, which should not exceed l months.""""In accordance with the principles outlined above, we recommend that the provisional government Junta be constituted as follows: one member appointed by the opposition political parties and two members appointed by the National Civil Crusade."" Thus, continues the Government, the employers' leaders grouped together in the National Civil Crusade, which is not an employers' organisation, not only intend to claim political power through a coup d'tat, setting themselves up as a government Junta in which they constitute a majority, and assuming executive and legislative power, but also aim to appoint a new electoral tribunal, a new public prosecutor's office, a new supreme court of justice, new higher courts of justice, and new attorneys and public prosecutors. It likewise intends to carry out radical reforms in the management of the foreign debt, of labour-management relations, of education and the public administration, to reform the national Constitution, the institutions of the State and the army, and to reorganise the management of Panamanian interests in the Panama Canal, all of which is to take place according to the will of two members of the National Civil Crusade and one member of the opposition parties. The dissemination of the document entitled ""Proposal for a programme of transition to democracy"" constitutes incitement to totalitarian rule by a group of persons, most of whom are employers, using supposedly occupational associations and interests as a cover in order to seize political power.
.The Government states further that the arrest warrants which were the subject of the complaint presented to the Committee and the searches carried out on the premises of the two employers' organisations have turned out to be fully justified. The persons for whom the arrest warrants were issued have all been identified, some of them by their own admission, as leaders and co-ordinators of the National Civil Crusade, an organisation with completely illegal objectives, as has been shown not only by the evidence in the criminal investigation files, but also by the political ""Proposal"" in which this organisation states its intention to change government institutions by illegal means. Since the penal legislation contains legal rules clearly defining the criminal conduct, it is the responsibility of the State to institute criminal proceedings against those presumed guilty, in this case against those persons who publicly admitted",-1,1987,Panama
107,"to directing and co-ordinating the criminal organisation which is intended to carry out a coup d'tat.
.The Government reiterates that in the course of the searches carried out on the premises of the employers' organisations, evidence was seized on the participation of these organisations in the crime under investigation. On the premises of the Chamber of Commerce, the official headquarters of the National Civil Crusade, a large quantity of documentary evidence was seized, and while it is true that no such evidence was found on the premises of the APEDE, on those of the Chamber of Commerce, on the other hand, documents were found showing that instructions had been sent by telefax from the Chamber for the APEDE to duplicate thousands of copies of subversive manifestos, and identifying the persons responsible for such activities. It is childish to suggest that the police attempted to introduce weapons on the premises of the Chamber of Commerce in the course of the search while in the presence of hundreds of eye witnesses, including innumerable national and foreign press correspondents. If this had occurred, television and film records of the representatives of the press would have been circulated all over the world, and it therefore denies this accusation. There is no contradiction in the statements that no subversive documents were seized on the APEDE premises and that it was proved that the APEDE premises were, however, used for subversive purposes, since they were used as a printing office for duplicating subversive material. Although there may be confusion in press accounts, the fact remains that the National Civil Crusade operated and, moreover, still operates in both premises: those of the Chamber of Commerce and the APEDE. It is not true that the documents seized were confiscated and analysed without the elementary guarantees in order to prove accusations made several hours later; the criminal act was proved by merely reading the documents seized and, subsequently, a thorough and meticulous examination revealed the entire operating system of the illegal organisation and showed the different extents to which various persons were involved in the criminal act.
.Notwithstanding the foregoing, continues the Government, the President of the Republic, by virtue of his constitutional powers, issued Decree No.  of  December l pardoning a large number of persons standing trial and penalties for committing political crimes and related common law crimes which occurred between  June l and the day on which the Decree was issued. The pardon extended to all of the leaders of the National Civil Crusade against whom criminal proceedings had been instituted up to that date. By Act No.  of  January l, the legislature granted an amnesty to all Panamanians implicated in, accused of or prosecuted for crimes against the internal integrity of the State, as defined in section  of the Penal Code, and for crimes against the national economy. This amnesty entered into force on  January l and also provided for the reopening of the communication media which were under criminal investigation. However, the reopening of these media and the return of the leaders of the National Civil Crusade who had fled the country, resulted in the commission of criminal acts threatening the internal integrity of the State and the national economy; these included a substantial increase in the circulation of the above-mentioned ""Proposal for a programme of transition to democracy"", which is a profoundly subversive document.
.Despite the pardon and the amnesty, the same group of persons still runs the organisation known as the National Civil Crusade and, starting in the second half of January, these citizens, all of whom are employers, resumed their subversive activities through the unlawful organisation. These persons include Eduardo Vallarino, Aurelio Barria, Gilbert Mallol, Csar Tribaldos, Rafael Ziga, Roberto Brenes, Carlos Gonzlez de la Lastra and Alberto Conte, who, inter alia, insist on adhering to their political plan aimed at carrying out a coup d'tat and setting up totalitarian rule by employers. The State therefore, mindful of its constitutional and legal obligations, has instituted criminal proceedings in order to protect the legal order and security of society.
.The Committee notes the Government's reply and, in particular, that under the pardon Decree, No.  of  December l, and the amnesty Act, No.  of  January l, the penal proceedings brought against the employers' leaders referred to in the complaint for whom arrest warrants had been issued were annulled, and the communication media which had been under criminal investigation were reopened. The Committee observes, however, that the Government states that, since the second half of January l, new criminal proceedings have been instituted against employers' leaders Eduardo Vallarino, Aurelio Barria, Gilbert Mallol, Csar Tribaldos, Rafael Ziga, Roberto Brenes, Carlos Gonzlez de la Lastra and Alberto Conte, after they resumed their subversive activities aimed at carrying out a coup d'tat, through the unlawful organisation known as the National Civil Crusade. The Committee also notes that the complainant organisation alleged that major communication media were closed down in March l. The Committee notes further the information provided by the Government on the searches carried out in l on the premises of the APEDE and the Chamber of Commerce, including the report of the latter search; however, the Committee notes with concern that, according to the complainant's March l communication, the authorities continue to occupy the Chamber of Commerce.
.In this respect, while the Committee takes note of the Government's statements relating to the political objectives of the organisation known as the National Civil Crusade, it wishes to point out - as it did at its previous examination of the case - that it is the responsibility of the Committee to determine to what extent the measures taken by the authorities to punish the activities organised or carried out in support of the objectives of the National Civil Crusade have hampered the exercise of the rights of employers' organisations and their leaders. In this respect, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent detailed information on the specific facts which, in each case, led to the proceedings against employer leaders Eduardo Vallarino, Aurelio Barria, Gilbert Mallol, Csar Tribaldos, Rafael Ziga, Roberto Brenes, Carlos Gonzlez de la Lastra and Alberto Conte, and on the state of the trials and the situation of the persons concerned (in particular, whether they are detained or whether a warrant has been issued for their arrest). The Committee also emphasises that the Government has not replied to the allegations relating to the extended occupation of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce and the closure of major communication media. The Committee wishes to stress the severity of these measures and to insist that the Government send its observations in this respect as a matter of urgency. Finally, the Committee requests the Government to respond to the allegation that violent acts were perpetrated or tolerated by the police against leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and their undertakings during the months of June and July l.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes with concern that, despite the Amnesty Act of , new events have occurred, including the prosecution of eight employers' leaders, the extended occupation of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce and the closure of major communication media.b) The Committee requests the Government to send detailed information on the specific acts which, in each case, led to the proceedings against the eight employers' leaders, and on the state of the proceedings and the situation of the persons concerned (in particular, indicating whether they are detained or a warrant has been issued for their arrest); the Committee also requests the Government to send its observations, as a matter of urgency, on the allegations relating to the continued occupation of the Chamber of Commerce and the closure of major communication media.c) Finally, the Committee once again requests the Government to respond to the allegation relating to the violence perpetrated or tolerated by the police against leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and their undertakings during the months of June and July l.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) dated  August . The IOE supplied additional information and new allegations in communications dated ,  and  September and  October . The Government replied in communications dated  August and  September .
.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the present case, the complainant organisation alleges the issuing of warrants of arrest against seven employers' leaders (three of whom are said to have been arrested and two who are fugitives from justice) accused of committing crimes of sedition and of attempting to overthrow the Government; the search of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce and the Panamanian Association of Managers of Enterprises and the confiscation of documents; the banning of",-1,1987,Panama
108,"certain newspapers, radio stations and television channels; and the encouragement or tolerance by the police of measures taken against certain employers' leaders and their undertakings during the months of June and July . According to the complainant, the confiscation of documents and issuing of warrants for arrest were the outcome of a public demonstration by employers' and other organisations demanding the restoration of civil liberties, the termination of the suspension of constitutional guarantees and a campaign against the economic paralysis of the country and its consequences on employment; the deomonstrators called, inter alia, for investigations into accusations of government corruption, murders and other crimes, the application of constitutional provisions to the Defence Forces and the reorganisation of government institutions, the legislative and judicial bodies and the electoral tribunal.
.The Government emphasises in its reply that the warrants for arrest and the searches were part of an investigation conducted by the Public Prosecutor of the Third Instance of the First Judicial District in full compliance with the legislation in force regarding the legal rights and guarantees, following the perpetration of acts defined in the Penal Code as crimes against the internal integrity of the State and against economic security. In its reply the Government states in particular that citizens grouped together in a movement known as the National Civil Crusade, of which the Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture of Panama and the Panamanian Association of Managers of Enterprises are members, were guilty of inciting to rebellion, sedition and riot and to the non-payment of public services, and that leaflets were written, reproduced and distributed on the premises of the above-mentioned employers' organisations. The Government states further that mass means of communication used by certain members of the Civil Crusade had been found on the premises and that the population had been incited to hold public demonstrations to protest against government institutions, advocating, inter alia, the overthrow of the national Government. The movement also incited citizens to carry out acts of violence in the streets, such as the erection of barricades, setting fire to property and the use of firearms. The Government points out that the legal proceedings instigated are in no way related to the activities of the persons concerned as the officials of occupational organisations and that the Public Prosecutor of the Third Instance of the First Judicial District has placed in the penal investigation file a large quantity of documents and leaflets collected during the search of the premises of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture of Panama (some of which the Government encloses), which according to the Government, confirm that crimes conducive to the overthrow of the Government were committed against the internal integrity of the State and against the national economy.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the employers' organisations and the employers' leaders implicated in the present case had their rights curtailed within the framework of a criminal investigation because of their links with the National Civil Crusade and their presumed criminal activities within the movement, whose members include various occupational organisations. The Committee takes note of the Government's explanations concerning the nature and objectives of the National Civil Crusade, but observes that some of these objectives comprise aspects of interest to occupational organisations, such as the restoration of civil liberties and constitutional guarantees and the fight against the paralysis of the economy. However, there is nothing to indicate that the National Civil Crusade is protected by the guarantees afforded by the Conventions respecting freedom of association. It is, nevertheless, the responsibility of the Committee to determine to what extent the measures taken by the authorities to punish the activities organised or carried out in support of the objectives of the National Civil Crusade have hampered the exercise of the rights of employers' organisations and their leaders.
.The Committee wishes to emphasise that, although the Government has provided general information on the warrants for the arrest of the employers' leaders Barria, Vallarino (both at present in hiding), Brenes, Mallol and Ziga, it has not indicated the specific acts of which they are accused individually; nor has it sent information regarding the allegations with respect to the warrants for the arrest of the employers' leaders Csar Tribaldos and Carlos Gonzlez de la Lastra. The Committee notes further that the Government has not made any specific observations on the comments of the complainant organisation concerning the search of the premises of the two employers' organisations and the confiscation of documents. Indeed, according to the IOE, the report of the search carried out on the premises of the APEDE states that nothing was found, whereas the officials of the Public Prosecutor's Office who supervised the search claimed that a large quantity of subversive material had been found. As regards the search of the Chamber of Commerce, the IOE maintains that the police attempted - in vain - to introduce arms into the premises and that no report is available on the search.
.In these circumstances, the Committee invites the Government to send further detailed information on the specific acts which led to warrants being issued for the arrest of each of the seven employers' leaders, on the state of the proceedings initiated and on the searches conducted and documents confiscated on the premises of the APEDE and of the Chamber of Commerce (including the report on the search of the latter's premises), with specific reference to the points raised by the complainant organisation. Furthermore, noting the social unrest (particularly within employers' organisations) which led to the events of recent months and aware that the points noted above still need to be clarified, the Committee considers that social tension would be relieved if the employers' leaders under arrest, or for whom warrants have been issued, were granted on bail and if those who have left the country are allowed to return. While noting the Government's explanations concerning the refusal to grant bail to those involved, the Committee calls on it to study the possibility of doing so.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied, namely those relating to the arrest of Mr. Conte, a CONEP official, the banning of certain communication media and the harassment and violence perpetrated or tolerated by the police against leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and their undertakings during the months of June and July (see IOE communication dated  September ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) Given the prevailing social tension in the country and the points raised by the complainant organisation concerning the search of the premises of the APEDE and the Chamber of Commerce, which still need to be clarified, the Committee calls on the Government to study the possibility of taking measures with a view to granting bail - in accordance with their own request - to the employers' leaders who are under arrest or for whom warrants have been issued, and to allow those who have left the country to return.b) The Committee requests the Government to send further detailed information on the specific acts which led to warrants being issued for the arrest of each of the seven employers' leaders mentioned by the complainant (no reply having been received in respect of two of them - Mr. Tribaldo and Mr. Gonzlez de la Lastra), and on the state of the proceedings. The Committee requests the Government to send detailed information on the searches conducted and documents confiscated on the premises of the APEDE and of the Chamber of Commerce (including the report on the search of the latter's premises) with specific reference to the points raised by the complainant organisation.c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied, namely those relating to the arrest of Mr. Conte, a CONEP official, the banning of certain communication media and harassment and violence perpetrated or tolerated by the police against leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and their undertakings in the months of June and July (see IOE communication dated  September ).",-1,1987,Panama
109,".The complaint figures in communications from the Authentic Federation of Workers of Panama and the Authentic Confederation of Self-Employed Workers dated  December  and  May . The Government replied in communications of  February and  August .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  April  the Air Panama undertaking brought before the judicial authority an application for prior authorisation to dismiss Mr. Isidoro Asprilla Marmolejo, Secretary-General of the trade union of the above undertaking, simply for supporting a legal strike on behalf of the workers.
.The complainants also allege that on  August  the CORIP SA undertaking dismissed nine workers who belonged to the Union of Workers of CORIP SA and Associated Undertakings (SITRAECOA), in order to change the proportion of permanent workers who are members of SITRAECOA and to further the Panamanian Union of Workers in the Timber Processing and Allied industries, a union which is controlled by the undertaking. The complainants point out that the administrative authority imposed a fine of , balboas on CORIP SA for unfair practices and attaches the text of the judgement dated  May  ruling on the dismissals.
.Finally, the complainants allege that Fernando Falcn, Eliduvino Snchez and Gabriel Castillo, members of the Executive Committee of the Union of Workers in the Paper, Notebook and Allied Industries have been dismissed, and send the text of the judgement dated  January  authorising the dismissal of these leaders.
.The Government states that on petition from the national workers' leadership and because of the direct interest taken by the President of the Republic, the dispute between Air Panama and the trade union of the undertaking was settled, it being agreed that the application to the judicial authority for prior authorisation to dismiss Mr. Astrilla would be withdrawn and that he would be immediately reinstated in his job. As for the dismissal of the workers at CORIP SA, the Government confirms that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare imposed a fine of , balboas on CORIP SA for unfair practices and that the matter of the reinstatement of the workers was submitted to the judicial authority.
.With regard to Air Panama's application to the judicial authority for prior permission to dismiss Mr. Isidoro Asprilla, Secretary-General of the union of that undertaking, the Committee notes that, on the petition by the national workers' leadership and because of the direct interest taken by the President of the Republic, the dispute between the undertaking and the union was settled, it being agreed that the application which had been made would be withdrawn and that Mr, Asprilla would be immediately reinstated in his job. Consequently, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the dismissal of nine workers who were members of SITRAECOA, so as to change the proportion of permanent workers belonging to that union and to further the Union of Workers in the Timber Processing and Allied Industries of Panama, a union being controlled by the undertaking, the Committee notes that the matter of the reinstatement of those workers has not been raised since, according to the judgement sent by the complainants, the nine workers were reinstated by CORIP SA, with their respective employment relations terminating immediately afterwards by mutual agreement and the enterprise being bound to pay certain benefits. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that the administrative authority imposed a fine of , balboas for unfair practices on CORIP SA, accepting that the purpose of the dismissal of the nine members of SITRAECOA was to further the Union of Workers in the Timber Processing and Allied Industries of Panama. In this respect, the Committee cannot but draw the Government's attention to the importance of the fact that the legislation should establish clear, precise and effective provisions protecting workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers and their organisations.
.As for the dismissal of the trade union leaders, Fernando Falcn, Eliduvino Snchez and Gabriel Castillo, the Committee notes that the judgement authorising their dismissal is based on the dissemination of insults against the employer, and representatives of the management, etc. In the trade union publication ""El Delator"" and which, it is claimed, are included as one of the reasons for dismissal specified in the Labour Code. The Committee has pointed out on previous occasions that the primary role of trade union publications should be to deal in their columns with matters essentially relating to the protection and furtherance of the interests of their members in particular and all workers in general, avoiding any kind of excesses in the exercise of freedom of expression. In this respect, having examined the statements made in the union newspaper ""El Delator"", the Committee considers that, although they cannot be justified by the principle stated, the fact that Messrs. Falcn, Snchez and Castillo expressed themselves as trade unions leaders and in a context of occupational demands should not have incurred a penalty as serious as dismissal. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to reinstate the trade union leaders in their former jobs.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) As regards application to the judicial authority for prior authorisation to dismiss the trade union leader Isidoro Asprilla, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.(b) As regards the dismissal of workers who belonged to SITRAECOA so as to further the interests of a trade union controlled by the undertaking, the Committee calls the Government's attention to the importance of the fact that the legislation should establish clear, precise and effective provisions protecting workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers or their organisations.(c) As regards the dismissal of the trade union leaders Fernando Flacn, Eliduvino Snchez and Gabriel Castillo, the Committee requests the Government to take measures aimed at facilitating their reinstatement in their former jobs.",0,1981,Panama
110,".The complaint appears in a communication from the National Council of Private Enterprise of the Republic of Panama (CONEP) dated  June . The Government replied in a communication dated  August .
.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.CONEP alleges that sections  and  of Act No. , dated  June , institute general wage increases and modify all the wages agreed upon in the collective agreements in force, thus infringing the freedom of association. Conventions ratified by Panama.
.The complainant adds that the promulgated wage measures neither encourage nor promote collective bargaining and that the increases imposed by the State reflect an attitude and intention on its part which are unacceptable to the employers and the employers' organisations which have signed collective agreements, the State thus assuming the role of a dictator of voluntarily negotiated conditions of employment and establishing the basis so that in the future such conditions can be altered or modified to the detriment of the employers or the workers.
.Lastly, according to the complainant, the wage increases instituted by Act No.  alter the wage scales freely agreed on between the Panamanian Chamber of Construction and the Single National Trade Union of Construction Workers, as well as modifying all the clauses stipulating wage increases in all the other collective agreements in force; all this contributes to the discouragement of the voluntary negotiation of collective agreements.
.After referring to the aim and essence of the labour law and, more specifically to its function of protecting the worker in view of the position of inferiority in which he is placed vie-a-vie the employer, the Government declares that it acted in the face of extraordinary conditions, given the marked inflationary spiral, and that the policy of encouraging and promoting the conclusion of collective agreements is not incompatible with an extraordinary wage increase measure whose aim is to restore the lost purchasing power of the workers.
.The Government also declares that the average wage of the workers -  balboas - makes it impossible for a great many of them to cover their basic family reeds, especially if it is borne in mind that the rate of inflation in  was . per cent while the average general increase in collective agreements was  cents per balboa, which represents less than  per cent of the average income of the workers. The Government points out in addition that Article  of the Constitution obliges the State to formulate economic policies designed to guarantee to every worker the conditions necessary for a decent existence.
.The Government adds that prior to the promulgation of Act No.  of  June , the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare appointed an Interministerial Commission composed of economic advisers of different ministries to make a study of the national economic situation and the possibility and extent of general wage increases. This Commission, the Government continues, concluded that a restoration of purchasing power would require an increase of approximately  balboas a month.
.The Government points out that after the Commission's report had been presented to the employers and the workers, the former were agreeable to increases in the order of - balboas a month which would include those increases agreed upon in collective agreements for the year , while the workers considered that the increase should be  balboas a month on top of what had been agreed on in collective agreements for the year . The Government states that the increases instituted in Act No.  of  are closer to the employers' proposal and below the amount worked out by the Interministerial Commission.
.The Government declares that, having regard to the circumstances mentioned, the preliminary draft of the Act fixed an increase of  balboas a month for all workers and granted  per cent of that agreed upon in collective agreements. The Government adds that before the adoption of Act No.  of  the Panamanian National Legislative Council, through the intermediary of the Labour Commission, gave the workers a hearing at one meeting and the employers at three.
.In the present complaint, the complainant raised the question of the conformity of sections  and  of Act No.  of  June , which institutes general wage increases in the private sector, with the ILO's freedom of association Conventions.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the measures provided for in Act No.  of  were due to exceptional circumstances and aimed at restoring the purchasing power of the workers in view of the fact that the rate of inflation in  was . per cent whereas the average general increase in collective agreements amounted to less than  per cent of the average income of the workers. The Committee also notes that the average wage of the workers,  balboas, is insufficient to cover the basic family needs of a great many of them and that Article  of the Constitution obliges the State to formulate economic policies designed to guarantee to every worker the conditions necessary for a decent existence.
.The Committee observes that since the employers in the course of the consultations preceding the adoption of Act No.  of  had shown themselves to be in agreement with wage increases in the order of - balboas a month, in which would be included the increases agreed upon in collective agreement for , the dispute surrounding the said Act relates to the increase of  cents in the balboa above the minimum hourly wage agreed on in the collective agreements applying to construction workers hired for specific jobs (section ) and the employers' obligation to grant their workers  per cent of any general wage increases established in the relevant collective agreement (section , third paragraph).
.In general terms, the Committee wishes to underline the importance it attaches to the principle of the autonomy of the parties to the collective bargaining process, a principle generally recognised in the preparatory discussions that led to the adoption by the Conference in  of the Collective Bargaining Convention (No. ). It follows from this principle that the public authorities should not as a rule intervene in order to modify the contents of collective agreements freely concluded. Such intervention would be justified only for cogent reasons of social justice and the general interest.
.In this connection the Committee notes that, after furnishing figures in support of its statements, the Government pointed out that it had acted in the face of extraordinary circumstances in order to restore the workers' purchasing power, adding that the average wage of the workers made it impossible for a great many of them to cover their basic family needs. The Committee also observes that the Government described the wage measures contained in Act No.  of  as extraordinary measures and that it does not appear that the wage increases prescribed by the said Act are disproportionate in relation to the rate of inflation. The Committee observes, finally, that before the adoption of Act go.  of  consultations were held with employers and workers who adopted divergent positions as to the amount of the wage increases to be granted.
.Taking into account the exceptional circumstances of the present case invoked by the Government as well as the Government's statement that discussions took place prior to the promulgation of Act No.  of  June  with all parties concerned, the Committee does not find itself in a position to state that the enactment in question violated the principles of collective bargaining. The Committee does however consider in general that the harmonious development of industrial relations would be promoted if the public authorities, in tackling problems relating to the loss of the workers' purchasing power, were to adopt solutions which did not entail modifications of what had been agreed upon between workers' and employers' organisations without the consent of both parties.",0,1981,Panama
111,".The Committee last examined this case at its session in February , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which is contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.A number of allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises remained outstanding, with respect to which the Government has now forwarded its observations by a communication dated  September .

.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these five cases are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegation. The complaints are contained in the following communications: two from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated  and  January , one from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC), dated  January , one from the International Federation of Secondary Teachers (FIPESO), dated  February , one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America dated  March , one from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industry, dated  June  and one from the National Federation of Christian Peasants dated  September .
.As these communications were received they were transmitted to the Government for its observations. These were presented in two communications dated  and  January .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  January  the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated  January  the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October  had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.
.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of  February  that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since  December . The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.
.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated  March  that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.
.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of  June  that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.
.Lastly, the National Federation of Christian Peasants of Panama stated in its complaint dated  September  that on  October  individual guarantees had been suspended by the Government with the result that rural and urban trade union leaders were being persecuted and imprisoned. The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on  September  in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on  September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.
.In its communications dated  and  January  the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after  October  had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.
.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October . Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations. The Government, for its part, denies, in a general way, any persecution directed against trade unionists and states that no person has been arrested on account of his being a trade unionist, but only for participation in political activities. The Government points out",-1,1969,Panama
113,"that the persons arrested have been set at liberty and states that at the present moment there are no Panamanian trade union leaders in prison.
.The Committee has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency but from its earliest cases it has emphasised that in such circumstances, measures of detention which may involve serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period. The Committee has always emphasised the importance of due process of law in cases in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political character or with offences under the ordinary law and has taken the view, for example, that the requirement of due process would not appear to be fulfilled if under the national law the effect of a state of siege is that the court to which application is made for habeas corpus cannot examine the merits of the case a
.In all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official the Committee, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, has considered that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned. That is why in all such cases, if the Committee has concluded that allegations related to the arrest, detention, or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further examination, it has done so only after receiving observations from the governments concerned indicating sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures taken against the person in question had no connection with the exercise of trade union rights but were occasioned by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. The Committee has also on other occasions pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restriction of trade union rights.
.From the information submitted to the Committee it would appear that the trade union leaders arrested were set free after a longer or shorter period without at any time being brought before a regular court to determine whether or not they were guilty in the course of regular judicial proceedings. With regard to the reasons for the arrests, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent more precise information which would have enabled it to examine the various allegations in full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth above in paragraphs  and , while taking note of the statement by the Government that the detained persons have been set at liberty and that at the present time there are no Panamanian trade union leaders in prison.
.As regards the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to which the Government has not referred in its reply, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to invite the Government to be good enough to send its observations and to indicate the present position of the trade union organisations concerned, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received this information.",-1,1969,Panama

The complaints are contained in the following communications: two from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated  and  January , one from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC), dated  January , one from the International Federation of Secondary Teachers (FIPESO), dated  February , one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America dated  March , one from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industry, dated  June  and one from the National Federation of Christian Peasants dated  September .
.As these communications were received they were transmitted to the Government for its observations. These were presented in two communications dated  and  January .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  January  the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated  January  the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October  had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.
.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of  February  that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since  December . The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.
.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated  March  that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.
.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of  June  that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.
.Lastly, the National Federation of Christian Peasants of Panama stated in its complaint dated  September  that on  October  individual guarantees had been suspended by the Government with the result that rural and urban trade union leaders were being persecuted and imprisoned. The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on  September  in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on  September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.
.In its communications dated  and  January  the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after  October  had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.
.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October . Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations. The Government, for its part, denies, in a general way, any persecution directed against trade unionists and states that no person has been arrested on account of his being a trade unionist, but only for participation in political activities. The Government points out",-1,1969,Panama
119,"that the persons arrested have been set at liberty and states that at the present moment there are no Panamanian trade union leaders in prison.
.The Committee has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency but from its earliest cases it has emphasised that in such circumstances, measures of detention which may involve serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period. The Committee has always emphasised the importance of due process of law in cases in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political character or with offences under the ordinary law and has taken the view, for example, that the requirement of due process would not appear to be fulfilled if under the national law the effect of a state of siege is that the court to which application is made for habeas corpus cannot examine the merits of the case a
.In all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official the Committee, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, has considered that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned. That is why in all such cases, if the Committee has concluded that allegations related to the arrest, detention, or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further examination, it has done so only after receiving observations from the governments concerned indicating sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures taken against the person in question had no connection with the exercise of trade union rights but were occasioned by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. The Committee has also on other occasions pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restriction of trade union rights.
.From the information submitted to the Committee it would appear that the trade union leaders arrested were set free after a longer or shorter period without at any time being brought before a regular court to determine whether or not they were guilty in the course of regular judicial proceedings. With regard to the reasons for the arrests, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent more precise information which would have enabled it to examine the various allegations in full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth above in paragraphs  and , while taking note of the statement by the Government that the detained persons have been set at liberty and that at the present time there are no Panamanian trade union leaders in prison.
.As regards the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to which the Government has not referred in its reply, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to invite the Government to be good enough to send its observations and to indicate the present position of the trade union organisations concerned, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received this information.",-1,1969,Panama

.A number of allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises remained outstanding, with respect to which the Government has now forwarded its observations by a communication dated  September .
.In addition, on  and  January , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) made further allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights in connection with the Government's intention to make trade union membership compulsory and create a single union. These allegations, which constitute Case No. , will also be dealt with by the Committee in the present report, together with the Government's observations thereon, contained in its communication of  September .

122,".This case was first examined by the Committee at its session in May  (th Report, paragraphs -), at which it submitted interim conclusions to the Governing Body and recommended the Governing Body to request further observations from the Government concerning one aspect of the case, namely that of the non-admission of trade unionists to the Committee for the revision of the Labour Code (th Report, paragraph  (b)).
.The case was again examined by the Committee at its sessions in February , May , November , February , May , November , February , at each of which the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the case since the Government's observations on the above matter had not been received. In a communication dated  March  the Government communicated its observations on this question.
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the outstanding allegation that trade unionists had not been allowed to participate in government committees set up for the purpose of the revision of the Labour Code, the Government states in its communication that it does not consider it appropriate to justify the reasons which the authorities may have had when they took this attitude, since none of the officials concerned takes any part in the governmental work of the present revolutionary Government. The Government adds that its policy has, at all times, been aimed at ensuring a harmonious and balanced participation by all sectors of the economy in any action taken which affects their interests. It points out that, when work was resumed on the study of the draft Labour Code, all trade union organisations were asked to make their comments so that these could be considered seriously before a final decision was taken. In this connection the Government encloses with its communication a copy of a letter dated  February  addressed to the trade union organisations requesting their opinion on the draft Labour Code.
.While the refusal of a government to permit or encourage the participation of trade union organisations in the preparation of new legislation or regulations affecting their interests would not necessarily constitute an infringement of trade union rights, the Committee would point out that the principle of consultation, and co-operation between public authorities and employers' and workers' organisations at the industrial and national levels is one to which importance should be attached. In this connection, attention can be drawn to the provisions of the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation, , (No. ), Paragraph  (b) of which provides that "" such consultation and cooperation should aim, in particular, at ensuring that the competent public authorities seek the views, advice and assistance of employers' and workers' organisations in an appropriate manner, in respect of such matters as the preparation and implementation of laws and regulations affecting their interests."" In the present case, the Committee has noted the Government's statement that all trade union organisations have been consulted on the question of the revision of the Labour Code, and, in the circumstances, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the allegation relating to the non-admission of trade unionists to committees for the revision of the Labour Code, and consequently the case as a whole, do not call for further examination.
.The complaint by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) is contained in several communications, dated  August,  October and  December , addressed directly to the I.L.O. Following transmission of the text of these communications to the Government, the latter sent its observations on  April .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the Government's refusal to grant legal personality to several trade union organisations:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the principles set out in paragraphs  and , emphasising the importance it attaches to the standard contained in Article  of Convention No. , which Panama has ratified, according to which workers and employers shall have the right to establish and to join organisations of their own choosing;(ii) to request the Government to be good enough to reconsider its position with regard to the refusal to register the trade unions in question, adopting appropriate measures for ensuring that the application of the legislation is in conformity with the standard in question, and to keep the Governing Body informed thereon;(b) with regard to the non-admission of trade unionists to the committee for the revision of the Labour Code, to request the Government to be good enough to send its observations regarding the complainants' allegations;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report after receiving the information requested.",0,1967,Panama
123,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  February  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions and was communicated to the Government, which answered by a communication dated  August .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that freedom of association has been violated in the city of David in the province of Chiriqui, to the detriment of the Union of Wage-Earning and Salaried Employees of the Slaughterhouse of David (Chiriqui), established at the end of November . For no other reason than membership in the above-mentioned trade union, ten workers were unjustly dismissed, seven on  December  and the other three at the beginning of January .
.The complainants consider that these dismissals violate the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and section  of the Panamanian Labour Code. They quote the text of that section, according to which members of industrial associations which are in the process of formation, members of the executive committees of existing industrial associations and other trade union representatives designated in the Code may not be dismissed, their conditions of employment may not be altered for the worse, nor may they be transferred to other establishments of the same undertaking or to a different municipality without the authorisation of the competent judge. This protection shall be extended for one year after the worker ceases to be a member of the executive committee or three months after he completes his period of service as a trade union representative.
.The Government attaches to its communication dated  August  two reports concerning this case, communicated by the Ministry of Labour, Social Welfare and Public Health. It appears from these documents and the enclosures that on  December , having been informed by a local inspector that the owners of the Chiriqui Slaughterhouse had dismissed a group of workers who were members of the trade union which was at that time being formed, the Inspector-General of Labour ordered the undertaking to reinstate them immediately in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code. At the same time the Inspector-General sent a telegram to the labour judge at David, denouncing the infringement and requesting him to take immediate steps to prevent the violation of workers' rights. In spite of the intervention of the General Labour Inspectorate and the labour judge the undertaking persisted in its attitude; the Inspector-General therefore repeated, in a telegram dated  December , the order to reinstate the workers and pay the wages due to them. On that same day the Inspector-General informed the National Assembly, at the latter's request, of the steps taken.
.As the undertaking persisted in its attitude, seven workers who had been dismissed on  December  took proceedings against their employer and won their case, proving, among other things, that at the time of their dismissal the undertaking's representative knew that they were members of the trade union then being formed. In the judgment dated  July  the judge sentenced the undertaking to reinstate the seven workers mentioned and pay the wages due for the intervening period. With reference, however, to three other workers who had been dismissed on  December  and had also brought an action against the undertaking, the judge concluded that their membership in the trade union then being formed was not known to the employer at the time of their dismissal; the judgment therefore absolved the undertaking from further responsibility. These three workers appealed against the judgment but failed to carry their appeal through, so that the Higher Labour Court declared the appeal invalid.
.The Government sent the complete text of the court rulings mentioned, with the reasons adduced therein and the text of a resolution dated  August  by the Ministry of Labour, Social Welfare and Public Health, recognising the legal status of the Union of Wage-Earning and Salaried Employees of the Chiriqui Slaughterhouse.
.The allegations submitted to the Committee for examination do not appear to raise any points requiring examination in connection with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), referred to by the complainants, but rather in connection with the provisions of Article , paragraph  (b), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has also been ratified by Panama. Under that Article the adequate protection which workers shall enjoy against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities.
.In this case the Government has provided detailed information from which it appears that very soon after the first dismissals the authorities took steps to apply the provisions of national law that prohibit the dismissal of members of a trade union in the process of formation without the authorisation of the judge. The case having been submitted to the competent judge through the normal labour court procedure, judgments were delivered ordering the reinstatement of seven of the dismissed workers and the payment of the wages due to them since the date of their dismissal. Concerning the three other workers in question, the documents in the case do not show that their membership in the trade union in the process of formation had been notified within the required time to the representatives of the undertaking; having lost the case before the court of first instance, they did not carry through their appeal before the higher court.
.In these circumstances, and in view of the fact that the matter of the dismissals complained of has been dealt with through the normal labour court procedure in accordance with the national trade union legislation, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1966,Panama
124,".The complaint of the Trade Union Federation of Panama Workers is contained in a communication dated  June  and forwarded directly to the ILO. The complainants were informed by a letter dated  July  of their right to submit further information in support of their complaint, but they did not avail themselves of this opportunity. The complaint was forwarded on  July  to the Government, which presented its observations thereon in a communication dated  September .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege, though in general terms, that most employers, particularly where there are large numbers of workers, as in large national and foreign undertakings like the CONOCO Oil Refinery or the Chiriqui Land Company, tolerate the existence of trade unions only so far as they are subjected to their will and that in this way they flagrantly violate the trade union rights of the workers, with the consent of the authorities.
.The complainants also allege, without giving details, that the active members and officers of the trade unions are the subject of reprisals and that their names are entered on "" black lists "".
.Finally, the complainants call on the ILO to put pressure on the Government to ensure respect for freedom of association in the country.
.The Government states in its observations that the National Constitution embodies the right to form trade unions and ensures freedom of association to all "" salaried employees, wage earners, professional workers and employers of all classes "". It indicates that when it happens that the legislative provisions in the field are violated, the administrative labour authorities are "" prompt to deal with any such problems, making use, when necessary, of the means that the law empowers them to employ "".
.The Government continues by stating that the law protects in particular the members and officers of trade unions and adds that section  of the Labour Code, which is relevant to the question, is constantly applied by the administrative labour authorities and by the labour court. The Government quotes section  of the Code which is as follows:Members of industrial associations which are in process of formation and members of the committees of management of such associations and trade union delegates, to whom section  () of this Code refers, shall not be dismissed, their conditions of employment shall not be altered for the worse, and they shall not be transferred to other establishments of the same undertaking or to a different municipality without the authorisation of a competent judge subject to the statutory conditions. This right shall be extended for a period of one year after a worker has ceased to be a member of the committee of management, having completed the period for which he was appointed, and for three months after he has completed his period as a trade union delegate.
.The Government then asserts categorically that the allegation that the trade union organisations are subservient to the employers with the consent of the labour authorities is entirely without foundation. In this connection it points out that the organisations to which the complainants seem to refer are powerful ones, the Oilworkers' Union and the Workers' Union of the Chiriqui Land Company each having over , members, and have signed with the undertakings collective agreements whose terms are very often more favourable than the provisions of the national labour legislation.
.The Committee notes that the Government supplies detailed observations in reply to the allegations of the complainants. It also notes that these allegations are framed in very general terms. There is, indeed, no precise fact to support their assertion that the trade unions are subservient to the employers; nor is there any example of the alleged reprisals taken against active members and officers of the trade unions or of their being put on "" black lists "".
.In these circumstances, and taking into account the fact that the complainant organisation did not supply further information in support of its complaint, although it had been offered the opportunity to do so, the Committee considers that the complainants have not proved their contentions and therefore recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case, which dates from , does not call for further examination.",0,1965,Panama
125,".The interim reports submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body in connection with this case are contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee, paragraphs  to  of the rd Report, and paragraphs  to  of the th Report.
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and, subsequent to the date of the complaint, the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still pending refer to a resolution of the Executive of June  interfering with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama (C.T.R.P.), on which point the Governing Body, upon the recommendation of the Committee, formulated in paragraph  of the th Report (November ), invited the Government to supply detailed observations.
.That request was repeated at each of the following sessions of the Committee which, at its th Session (November ), besides recommending the Governing Body to request the Government once again to send these observations, decided to communicate directly with the C.T.R.P asking for information on the present situation.
.On the last occasion it examined this case, at its meeting held in February , the Committee had before it a communication dated  January , the Government stating that it would do everything in its power to send the observations in question to the I.L.O as soon as possible. The Committee moreover noted that no reply whatsoever had been received to the communication sent to the complainants for the purpose of obtaining additional information. The Committee therefore noted that it had no additional information that would enable it to ascertain, on the one hand, the circumstances and legal grounds invoked for the action affecting the C.T.R.P and which, as the Committee observed at its meeting of November , seemed to constitute an infringement of the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or, en the other hand, whether the trade union rights that appeared to have been violated had been fully re-established.
.In those circumstances the Committee recommended the Governing Body, in paragraph  of its th Report, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance it had always attached to the provision contained in the aforesaid Convention No.  according to which workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration, and the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; and to reiterate its request to the Government to furnish as a matter of extreme urgency the detailed observations which it had announced its intention of sending.
.That recommendation having been approved by the Governing Body, it was brought to the knowledge of the Government. By a letter dated  March  the Government sent to the I.L.O a copy of the communication from the C.T.R.P dated  January , the original of which had not been received by the Office, and which contained the reply to the request for additional information made by the Committee to the complainant organisation. The Government confined itself to pointing out that this letter from the C.T.R.P made it clear that the complaint covered the period from June  to December .
.In the letter of which the Government supplies a copy, the C.T.R.P reiterates that resolution No.  of  June  constituted a breach of Convention No.  ratified by Panama. According to the letter, from the date of that resolution up to December  the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama had suffered government interference because an official of the Ministry of Labour, Social Welfare and Public Health had been appointed as its President. Moreover, the Government then in power had exceeded its authority by convening the Fourth National Congress of the organisation for the month of December . From that date onwards the C.T.R.P had carried on its activities freely.
.This additional information confirms the Committee's original impression at its meeting of November  that the measure complained of appeared to constitute an infringement of the provisions of Article  of Convention No. . Nevertheless, the same information shows that the measure in question was taken by a former government and that its effects had ceased in December , the complainant organisation having resumed its activities in full freedom after that date.
.Consequently, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note that the government action affecting the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama in June  ended in December , from which time the Organisation has carried on its activities in full freedom.
.The Committee first examined this case at its th Session (November , see paragraphs  to  of the th Report) and most recently in November , when it submitted to the Governing Body a further interim report, contained in paragraphs  to  of the rd Report. The recommendations contained in the last of those paragraphs are worded as follows:In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express regret at the fact that, despite the time that has elapsed since approval of the th Report of the Committee by the Governing Body (March ) and of the number of reminders that have been sent, the Government has not supplied the detailed observations which were requested in paragraph  of the said report regarding allegations concerning interference, in , with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama;(b) to request the Government once more to furnish the said observations, as a matter of urgency;(c) to note that the Committee has decided to request the complaining organisation to furnish further information on the present situation with regard to the matters raised in the complaint;(d) to note that the Committee proposes in any event to submit its conclusions on this case at its next session..These recommendations were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ) subsequently brought to the attention of the Government by a communication dated  November  followed by a reminder dated  January . In another communication dated  November  the complainant organisation was requested to supply the additional information referred to in subparagraph (c) of paragraph  of the rd Report.
.These recommendations were approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ) subsequently brought to the attention of the Government by a communication dated  November  followed by a reminder dated  January . In another communication dated  November  the complainant organisation was requested to supply the additional information referred to in subparagraph (c) of paragraph  of the rd Report.
.The specific observations which the Government was repeatedly requested to furnish, beginning in November  and on the latest occasion in November , as a matter of urgency, refer to the allegations that the executive power had interfered with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama through a decision, No.  of  June , removing from office certain members of the executive board of that Confederation. On the basis of the information supplied by the complainants (consisting of cuttings from three newspapers) the Committee considered that the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Panama, had been violated, since the Convention provides that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and organise their administration and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. However, the Committee felt that the elements in its possession were not sufficient to enable it to assess the situation, inter alia because the observations made by the Government in its communication of  August  did not contain the specific information that would have been necessary to guide the Committee in considering the case.
.By a communication dated  January  the Government reported that the Minister responsible for such matters "" could not supply the observations requested at the present date but would do everything in his power to send them to the I.L.O as soon as possible "". Up to the present time the Office has not received the observations in question.
.On the other hand, no reply whatsoever has been received to the communication sent to the complainants on  November , although there are no grounds for believing that the communication was not delivered.
.At its present meeting, therefore, the Committee has no additional information that would enable it to ascertain with any certainty the circumstances and legal grounds invoked for the action affecting the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama and which, as the Committee observed at its meeting of November , seems to constitute an infringement of the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). Nor",0,1963,Panama
126,"has the Committee been able to obtain from the complainants any information on the present situation which would have shown whether the trade union rights that appeared to have been violated had been fully re-established or whether the measure complained of still continued in effect.
.In these circumstances the Committee, considering that the specific observations which the Government has promised to supply shortly would usefully supplement the information available concerning this case, recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance it has always attached to the provision contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), according to which workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and organise their administration and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; and(b) to reiterate its request to the Government to be good enough to furnish, as a matter of extreme urgency, its detailed observations regarding the alleged interference with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama.
.The Committee examined this case at its th Session (November ), and on that occasion submitted an interim report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. This was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their complaint of  June  the complainants requested an investigation concerning, inter alia, the exercise of freedom of association in Panama, but gave no reasons for their request. The Committee observed, however, at its session in November , that three newspaper cuttings attached to the complaint appeared to show quite clearly that the executive power had intervened in the affairs of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama by virtue of Decision No.  of  June  dismissing the members of the Executive Board of the Confederation. The complainants had lodged an appeal against this decision with the Supreme Court.
.The Committee pointed out that the Government's reply had not been sent until  August , one year after communication of the complaint. The Government stated briefly that the complainants' allegations were untrue, since all workers were entitled to form trade unions and organise themselves as they wished, subject only to the restrictions imposed by law. All constituted organisations were at all times entitled to exercise their trade union rights and to operate in complete freedom in accordance with the democratic principles of the Constitution.
.The Committee observed that, according to the information in the three newspapers referred to, it appeared that there had been an infringement of the provisions of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Panama, under which workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration, and the public authorities are to refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.However, the Committee considered that it did not possess sufficient information to be able to judge the situation properly and submit any conclusions, among other reasons because the Government's reply was extremely imprecise and general in character and contained no information which could help the Committee in its examination of the case. Accordingly the Committee recommended the Governing Body to decide to ask the Government once more to forward its precise observations on the complaint regarding the Government's action in the case of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama with the least possible delay, and in the meantime to postpone its examination of the case.
.At its th, st, nd and rd Sessions (May , November , February  and May  respectively) the Committee was obliged to postpone successively the examination of the case, as it had not received the observations requested of the Government in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee. Since the approval of the th Report by the Governing Body the Director-General has sent ten communications to the Government, informing it of the said postponements and repeating the request for the observations in question; these observations have not so far been received. The Government answered three of the communications made by the Director-General, stating that the matter had been referred to the competent authorities. In view of this considerable delay and in order to make it possible to formulate its conclusions in this case at its next session, the Committee considers it necessary that the Government should be requested once again to furnish the observations in question, as a matter of urgency. To the same end the Committee has decided to ask the complainants directly to be good enough to furnish further information on the present situation with regard to the questions raised concerning alleged interference with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express regret at the fact that, despite the time that has elapsed since approval of the th Report of the Committee by the Governing Body (March ) and of the number of reminders that have been sent, the Government has not supplied the detailed observations which were requested in paragraph  of the said report regarding allegations concerning interference, in , with the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama;(b) to request the Government once more to furnish the said observations, as a matter of urgency;(c) to note that the Committee has decided to request the complaining organisation to furnish further information on the present situation with regard to the matters raised in the complaint;(d) to note that the Committee proposes in any event to submit its conclusions on this case at its next session.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June , accompanied by a number of documents and newspaper cuttings. It was duly forwarded to the Government of the Republic of Panama, which sent its reply on  August .
.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  June  the complainants asked for an investigation to be carried out into, inter alia, the exercise of freedom of association in Panama, but gave no reasons for their request. They attached a quantity of newspaper cuttings and other documents dealing with various events which had no connection with the principles governing freedom of association, together with various other documents, the contents and implications of which were difficult to interpret without further details. These details were not supplied by the complainants even though they were informed on  July  that under the Committee's procedure they were entitled to submit additional information in support of their complaint.
.Nevertheless the Committee notes that three of the newspaper cuttings in question appear to show quite clearly that the executive power has intervened in the affairs of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama since it issued a decision (No. ) on  June  dismissing the members of the Executive Board of the Confederation. The complainants stated that they had lodged an appeal against this order with the Supreme Court.
.In its reply, which was not sent until  August , the Government stated briefly that the complainants' allegations were untrue, since all workers were entitled to form trade unions and organise themselves as they wished, subject only to the restrictions imposed by law. All constituted organisations were at all times entitled to exercise their trade union rights and to operate in complete freedom in accordance with the democratic principles of the Constitution.
.The Committee notes that, according to the information contained in the three newspapers referred to, it would appear that a breach has occurred of the provisions of Article  of Convention No.  (ratified by Panama), under which workers' organisations are entitled to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their own administration and public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise.
.However, the Committee considers that it does not possess sufficient information to be able to judge the situation properly and submit any conclusions. In the first place, the Government's reply is extremely imprecise and general in character and contains no information which could help the Committee in its examination of the case. In the second place, the Committee notes that the Government has not submitted any report on, inter alia, the application of Convention No. , despite the fact that it ratified it in . On this subject the Panamanian Workers' member of the Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at the th Session of the International Labour Conference",-1,1963,Panama
127,"asserted that Convention No.  was never applied in his country. During the general discussion on this Committee's report in a plenary session of the Conference the Panamanian Workers' delegate referred to news items which had appeared in a number of newspapers and declared that they showed that the Panamanian Government was intervening directly in the internal affairs of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide to ask the Government once more to forward its precise observations on the complaint regarding the Government's action in the case of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Panama with the least possible delay, and in the meantime to postpone its examination of the case.",0,1963,Panama
