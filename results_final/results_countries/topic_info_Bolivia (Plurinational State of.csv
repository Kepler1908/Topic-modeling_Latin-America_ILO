It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners\' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.\n.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers\' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students\' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.\n.The complaint filed under article  of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.\n.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. In April , the Government stated that the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO\'s opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government had also sought the views of certain employers\' and workers\' representatives, but considered that a more thorough analysis would need to be made by all the employers\' and workers\' sectors involved. It therefore had plans for consultations to take place before the new legislation was adopted. Nevertheless, not wishing to create a vacuum during this interim period, the Government had taken a series of measures. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers\' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. This had been done mainly in the following sectors: mines, railways, telecommunications, electric light and power, telephones and airports. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers\' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.\n.In May  the Committee noted in particular that the Labour Code, and especially its provisions as regards trade unions, had still not been adopted. In consequence the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, urged the Government to do everything possible to expedite the adoption and application of the new trade union legislation.\n.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee has examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . According to the complainants, wage claims presented again following the XVIth National Mineworkers\' Congress (May ), and a strike that was planned if these demands were not satisfied, had provided the Government with an opportunity to represent the action not as an economic claim by the workers, but as a political manoeuvre. Consequently, before the strike had been declared in support of the workers\' demands, the armed forces had occupied most of the mining sectors and a series of repressive measures - including the closing down of the FSTMB and of local trade unions in mining areas, the occupation of the miners\' radio stations and the arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade union officials and workers - had been taken against the workers and their leaders. The Government argued that it was really a question of political and even subversive activities by leaders in the mines and other sectors, which had been made to look like action in support of economic claims. The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners\' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.\n.In November  the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts, but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners\' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.\n.In February  the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No.  of  December , whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.\n.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April , the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations.

At its May-June  session, the Governing Body stressed that the miners' broadcasting stations should be rapidly returned to the workers and their organisations.\n.The Committee and the Governing Body also noted the new measures as a result of which some trade unionists - arrested or exiled as a result of the events in the mining industry - had been released or had been able to return to the country. They requested the Government to continue its re-examination of the situation of the other workers and trade union leaders still under arrest or exiled.\n.In a more recent complaint dated  June  (with which the WFTU associated itself), the Miners' Trade Unions International referred to the detention of Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, who was said to be undergoing torture, as a result of which his health had seriously deteriorated. He was allegedly incarcerated in the prison belonging to the Department of Public Order (DOP) in La Paz. The complainants demanded that he be released, along with the many other mining trade unionists who were in prison, and that a stop be put to the repression directed against the miners who had been calling for better living and working conditions.The latest observations from the Government\n.The Government stated in its letter of  August  that Mario Cortez had been released in May ; it added that while he was in custody he was in good health, and that the Government had no knowledge of any subsequent illness. His detention had nothing to do with trade union matters, but was due to the political work of subversive agitation in which Mario Cortez had been engaged in the mines.\n.In its telegram of  October , the Government supplied a further list of mineworkers who had been arrested on political grounds, according to the Government, and had now been released:Roberto Acho Huarita; Juan Alfaro Moreira; Jaime Bernal Alvarado; Alberto Camacho Pardo; Gregorio Colque Capacalle; Mario Cortez Cabrere (see preceding paragraph); Simn Chumacero Facio; Freddy Ferrufino Guzmn; Isaac Gonzlez Cabezas; Manuel Hernndez Veizaga; Armando Iporre Zegarra; Hugo Marne Terrazas; Severo Mendoza Chino; Adolfo Morales Gmez; Victor Orellana Hinojosa; Paulino Palma Lpez (since rearrested, however); Serafn Ramos Quiroz; Gonzal Rivas Mercado; Fabian Romero Gmez; Delfn Saldano Hidaldo; Teodoro Sarmiento Choque; Hugo Serrano Sanjinez; Efran Velasco Gutirrez; Milan Velasquez Jauregui; Germn Zambrana Serrudo; Wilfredo Zambrana Serrudo.The Government also mentioned the names of five trade union leaders or workers in the mining sector who had been able to return from exile. The Committee notes that this latter information has already been transmitted in earlier communications.\n.In more general terms, the Government referred, in its communication of  October , to a speech made on  July  by the President of the Republic before the Supreme Court. He stated that the Government was preparing for Bolivia's return to a Constitutional regime, which would enable the country to accede, through the free expression of the will of the people, to a qualitatively more advanced level. Before returning to a Constitutional regime in the strict sense of the term, during  and  the country would have to go through what might be termed the institutionalisation phase: the people would be consulted with a view to introducing into the national Constitution amendments reflecting the new realities in the country and the prospects opening up as a result. Once these reforms had been approved by the people, continued the Head of State, Constitutional government would be restored in ; nothing could alter that decision. The Government added that the adoption and implementation of new trade union legislation were comprised in the measures to be adopted very shortly as part of the process leading up to the country's return to a Constitutional regime.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its regret that, notwithstanding the time which has elapsed, the principles and standards of freedom of association freely subscribed by Bolivia are still not observed in Bolivia, and to appeal to the Government to re-establish as a matter of urgency, both in law and in practice, the conditions indispensable to the carrying on of normal trade union activity in Bolivia;(b) to note with interest the release of a certain number of mineworkers, including Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, but to urge the Government to continue its review of the situation as concerns the other workers and trade union leaders mentioned in paragraph  as being still under arrest or in exile;(c) in broader terms, to suggest that the Government envisage the possibility of granting an amnesty to the other trade union leaders in exile;(d) to request the Government once again to ensure the rapid return of the miners' radio stations to the workers;(e) to request the Government to communicate, by  February  at the latest, information on any developments in connection with the matters raised in the preceding clauses, and to take note in the meantime of this interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, chairman.\n.The Committee already examined Case No.  in February , November  and February .It submitted to the Governing Body two interim reports and a final report which are set out in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report.\n.In its nd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain information concerning the situation of a number of trade unionists who had been arrested. Despite repeated measures, this information had not been received. The Committee, therefore, addressed requests to the Government in May , November , February  and May  that it provide the information requested. This matter is also covered partly by the complaint regarding failure by Bolivia to respect the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), presented under article  of the ILO Constitution by certain delegates at the th Session () of the International Labour Conference, regarding which the officers of the Governing Body submitted a report to the Governing Body at its th Session (November ). The Government finally submitted information in a letter of  September , which also refers to the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.\n.Regarding Cases Nos. ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: two, dated  February  and  July , from the Latin American Central of Workers; three, dated  February , ""]"
