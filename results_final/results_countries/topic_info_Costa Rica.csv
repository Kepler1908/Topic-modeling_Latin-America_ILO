The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. In June , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code was applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.

According to the Complainants, Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Acua Castro in the elections. It was further alleged that Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO), had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the Bank. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.\n.The Government affirmed that, according to the Social Security Fund, Acua Castro's dismissal constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. Nevertheless, the Labour Court and, subsequently, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos had judged that the suit filed by Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  August , the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court had confirmed this decision. It stated that the judges considered that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Acua Castro were unjustified and ordered the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless considered that Acua Castro had not proved that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.\n.The Government further stated that, on  August , the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for authorisation to dismiss Cristin Sobrado Chaves. The Bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. On  February , Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The Bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the labour judge of San Jos but that the proceedings, which began on  April , were not yet completed.\n.The Committee noted the decision of the Supreme Court concerning Acua Castro. In this connection, it pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts had judged that the trade union official had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to envisage the possibility of reinstating Acua Castro in his employment. The Committee further noted that Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed a long time ago and that the legal proceedings were not yet completed. It recalled the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, and the Governing Body had requested the Government to transmit, as soon as it was pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in the case of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor.\n.In its letter of  September , the Government states that Acua Castro held for several months the post of chief of the technical co-operation and international affairs unit of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which he had left of his own free will to take up a post in the private sector.

The Government recalls the report of the direct contacts mission to Costa Rica (October ) and the report of the Committee of Experts, , which includes Costa Rica in its list of cases of progress, specifically with regard to Conventions Nos. ,  and . Both reports clearly and openly state the improvements which have been made in labour legislation, improvements which go even further than the observations made by the ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the allegations are no longer relevant or have any legal basis.\n.The Government adds that, contrary to what is stated by the complainants, the Government of Costa Rica, pursuant to the agreement reached with representatives of the major trade union organizations in November , began drafting regulations to improve the understanding and implementation of Act No. . The draft was transmitted for consultation to the representatives of the major trade unions, so that they could suggest amendments to the text and then, on the basis of consensus, the final version could be drawn up.\n.It is essential to point out that the Government of Costa Rica, on  August , through a unique move in the history of labour legislation in Costa Rica, designed to bring the country up to date, reinstated the Central Labour Council and submitted a total of  international Conventions and  Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference for consultation to this national tripartite body. The Government is willing now and in the future to maintain permanent and open dialogue with this body on issues of national interest.\n.The Government states that the administration or management of termination funds does not fall to solidarist associations alone. In practice there are provisions, on the basis of a collective agreement, governing trade union participation in the administration of dismissal compensation funds. At all events, the Government reaffirms its decision to support and make the necessary improvements to the Bill on occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund which was submitted to the Legislative Assembly by the previous Government. Of interest to this case, and as called for by the Committee of Experts, is the fact that the Bill does not restrict the administration of dismissal compensation funds to solidarist associations but has clearly made provision for trade union and cooperative organizations to be involved.\n.The Government points out that the complainants\' comments on section  of the Labour Code which prohibits strikes in the public services and the agricultural sector are no longer valid because a Bill on public employment drawn up with ILO technical assistance has been finalized and put before the Legislative Assembly. This Bill, inter alia, governs the right to strike by public servants in non-essential services in public institutions and defines the public services in which strikes are prohibited or restricted, in particular, through the establishment of minimum services. The provisions which drastically restricted strikes are therefore being repealed. As the situation stands, and since the Bill was drafted with ILO technical assistance, it is clear that the exercise of the right to strike, in general terms, complies with the principles of ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the comments made by the complainants in this regard have no legal or factual basis.\n.With regard to collective bargaining in the public administration, the Bill on public employment was submitted to the Legislature in April  and published in the Official Journal (La Gaceta) on  July , in accordance with the national and international commitments made by the previous government. The Bill, inter alia, sets out the principles and general standards governing individual and collective relationships between the central and decentralized public administration and their employees, in accordance with the relevant legal principles. Thus, in respect of collective bargaining in the public sector, Title V of the Bill clearly recognizes the right of association and trade union membership of public employees and the rights derived therefrom. Similarly, it governs the collective bargaining system in the public sector, establishing the scope of application, guarantees for the efficient operation and continuity of essential services, in addition to the aims, conditions, procedures and limits of collective bargaining recognized at the national, occupational and institutional levels.\n.In its communication dated  October , the Government reports that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its competent administrative bodies, has dealt diligently and objectively with all the proceedings instituted by workers and their representative organizations with regard to the dispute in the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd., Proyecto Islas enterprise. These administrative proceedings ultimately led to far-reaching agreements which ended the dispute.\n.In a document dated  April , Mr. Luis Pablo Zuiga Morales, representing SITAGAH and FENTRAP, informed the Ministry of Labour and Social Security that workers on banana plantations , ,  and  belonging to the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. had been on strike for three days because the enterprise was refusing to negotiate the rates of pay for various tasks with standing committees, in accordance with the direct agreement. He also requested that the representatives of the enterprise be summoned to a meeting with a view to reaching a settlement. It should be noted that, far from criticizing the workers\' standing committee, the union\'s request defends and promotes it, contrary to what is stated in the complaint presented to the ILO. On the same day,  April, there was a meeting between the parties to the dispute, at the request of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, at which an agreement was reached, thus ending the strike. On  April  the parties met to begin the negotiations provided for in the formal statement ending the strike. The negotiations were delayed on several occasions between then and  May  because the employer\'s representatives failed to attend. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, throughout this situation, remained diligent and committed to establishing dialogue and understanding, as the records show.\n.Nevertheless, the Government adds, although another meeting had been called for  May , a new unexpected strike broke out throughout the plantations belonging to Geest Caribbean, Proyecto Islas, Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia. At that point, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security took steps once again to reach a settlement. In this context, a number of meetings were organized, which in some cases met with opposition from the enterprise, and it was arranged for the parties to the dispute to meet on  May . On the same day, through the mediation of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, the parties, namely the representatives of the SITAGAH organization and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise met in the office of the Minister and signed an agreement to end the dispute. Subsequently, several meetings were held in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to monitor compliance with the terms set out in the agreement.\n.To date, the third item in the agreement is still to be resolved, hopefully in the next few days, since the legal representatives of the enterprise and the trade union organization attended the tenth meeting of the Committee on Work on Plantations held at the ILO, Geneva, Switzerland.\n.The Government considers that the complainants are misrepresenting the facts by contradicting what they themselves stated in item  of the aforementioned agreement dated  May , to the effect that ""both parties place on record their gratitude to the Minister of Labour and Social Security, Dr. Farid Ayales Esna, for his timely and valuable mediation in this matter. Thanks to his diligence, the parties reached an acceptable agreement in the interests of industrial peace in the Sarapiqu area."" ""Both parties"" means the Geest Caribbean Americas enterprise and the SITAGAH trade union. This was how the situation stood and on the principle of good-faith bargaining and legal security, The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, by acting as mediator and finding a solution to the dispute has shown its commitment to ensuring respect for the terms agreed between the parties, and the case of Geest Caribbean has been no exception, as is clear from the documents appended. They show the Government\'s repeated efforts to ensure implementation of the terms of the oft-mentioned agreement dated  May , in full respect of the ""pacta sunt servanda"" principle.\n.In this context, the Government considers that the complaint is rash, irrelevant and damaging to the principle of good faith since the process leading to implementation of the items in the agreement is under way, and the SITAGAH union leadership signed an agreement settling the dispute, but days later lodged a complaint with the ILO against the', '.The complaint from the Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD) was submitted by a communication dated  August ; that of the Trade Union of Workers in the Electrical and Telecommunications Industries (SITET) by a letter dated  March . SITET presented additional information on  April . The Government submitted its comments by letters dated  November and  December .\n.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The CCTD states that during the th Session of the International Labour Conference () the Workers\' delegate of Costa Rica had accused his Government of trade union persecution and that the Government delegate had undertaken that his Government (including autonomous institutions) would not carry out any reprisals or persecution of any kind against trade union leaders. The complainants add that, disregarding this promise, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (IOE), an autonomous body whose directors are appointed on government advice and in which there is a Minister appointed by the Central Government, had dismissed members of SITET and brought charges against Mr. Guido Nez Romn, Secretary-General of that union, accusing him of having used the right to strike, negotiated the signing of a collective agreement and exerted trade union pressure to that end.\n.SITET states in its letter of  March  that since its registration with the competent administration it has been subjected to considerable pressure from the IOE. Investigations carried out by a special Committee of the Legislative Assembly had revealed that the accusation was justified. A Member of Parliament had then tabled a motion to the effect that the terms of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank should include trade union immunity (fuero) and the obligation to negotiate a collective agreement. The IOE administrators had then undertaken to change their policy towards the union.\n.In view of this commitment, the complainants continue, SITET had submitted a draft collective agreement in April , but one month later the Institute had transformed one of its own credit associations into a trade union called the ASDEICE and granted it all necessary privileges (furnished office, employee, car and driver, funds for the publication of a monthly bulletin, etc.). This ""home made"" union, continues the complainants, had also presented a draft collective agreement. Having received two drafts, IOE stated that the two organisations should first of all reach agreement, knowing very well that the puppet union would not agree to do so. The draft agreement had not, in fact, produced any results. Renewed pressure was exerted to make workers leave the SITET, and although the other union fell into Communist hands, according to the complainants, that did not change the IOE\'s attitude to ASDEICE, some of whose members were even promoted.\n.SITET then submitted a complaint to the Minister. As the manager of IOE stated that the dispute should be submitted to the labour courts, SITET had followed the procedure for the settlement of disputes of an economic and social nature. The parties had been summoned to appear for conciliation, but the IOE had refused to negotiate. SITET had then sought compulsory arbitration, but that had been refused since, under a special Constitutional provision, the Institute was not obliged to go to arbitration. At that point, the workers had decided to strike, although such action was illegal because IOE is a public service. The employer had then dismissed eight workers, all of whom had seventeen years\' service, not for participation in the strike but for unlawful acts harmful to the Institute. The complainant had asked the Ministry of Labour to investigate the unfair accusation and the charges had been proved to be unfounded, but the workers had not been reinstated. Also as a result of the strike, the Secretary-General of SITET, Guido Nez Romn, and other members of the executive, together with the dismissed workers, had been accused of incitement to the collective stoppage, which was an offence under Article  of the Labour Code; their case was under investigation.\n.Since then, SITET stated, the situation had become worse and pressure on the union had increased; workers had been dismissed on any pretext, without any of the benefits to which they were legally entitled. The management had organised what was known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", composed of all the heads of department, who visited all the work centres to persuade workers to leave the union. According to SITET, it even writes letters of resignation for them. The campaign had enabled management to induce , members to leave the union. Whereas, according to the union rules, workers wishing to resign from the union must apply to the executive which then gives instructions for deductions in respect of union dues to cease, the IOE, according to the complainant, applies other methods. SITET is sometimes informed by the accounts department that a worker has decided to resign from the union and that his contributions would no longer be deducted from his pay; in such cases the union receives no other information than that given by IOE. In other cases, the worker sends his letter of resignation to the chief of personnel, who gives instructions for the deduction of union dues to cease and sends the union a copy of the worker\'s letter together with a copy of his own letter to the accounts department. Sometimes the worker communicates directly with the accounts department, which crosses the worker off its list. According to SITET, normal procedures are applied in the case of the other union; workers are not crossed off the list but are forced to remain in that organisation. It adds that it has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Labour but so far has not heard of any action being taken.\n.The second communication from SITET concerns another practice of the same type: it claims that the chief of the personnel office ceased deducting the trade union dues of some workers, whereas the union had merely asked him to suspend the loan repayments to one of the union\'s bodies.\n.The Government replied by two communications of  November and  December . Concerning the dismissal of eight strikers, it pointed out that the action taken by IOE was illegal and referred in this connection to Section  of the Constitution and Sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code. Section  specifically bans strikes in public services and stipulates that any conflicts arising in such services shall be referred to the labour courts. Section  defines as public services all activities performed by employees of the State or of its institutions where the activities of the State or its institutions are not the same as those of private firms or agencies working for reward.\n.The Government submitted a copy of the ruling of the labour court (and that of the Supreme Labour Court confirming it), to the effect that negotiations had been broken off following a threat of strike which it declared to be illegal. Consequently, it is the Government\'s opinion that there were sufficient grounds for dismissal under Article  of the Labour Code. From later talks held with a view to restoring peace between the employer and workers, the IOE had appeared to be prepared not to dismiss workers merely for having gone on strike and to dismiss only those strikers who had acted in a manner prejudicial to the undertaking by deeds punishable under the Penal Code. In the light of that implicit undertaking and at the request of the trade union, the Ministry of Labour had carried out an investigation into the criminal liability of the dismissed workers. Seven of the eight had not participated in any punishable act, but the Institute nevertheless dismissed them, which it was legally entitled to do.\n.Regarding the criminal proceedings brought against the Secretary-General of SITET, the Government states that the IOE had brought legal proceedings pursuant to Sections ,  and  of the Penal Code. The articles in question read:\n.""The sanctions specified in section , increased by one-third for any person responsible for jeopardising the common weal, shall be imposed for:\n.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years for any person guilty of creating a public danger or of impeding or hampering the normal operation of transport by land, sea, air or water, or of impeding or hampering public communication services or public power services in any form.\n.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years and a fine consisting of a percentage of the income earned over a period of from  to  days for any person guilty of having urged officials or employees of public services collectively to abandon their work.""\n.The Government points out that Mr. Nez Roman has never been committed to gaol. The investigating magistrate had ordered ""imprisonment and trial"", but the accused had been left free pending trial and the case had not closed. During the proceedings, the counsel for the', '.The complaint from the Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD) was submitted by a communication dated  August ; that of the Trade Union of Workers in the Electrical and Telecommunications Industries (SITET) by a letter dated  March . SITET presented additional information on  April . The Government submitted its comments by letters dated  November and  December .\n.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The CCTD states that during the th Session of the International Labour Conference () the Workers\' delegate of Costa Rica had accused his Government of trade union persecution and that the Government delegate had undertaken that his Government (including autonomous institutions) would not carry out any reprisals or persecution of any kind against trade union leaders. The complainants add that, disregarding this promise, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (IOE), an autonomous body whose directors are appointed on government advice and in which there is a Minister appointed by the Central Government, had dismissed members of SITET and brought charges against Mr. Guido Nez Romn, Secretary-General of that union, accusing him of having used the right to strike, negotiated the signing of a collective agreement and exerted trade union pressure to that end.\n.SITET states in its letter of  March  that since its registration with the competent administration it has been subjected to considerable pressure from the IOE. Investigations carried out by a special Committee of the Legislative Assembly had revealed that the accusation was justified. A Member of Parliament had then tabled a motion to the effect that the terms of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank should include trade union immunity (fuero) and the obligation to negotiate a collective agreement. The IOE administrators had then undertaken to change their policy towards the union.\n.In view of this commitment, the complainants continue, SITET had submitted a draft collective agreement in April , but one month later the Institute had transformed one of its own credit associations into a trade union called the ASDEICE and granted it all necessary privileges (furnished office, employee, car and driver, funds for the publication of a monthly bulletin, etc.). This ""home made"" union, continues the complainants, had also presented a draft collective agreement. Having received two drafts, IOE stated that the two organisations should first of all reach agreement, knowing very well that the puppet union would not agree to do so. The draft agreement had not, in fact, produced any results. Renewed pressure was exerted to make workers leave the SITET, and although the other union fell into Communist hands, according to the complainants, that did not change the IOE\'s attitude to ASDEICE, some of whose members were even promoted.\n.SITET then submitted a complaint to the Minister. As the manager of IOE stated that the dispute should be submitted to the labour courts, SITET had followed the procedure for the settlement of disputes of an economic and social nature. The parties had been summoned to appear for conciliation, but the IOE had refused to negotiate. SITET had then sought compulsory arbitration, but that had been refused since, under a special Constitutional provision, the Institute was not obliged to go to arbitration. At that point, the workers had decided to strike, although such action was illegal because IOE is a public service. The employer had then dismissed eight workers, all of whom had seventeen years\' service, not for participation in the strike but for unlawful acts harmful to the Institute. The complainant had asked the Ministry of Labour to investigate the unfair accusation and the charges had been proved to be unfounded, but the workers had not been reinstated. Also as a result of the strike, the Secretary-General of SITET, Guido Nez Romn, and other members of the executive, together with the dismissed workers, had been accused of incitement to the collective stoppage, which was an offence under Article  of the Labour Code; their case was under investigation.\n.Since then, SITET stated, the situation had become worse and pressure on the union had increased; workers had been dismissed on any pretext, without any of the benefits to which they were legally entitled.

The aim of this committee is to reach consensus on certain points of the Bill and transmit the results of the study to the members of Parliament, with a view to smoothing the way for approval of the Bill in the near future; () the judiciary has also taken steps to increase its human resources, and to strengthen the functioning of courts, thereby considerably reducing the average duration of labour cases; and () the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is also interested in strengthening alternative means of dispute resolution by the administrative authority, given that efforts in this direction help reduce the number of cases brought before the courts. Under these circumstances, the Committee appreciates the fact that the Government has submitted this issue to the competent authorities and to a tripartite body, and expects that the bills in question will be adopted in the near future.\n.As to recommendation (b), in which the Committee requested the Government to send its observations without delay regarding alleged discrimination in favour of the permanent workers' committees to the detriment of the trade unions, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () this issue was examined by the ILO high-level technical assistance mission which visited Costa Rica in October ; () during the visit, the mission took note of the formal request by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for ILO assistance in conducting an independent inquiry into the issue; () to carry out that task, the ILO appointed Adrin Goldn, Professor of Labour Law at the University of San Andrs (Argentina) in February . The Government of Costa Rica cooperated fully, providing all the logistical and technical support requested by Mr Goldn, and received his report in May ; () even if it might be claimed that there are a wide variety of factors conducive to the existence of more direct settlements than collective agreements, it is true that both institutions have a basis in law and are freely chosen by the sectors involved; however, owing to its constitutional status and its important role in maintaining social peace, collective bargaining is given special protection; () should it be found that a trade union recognized for bargaining purposes already exists in the enterprise, the General Labour Inspectorate shall reject the direct settlement immediately, without assessing its content, so as not to undermine the collective bargaining process; () it is true that the independent expert refers to circumstances which would appear to contradict the commitment under Article  of Convention No. . Accordingly, and taking into account the recommendation of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has sent a complete copy of the study to each of the members of the High Labour Council; and () the Government continues to hope that a satisfactory solution will be found through genuine social dialogue, involving all the social actors concerned, in order to ensure that permanent committees and direct settlements do not have an anti-union impact in practice. In this regard, the Committee appreciates the fact that the Government has submitted this issue to the competent authorities and to a tripartite body, and expects that the measures planned by the Government will enable appropriate solutions to be found to the problem of collective agreements with non-unionized workers.\n.As to recommendations (c) and (d), in which the Committee requested the Government to transmit its observations regarding allegations concerning the Chiquita Cobal enterprise and the Chiquita-Chiriqu Land Company, the Committee notes that the Government has sent information that had already been provided by the enterprises when the case was examined in November . Under these circumstances, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent the requested observations, reiterates the recommendations it made when last examining the case and expects that, together with any information the enterprises might wish to transmit, the Government will send the requested observations in due course.\n.As to recommendation (f) regarding the enterprise Agrcola Santa Mara del Monte SA, in which the Committee requested the Government: () to send its observations concerning the allegations that workers of the enterprise were detained by the migration police; and () to inform it of the total number of workers dismissed at the same time as the trade unionists referred to by the complainant organizations, broken down into unionized and non-unionized workers, to keep it informed of the judicial proceedings under way referred to in the information sent by the enterprise, and to inform it if there were any trade union members among the workers rehired by the enterprise, the Committee notes that the Government has transmitted a report from the enterprise indicating that: (a) the enterprise has nothing to do with the undocumented workers detained in March  by the immigration authorities, and (b) in , the enterprise decided to dismiss  estate workers, including a few unionized workers, with full payment of entitlements, and  workers were later hired, of whom one was a union member. In this regard, the Committee notes that the dismissed workers do not seem to have lodged a complaint with the national authorities, and trusts that, in future, when staff cuts are being planned, the trade union organizations concerned will be fully consulted.\n.As to recommendation (e) regarding the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA, the Committee: () urged the Government to take all steps at its disposal so as to promote collective bargaining between the employers and their organizations on the one hand, and the organizations of workers on the other, in order to regulate the conditions of work in the enterprise concerned; and () requested the Government to send its observations concerning the alleged anti-union dismissal of Mr Jorge Luis Rojas Naranjo and to indicate whether the conciliation referred to in the case of Mr Germn Enoc Mndez Aguirre s dismissal involved his reinstatement. In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government states that the enterprise reported that, in the labour court proceedings initiated by the workers Mr Jorge Luis Rojas Naranjo and Mr Germn Enoc Mndez Aguirre, the parties reached a conciliation agreement, and the cases were shelved as a result. Under these circumstances, in the absence of information from the Government regarding the allegations concerning collective bargaining, the Committee urges the Government to take all steps at its disposal so as to promote collective bargaining between the employers and their organizations on the one hand, and the organizations of workers on the other, in order to regulate the conditions of work in the enterprise Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA, and to keep it informed in this respect.\n.As to recommendation (g), regarding allegations of anti-union persecution of the workers Isidro Snchez Obando (allegedly transferred to other duties), Angel Snchez Coronado, Hermes Cubillo Gmez and Oscar Hernndez of the Cariari and Teresa plantations (owned by Banacol), who decided to become members of SITRAP, as well as pressure brought to bear by the enterprise to force workers to leave the trade union, the Committee observes that the Government transmits a report from the enterprise which states that: () it recognized SITRAP as soon as it learned that there were members of the union among its workers; () members of SITRAP are not persecuted; () Mr Snchez Obando was transferred to other duties because the tasks he had previously been assigned had been discontinued; Mr Hermes Cubillo Gmez was paid the wage difference owed him and reprimanded for verbal and physical assault (long before he joined the trade union); Mr Oscar Hernndez was transferred to another task because he was not carrying out his duties in a satisfactory manner and received a warning in that regard; and () as to the cases of withdrawal from SITRAP membership, a number of workers decided to leave the trade union of their own accord and requested a member of the permanent workers' committee of the plantation, Mr Carlos Ruiz Snchez Marn, to accompany them to the SITRAP offices. The enterprise states that it cannot be held responsible for the actions of third parties unless it is shown that they were acting with its consent. The Committee takes note of this information furnished by the enterprise and regrets the absence of any information from the Government respecting this matter.\n.As to recommendation (h), in which the Committee requested the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an independent inquiry is carried out in the banana sector concerning the allegations that blacklists are being kept, and to keep it informed in this regard, the Committee notes that the Government has requested ILO technical assistance, so that the ILO s interdisciplinary teams and/or advisers can carry out the independent"", ""one, and the Government hopes that, in the near future, it will be able to put forward a consolidated proposal that offers a satisfactory solution to the situation referred to by the independent expert.\n.As to recommendations (c), (d), (f) and (g), the Government states that it has sent a copy of the th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association to representatives of all of the enterprises mentioned: the Chiquita Cobal enterprise, Chiquita-Chiriqu Land Company, Agrcola Santa Mara del Monte SA and Banacol (with regard to the Cariari and Teresa plantations), and transmits the observations of the enterprises in question. As to recommendations (c) and (d), the Government transmits information provided by the Chiquita Cobal enterprise and Chiquita-Chiriqu Land Company, reiterating that provided when this case was examined in November . As to recommendation (f) regarding the Agrcola Santa Mara del Monte SA enterprise, the Government sends a communication from the enterprise stating that, in , a decision was taken to dismiss  estate workers, with full payment of entitlements, in order to reduce the workforce to  in accordance with the needs of the estate. Most of those  workers were non-unionized. Among the  new workers hired, only one worker, Fabio Amador Martnez, a union member, was rehired. As to the workers detained by the immigration authorities, the enterprise denies any involvement with the matter, which concerns undocumented workers.\n.As to recommendation (g) regarding the Cariari and Teresa plantations (owned by Banacol), the Government transmits Banacol s reply to the effect that it recognized the Plantation Workers Trade Union (SITRAP) as soon as it learned that there were members of SITRAP among its workers, and that it gave express instructions to its managers on the Cariari and Teresa plantations in that regard. The enterprise denies that SITRAP members have been persecuted, affirming, on the contrary, that  The exercise of disciplinary authority (warnings, reprimands, etc.) by the employer does not constitute grounds for complaints of anti-union persecution' \n.The enterprise has provided the following statement regarding the workers concerned:' Mr Isidro Snchez Obando s replanting work was discontinued because it was no longer necessary. Once all the plants allotted for each plot have been planted, this work is no longer carried out. This was the case at four plantations, including the one on which he was employed, and hence he could not be assigned the same task, as it had been discontinued. This type of work is known as mantenimiento de resiembra (ongoing replanting), and is carried out to cope with a temporary shortage of banana plants, which was overcome, and as de mata lenta (slow plant) work, which involves tending plants that are growing at a slower rate than normal;' Mr Hermes Cubillo Gmez was paid the wage difference owed to him, as noted in the minutes of the meeting between the enterprise and SITRAP that was held at the Ministry of Labour offices in San Jos on  August . On  September  (long before he joined the trade union) this worker had received a written reprimand for physically and verbally assaulting Mr Mora Mora Gerardo, while he was doing his job. This constituted grounds for dismissal, but the enterprise only issued a reprimand (section (a) of the Labour Code). On  May , he was again issued with a warnings for leaving his post. On  and  April , he was given written warnings for having abandoned his post. These acts constitute grounds for dismissal under sections (a) and (y) of the Labour Code, but the enterprise did not dismiss the worker. How can anyone allege trade union persecution in the case of a worker who could have been dismissed for serious misconduct but who merely received reprimands or suspensions instead of being dismissed;' Mr Oscar Hernndez did not perform his task of pruning plants correctly and his productivity was low as a result. Consequently, he was assigned another task. Such reassignments are often carried out on estates in the case of labourers, who are recruited to carry out all the usual agricultural tasks that are commensurate with their strength, abilities, state or condition and are of the same nature as the core business, activity or industry in which the employer is engaged, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code. This worker received a reprimand on  April  for failing to carry out his duties correctly;' as to Mr Angel Snchez Coronado, the coordinators of the trade union and the enterprise agreed to review the tasks assigned to him and his wages.\n.As to the withdrawal from trade union membership by members of SITRAP, the enterprise states that a number of SITRAP members decided to leave the trade union of their own accord. They requested Mr Carlos Luis Snchez Marn, a member of the permanent committee of estate workers, who was going to attend a meeting on the programming of courses on solidarism at the Escuela Social Juan XXIII in Siquirres, to give them a lift in a vehicle provided for the use of the solidarist association. Once in Siquirres, the former trade unionists asked Mr Snchez, as a member of the permanent committee, to accompany them to the SITRAP offices, which he did. This was portrayed as employer interference in withdrawal from trade union membership. The enterprise cannot be held responsible for the actions of third parties (such as solidarist associations, members of the permanent committee or other workers or middle management) unless it is shown that they were acting with its consent. There is no proof that the enterprise gave its consent with regard to any of the incidents mentioned in the complaints, or that it imposed disciplinary penalties that were not grounded in the authority of the employer.\n.As to recommendation (e), the Government states that the Desarrollo Agroindustrial de Frutales SA enterprise informed it, in letter No. S.OB. -, of  January , that, in the labour court proceedings initiated by the workers Jorge Luis Rojas Navarro and Germn Enoc Mndez Aguirre (heard by the Labour Court of the Second Circuit of San Jos) the parties reached a conciliation agreement, and the cases were shelved as a result. The representative of the enterprise provided certified copies of the court rulings stating that the complaint had been withdrawn and ordering that the case be shelved (both these rulings were handed down by the Labour Court of the Second Circuit of San Jos). The legal representative of the respondent enterprise also provided a copy of the document in which he accepted the withdrawal of the complaint and requested that the proceedings be closed.\n.As to recommendation (h), the Government states that, convinced of the need to implement in national practice institutions enabling workers to exercise their rights at work fully, and in the light of the Committee s recommendation, it considers it prudent to submit a formal request for ILO technical assistance, so that the ILO s interdisciplinary teams and/or advisers can carry out the  independent inquiry' suggested by the Committee, in order to address the allegations concerning the keeping of blacklists in the banana sector and protect the fundamental rights and guarantees of all the workers in that sector.\n.At its November  meeting, the Committee examined allegations regarding the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases involving anti-union practices, the impossibility of exercising the right to strike given that most strikes are declared illegal by the judicial authority, discrimination in favour of permanent workers' committees to the detriment of trade unions and numerous acts of anti-union discrimination in enterprises in the banana sector, and on that occasion made recommendations [see th Report, para. ].\n.As to recommendation (a), in which the Committee urged the Government to adopt in the very near future the various bills currently in progress in relation to the slowness and ineffectiveness of administrative and judicial procedures in cases of anti-union practices, on which the Government provided information, and stressed that they should be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () in letter No. DMT--, of  February , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security requested the Ministry of the Presidency to promote a group of bills that would contribute to strengthening the procedures in question (including the approval of the Bill to reform labour procedures); () it sent copies of the Committee s report to the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Executive Director of the High Labour Council and the Chairperson of the Permanent Committee for Legal Affairs of the Legislative Assembly, to inform them of the recommendations and elicit their views in that regard; () the President of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice stated that he agreed with some of the points made regarding the Bill to reform labour procedures, which is currently before the Plenary of the Legislative Assembly for discussion and approval, and that the Supreme Court of Justice was doing"", 'that the strike had led to misery and abandoned plantations and if they did not want the same thing to happen at Sixaola they had to ""negotiate"" the ""direct arrangement"" being proposed to them. On that occasion attempts were even made to inebriate the workers\' representatives in a restaurant. When the indigenous workers refused the proposals they were called ""stupid and idiots"" by the enterprise\'s representatives.\n.The day after the submission of the grievance ( July ) a worker who had signed the list of claims and who was a member of UTRAL, Samuel Abrego Abrego, was dismissed. The workers Manuel Pineda Becker, Ernesto Abrego Santos, Alejandro Palacios Becker and Hilario Jimnez Miranda were unable even to sign the list of claims as they were dismissed when the enterprise became aware of their intention to sign. More recently, the following workers were dismissed: Dionisio Toms Robinson, Seferino Eugenio Jaen, Venancio Abrego Abrego, Valentn Abrego Santos, Pineda Salazar Marchena, Clemente Abrego Ochi, Genio Pineda Salazar, Leonel N. Garca Estrib, Alejandro Gustavino Chamorro, Celestino Pinda Beker. All these workers have signed the list of claims and are members of the UTRAL trade union. On  August , at the request of the representatives of Isla Grande S.A. and the other enterprises operating in the region, troops from the Civil Guard, Sixaola Commando, on the orders of Major Carlos Brenes, together with immigration officials and in the presence of representatives from the enterprise, blocked the workers at their respective workstations. In order to carry out the operation, which according to statements by Major Brenes was to target illegal Nicaraguan migrants, the Civil Guard troops had lists of workers affiliated to the trade union and of the signatories of the collective disputes and these workers were immediately returned to their place of origin. The enterprise\' objective was to stop the workers reaching their posts in order subsequently to dismiss them for unjustified absence as in the case of Proyecto Agroindustrial Sixaola S.A. (PAIS S.A.), a subsidiary of the National Banana Corporation (CORBANA) in which the State of Costa Rica is the majority shareholder and which sells to Chiquita, which is currently seeking to dismiss workers affected by the ""Civil Guard and Immigration Operation"" carried out on ,  and  August in which the foremen of this enterprise played a special role as ""police officers"" and ""judges"". Despite the complaint immediately lodged by the trade union, on the morning of  August over  workers were dismissed from the plantation, including managerial staff and foremen to give the impression that it was not a case of trade union persecution.\n.In its communication dated  September , the IUF alleges that the conditions of Chiquita workers in Costa Rica are not improving at all as regards trade union freedoms and the free movement of trade union leaders. More specifically it indicates the following:-- the security doors and security guards continue to be a problem in the Sarapiqu sector where they are still obstructing the entry of its leaders and affiliated workers, specifically at ""Compaa Bananera Gacelas"" where affiliation is growing rapidly;-- at ""Isla Grande S.A."" the subsidiary of Chiquita is carrying out a sham sale to another subsidiary enterprise of Chiquita called ""Chiriqu Land Company, Divisin Sixaola"", with the aim of undermining the socio-economic collective dispute submitted by the workers. As is already known, the grievance was allowed and the administrative means of redress have now been exhausted which is why the application for a legal strike was submitted to the labour judge of the Province of Limn. A large number of the workers have still not been reinstated in their posts, in spite of the judge\'s decision ordering the immediate reinstatement of all the workers dismissed in retaliation for having presented the collective dispute;-- the campaign being waged against the Workers\' Trade Union of the Chiriqu Land Company (SITRACHIRI) continues with a view to eliminating the existing collective agreement; this campaign is led by Mr. Ricardo Hernndez Coto, the enterprise\'s industrial relations manager, who has apparently been contracted for this purpose. With the same vigour a similar campaign is being waged in favour of ""solidarity"" with a promoter from the Juan XXII Social School having been called in for this purpose. The executive committee of the solidarity association imposed by the Chiriqu Land Company is made up of administrative representatives, in contravention of legislative provisions established to regulate solidarity associations.\n.Finally, in its communication of  May , the IUF alleges that the banana company Chiriqu Land Company dismissed  workers of the Isla Grande S.A. agricultural complex, who wanted to join the Agricultural Workers\' Union of Citron. These facts took place on  April , a few days after their confirmation of membership had been transmitted to the company, in order to have their union dues checked off. The workers, like many of those who are employed by the Chiriqu Land Company (Chiquita, Unit ) have no protection against occupational risks, are not affiliated to Costa Rica Social Security, and their salaries are not linked to the pay benchmarks set by the National Pay Board, since they were lowered to , colons (US$) for two full weeks of work, without a single day of rest. This salary is also lower than the one agreed upon in their employment contract. In addition, following the fabricated dismissal motives, Mr. Gaitn Fernndez (steward of the Trade Union of Workers of Agriculture, Cattle Raising and Associated Industries, and one of the most militant members of that union) was recently dismissed by the Gacelas agricultural enterprise.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government points out firstly that the complainant\'s allegations of violations of trade union rights are imprecise and that there is no record of such complaints at the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Whatever the case may be, and considering among other things the magnitude of the communication under examination, the lack of evidence to confirm the claims contained in the complaint, the vagueness of its content and above all the deadlines given for the Government\'s response, the competent national authorities proceeded to carry out an examination of the investigations into trade union persecution and/or unfair labour practices submitted by the trade unions involved in Case No. . The protection of trade union rights is one of the Government\'s principal activities and one to which it dedicates considerable attention. The Constitution and the legal system guarantee trade union rights and Costa Rica has ratified Conventions Nos. , ,  and . On the basis of this concern for trade union rights, in May  the Executive Branch submitted for the consideration of the Legislative Plenary, in accordance with the law, a bill for constitutional reform prepared with the technical assistance of the ILO, which would remove the prohibition for foreigners to exercise management positions or positions of authority in trade unions as prescribed in the section under examination.\n.Furthermore, it should be noted that in the current legal system, freedom of association is clearly established in Convention No.  of the International Labour Organization ratified by Costa Rica.
